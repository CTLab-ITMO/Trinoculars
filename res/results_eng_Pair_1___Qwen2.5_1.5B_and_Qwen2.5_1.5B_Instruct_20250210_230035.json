      "For all the money the Washington Redskins need to improve, they may be looking at getting younger.\n\nNFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday that the team is considering a trade for former Indianapolis Colts defensive tackle Arthur Jones, who last season became the first Colts player to reach the Pro Bowl since Hall of Famer Larry Foote.\n\nRapoport added that the Redskins are \"open\" to a deal for Jones.\n\nThe 31-year-old Smith, a Pro Bowler for nine years with the Baltimore Ravens, signed a four-year, $45 million contract that included a $15 million signing bonus -- a total that likely exceeded his true value as he battled injuries and suspensions over the past three seasons because of a lack of discipline and effort.\n\nJones is coming off his worst season. In 2014, he recorded four sacks in 13 starts, but averaged just 18.5 yards per tackle as the Colts finished with two wins.\n\nThe Colts gave Jones a six-year, $58 million extension before the 2015 season, and the deal includes a $19 million signing bonus, making it the second-most expensive defensive lineman contract in NFL history, behind only Jacksonville's Calais Campbell. The $14.1 million the Colts invested in Jones came off the books by the end of the 2016 season, meaning they're on the hook for some of the remaining $10.5 million the three-time Pro Bowler is owed for 2015.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Grigson and head coach Chuck Pagano have spent the past two offseasons trying to trade Jones for more draft picks, and Jones remains at the front of their shopping list.\n\nGrigson and Pagano have spoken privately many times since the end of the season, telling players they want to get younger because they have \"nothing to lose\" with Jones. The Redskins would seem to be at least considering the possibility of moving Jones to right defensive end, where he would be a better fit for the current front.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Monday that the Browns are among a few teams calling the Redskins about Jones.",
      "This article was first published on April 22, 2012, and updated at 12 am ET\n\nUruguay will be able to legalize recreational marijuana in the near future and start taxing it this summer, the country's president, Jose Mujica, said Wednesday in a televised speech from the presidential palace.\n\nMujica appeared before thousands of cheering supporters and guests at the event, organized by the National Commission. A few hours earlier, he had told state TV and radio that \"we should consider legalizing marijuana; it is a subject that affects all of society, and I am in favor of it, but it must be subject to the rule of law and respect human rights.\"\n\nHis announcement came more than a year after Uruguayans voted to legalize marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. But until Wednesday, the country's authorities could not make any moves toward legalizing the drug due to a legal technicality:\n\nArticle 7.2 of Uruguay's Constitution states that no law to legalize marijuana can be promulgated for more than two years, which was the expiration date of President José Mujica's previous, left-leaning government—and a term limit for his successor.\n\nMujica said the provision needs to be removed because the time needed to create new legislation to legalize marijuana is not enough to make a profit off of it. He noted that no country has legalized marijuana for recreational reasons and the government cannot make money selling marijuana as the law currently stands.\n\nThe proposal would not only legalize marijuana, it would give local governments the right to tax it, which many governments around the world are now beginning to do as the marijuana industry grows in size. According to The New York Times, the United States government would be the first to tax marijuana.\n\nUruguay is the first country in Latin America to allow medical marijuana. And the government estimates that marijuana revenues will reach $700 million this year. Mujica argued that his country would also help to fight drug trafficking and crime by taxing the drug.\n\n\"I consider the drug trade—especially in the United States—an international problem,\" he said. \"We need to consider that we are a country that would have a financial stake, as well as a moral stake.\"",
      "SINGAPORE: The government will invest an extra $20 million to help build and run a high-speed rail (HSR), which will link Singapore to the mainland by 2027.\n\nAccording to a draft of the White Paper on High-Speed Rail released by the ministry of finance (MOF) on Tuesday (Dec 12), the fund - around $6.3 billion - is aimed at extending the HSR between the two cities. The MOF said that the country is already investing heavily in HSFR infrastructure but the country has not yet fully tapped its potential, as demonstrated by its failure to develop an effective national HSFR system.\n\nThe draft White Paper also said that the current national plan is to develop a \"sustainable\" HSFR system that will \"enable the nation to realise its full GDP potential in an efficient and cost-effective system, that promotes economic growth through the development and enhancement of economic infrastructure and its quality and sustainability\".\n\nThe draft White Paper outlines two key aspects of the HSR that the government will be providing support for. Firstly, MOF will provide a grant of $10 million to the Singapore-Singapore International Airport (SSI) to build and operate a high-speed rail terminal between the two cities. This will be funded by the MOF's contribution to the Infrastructure to Infrastructure Cooperation Fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecondly, MOF will provide a grant of $20 million to the High Speed Rail Co-Operative (HSRC), a venture of the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Singapore State Railways (SSR), to build a high-speed train to link Singapore Airport, Singapore's central business district. The project, which has previously been proposed, will be funded by the MOF.\n\n\nThe draft White Paper also said that MOF will provide a grant of $600m per year for 12 years to a consortium of Singapore-based companies to build infrastructure for HSR.\n\nWhile the HSR is still an emerging technology, \"the key elements that make up the HSR system\" are in place from a high-speed trains' acceleration and departure control, as well as track and signalling systems, said Singapore-based Singaporean consultancy Wai Chee Meng.\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\"What is not clear is the long-term financial arrangements and the financing strategy for the government's part in the development of the High Speed Rail to reach the destination of [SSR] by 2027,\" Wai said in an email.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, the ministry responsible for the development of the HSFR system, said that the MOF remains committed to ensuring that all public sector parties, public and private sector agencies and private enterprises are involved in the project. However, she added that the \"draft White Paper does not include any funding details for the HSR project beyond the existing commitments already made by the Government to enable it to achieve its economic potential. We are expecting the full draft White Paper within six weeks. We will continue to work with the government and the various stakeholders to implement the full economic benefits of HSFR.\"\n\n\nThe Ministry of Transport said in response that the draft White Paper \"represents a preliminary draft of a proposal to develop high-speed trains for Singapore and Hong Kong, using the existing infrastructure of the country for the initial stages of the operations. We are seeking further clarification from the Ministry of Finance and the MOF as to the precise contents of the White Paper.\"",

      "On Jan. 26, the state's Republican-controlled Legislature passed a $1.7 billion state budget using a combination of tax cuts and spending increases to close the state's $3.9 billion deficit. But on Tuesday, the Legislature failed to pass a third of proposed tax reductions to help close the remainder of the nearly $3 billion funding gap.\n\n\"All indications are that we need to do something else,\" said Rep. Brian Sims, D-Chicago, who had previously been a leading advocate for tax increases to close the projected deficit. \"I think at this point it's time to look at other sources.\"\n\nSims said he wouldn't be surprised if Congress would be involved in solving the state's budget problems – though he is skeptical that new revenue would be made available – \"and they don't want to use more revenue as fast as they get rid of it.\"\n\nAmong the remaining unresolved items are proposals to make a 4.25 percent property tax reduction permanent and to lower the state income tax rate from 9.75 to 8 percent. The House has approved both but the Senate has yet to pass them.\n\nState budget watchers say a new revenue stream, such as increased gas or liquor taxes, would also be a viable solution to the deficit.\n\n\"There is still $1.7 billion of unspent dollars,\" said John Cox, president of the Illinois Policy Institute, a conservative think tank. \"The first two measures are probably the least likely to be addressed by the general budget crisis. And I think the most likely solution is tax reform.\"\n\nOther possible sources of funding would include increased taxes on tobacco products, which make up a large part of the state's cigarette smoking and tobacco use rates, or additional fees, which would raise revenue in a similar fashion to what the state collects on cigarette and tobacco taxes.\n\nA possible solution for the deficit could include the state raising taxes and fees on its biggest industries, such as liquor and tobacco, or shifting revenue from other programs to support the budget.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday approved a revenue estimate from the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office that said a higher cigarette tax would raise about $140 million annually, but that the revenue would be largely offset by other tax increases. The state revenue estimate included a projected revenue loss caused by the state's sales tax rate being lowered to 2.25 percent from 9.875 percent, which would be partially offset with additional levies on beer and wine.\n\nA revenue loss from the $4 billion state surplus over the past two years, a key element of the state's budget, could potentially be replaced by spending on pension liabilities that have grown by about $7 billion in the past decade, according to the analysis.\n\nLawmakers also have discussed the possibility of using the state's $2 billion surplus to offset tax increases.\n\nThe state's largest school district, Chicago Public Schools, recently said it expects to receive about $400 million in increased education funding, up from the $375 million it received in fiscal year 2012-13.\n\nBut that would still be less than the full amount needed to close the projected annual deficit, which is projected at $3.7 billion.\n\n\"We have seen times that revenues go up before taxes go down,\" said Eric Zorn of the Illinois Policy Institute. \"My worry is we haven't seen that in three years. I have serious concerns that the deficit is going to get worse even if there is more revenue.\"\n\nRep. Robin Kelly, D-Chicago, suggested some combination of both tax increases, fee increases and new funding options.\n\n\"We can't go into a tax-cutting mode and then make decisions to cut essential services,\" said Kelly, a vocal proponent of revenue increases and a leader of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nShe said the House budget also could propose other funding options, such as increased fees from casinos or hotels.\n\n\"I don't see tax increases being the right approach,\" she said. \"You've got to find ways to address our shortfalls.\"\n\nGov. Pat Quinn wants the Legislature to tackle tax increases to close the budget gap before its next session begins in early April. But Quinn doesn't have the power to implement new taxes without legislative approval.\n\nRep. Lou Lang, D-Skokie, one of the primary advocates for tax increases to address the state's fiscal woes, said he would support such a plan.\n\n\"We were told that there would be no tax increase,\" he said. \"But it's pretty hard to argue that we don't need a tax increase just to close the hole we're in.\"\n\nIf revenue is not raised, the Illinois State Board of Education has said it may not be able to make interest payments and other required payments needed to keep schools open.\n\n\"Given these realities, there is no choice but to seek the greatest extent possible to close the current deficit. However, this will only be possible if we",
      "It is hard for someone to be a feminist when she thinks the way a man does (which, in a way, she feels she can do because she herself is a man).\n\nThat's the view of Anne Eubank, a British activist and professor who has written a blog post arguing that women are better feminists when they \"think like men.\" She's also a professor of social anthropology at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHere's the gist, which we'll translate into plain English: Women are so busy striving for power over men that they fail to \"think like men.\" In fact, thinking like a man is more likely to get you more feminist clout than thinking like a woman, because men think more and tend to make more complex evaluations of situations.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhen they make moral judgments about right and wrong, men are about 10% more likely to make a wrong judgment than women.\n\nWhen it comes to the way they interpret social norms, men and women are about the same in their interpretation (men are about 8% more likely to interpret social norms in a more negative way than women).\n\nMen are more likely to see women as \"weak\" and women are more likely to be perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nMen and women are about equal in the ways they interpret situations in terms of either \"good\" or \"bad\" outcomes.\n\nMen do less and women do more. When it comes to \"what we should do\" when an action is taken, men are more likely than women to make a judgment that \"the action is beneficial, so it's good,\" while women are more likely to suggest \"the action is harmful so it's bad.\"\n\nIt's true that there is some gender difference in the strength of their moral judgments, that they are about 10% more likely to make a wrong judgment when they think about a moral question, and that they are about 8% more likely to make a mistaken judgment about whether a moral question is beneficial or harmful. So the gender gap, at least if the study is correct, is much smaller than that, but it's also larger than the 10% and 8% estimates, and larger than the 10% estimate and the 8% estimate, respectively. It seems like an enormous gap.\n\nIt's almost inevitable that in reading about this, there will be people who disagree with Anne Eubank's theory. (Her blog post itself is a long rant — though she does a good job of showing that she actually understands the research.) The argument that feminism is a movement that focuses more on women's equality than men's equality is probably familiar to most people who pay a regular attention to feminism, but it's worth taking a look at a related thesis: That feminism, being a political movement, simply cannot be seen as a movement that works for all women. (For a good overview, see Linda Hirshman's paper.)\n\nBut I think it's worth looking at Anne Eubank's thesis from a different angle. As I've pointed out in previous posts (here, here, here), it strikes me as more and more ridiculous to say that feminism is about equal rights for women when the very nature of feminism implies that equal rights for women come with a burden of being a feminist.\n\nWhen feminists talk about feminism, they're talking about equal rights to make life decisions, not equal responsibility for making life decisions. In most cases, having two equal rights is the exact opposite of taking responsibility for making life decisions. So when Anne Eubank says that feminists should think like men, I think she's saying that feminists should start thinking less about women as equals and more about women as members of a group. Feminism is simply about women being equals, and they should have the same legal rights, and pay the same salary, and be in the same office.\n\nI'm with Anne Eubank on the first part. I think there's no better way of arguing that women aren't all equal, and it makes sense to talk as if women are only equal or rather equal to men in terms of having the same rights to make life decisions. The problem with that is the second part. Feminism, if that's what it's really about, is about women being equal members of a group, with equal responsibility for making decisions, and the way you actually express that equal responsibility is through a sense of empathy and equality with men. Not just men, but all of us, not just privileged members of our gender. The way you express that responsibility is through the notion that it's acceptable for women to be more interested in men's approval than in their own approval, a sense that women are less invested in making decisions than men. Men are to women as you might expect an insect to be to a flower: They don't make decisions because they have to, they make decisions when they like things.\n\nAnd men have a reputation for that, of making more decisions than they like, not just with respect to women but",
      "The following script is from \"Reverse Engineering A Computer Virus\" which aired on Feb. 10, 2016. Charlie Rose is the correspondent. Shachi Kurl, producer.\n\nAs we've all learned, the computer virus isn't the problem. A well-designed virus could stop the virus. It's more important to understand the technology that has made the virus possible.\n\nReverse engineering a virus is very hard because you have got to understand the code and you have no source code to work with. But one day, some sort of computer was invented and it happened to use the exact same algorithm for finding the most common password to make a website get hacked.\n\nA hacker found it. They would send out a message to the Internet, saying this site has been hacked. And then they would attack another site. Once they had gotten the source code of three or four sites, they would send out a message saying, this site, this site, this site has been hacked as well. One or two of the sites would get hacked. And the hacker would figure out what the password was.\n\nSo it's not that there's a vulnerability in the software. There are very, very few weaknesses in the software.\n\nSo what we have is a large database from which we can reverse engineer it in a matter of seconds.\n\nCharlie Rose: Can you get to it?\n\nShachi Kurl: Can you get to it? Oh, absolutely.\n\nWe've seen a few examples of the computer virus that's really complicated to reverse engineer. It's like writing your own computer, you've got to understand everything, but that complexity, it's in the algorithms that were used.\n\nCBS News\n\nReverse engineers have been able to reverse code to this degree because we can now examine hundreds of, millions of lines of code and we can examine almost any line of code that's running on a computer.\n\nCharlie Rose: How good is that tool called an open-source program called R?\n\nCBS News\n\nShachi Kurl: It's free software. It's very useful.\n\nCharlie Rose: So does it, like, actually change the code?\n\nShachi Kurl: Yes and no. There's some code that's changed.\n\nCharlie Rose: So that's a bit of an improvement.\n\nShachi Kurl: Yes and no, because it doesn't change the code itself. One of the things they did say is this virus changes how the program works.\n\nCharlie Rose: Does it change what the user sees?\n\nShachi Kurl: In theory if you try and install it there's a warning that it could break the security of the computer.\n\nCharlie Rose: You haven't been able to reverse engineer it.\n\nShachi Kurl: No, we have not been able to reverse engineer the malware. That's the problem with malware.\n\nCharlie Rose: You can't see what it does.\n\nShachi Kurl: Well, some malware, for example, is really designed so it changes the computer so that the virus changes its behavior. But we are able to see it, we can understand it, there's a very large set of malware to try and understand.\n\nCharlie Rose: And it's an incredibly huge database, that's a huge advantage over what we had before.\n\nCharlie Rose: So it's not even a race anymore? What we do now is not actually changing the programs themselves.\n\nShachi Kurl: Yes, it's a great advantage.\n\nCharlie Rose: What's the disadvantage this gives the bad guy?\n\nShachi Kurl: Well, there's a downside. And the downside is I can't tell you. You could say this guy actually has a bigger advantage than we do.\n\nCharlie Rose: We can't see it.\n\nShachi Kurl: We know that some of these kinds of software changes the behavior of the software or it breaks the security so if we look at a virus, for example, or you know, I could even make up a name for a virus. I could call it, for example, the \"Phishing Virus.\"\n\nCharlie Rose: So you can't stop it. You can't tell if it's coming down the pipe on my system.\n\nShachi Kurl: Correct. But I think it is definitely going to increase because people do realize that they've got to pay attention to who they're dealing with when they're dealing with these kinds of malware attacks.\n\nCharlie Rose: Is this really going to make all this computer hacking happen?\n\nShachi Kurl: This is definitely going to increase. And not just because of the virus, but because of the fact that we're just going to be making it easier. We're going to be taking this attack online, right? And as we do that, all these sites are",
      "It has a lovely ring to it.\n\nThe \"punch\" sound used to be considered a vulgar term. Now, thanks in part to the likes of the cast and crew of the new season of Game of Thrones (a show in which a lot of the characters say a lot of \"punching-me's\"), it has a new reputation.\n\n\"There's a great scene [in \"Eastwatch,\" a new episode of Game of Thrones] where two characters are talking about this punchline, and [Jon Snow] says to a guy, 'Did you get your sister pregnant?' And the guy says, 'No.' And Jon says, 'Well, I did,' \" says showrunner David Benioff during a preview screening of Sunday's episode.\n\nThe actor responding: \"Did you?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" says Jon.\n\nOn a show that's been hailed for its \"punching\" jokes, it's worth noting that the line originally referred to Jon's own father, Ned Stark. And Benioff, at length, notes the change in tone when the lines were re-written for \"Eastwatch.\"\n\nWhile the scene appears to be about Jon's past sexual abuse, that part was added later, he says — \"we couldn't get the timing and punchline right when we started to rewrite it.\"\n\n\"I have been really impressed with you guys, with the quality of the writing, the humor, but it is what it is,\" Jon tells the man who's about to find out what he just said to the bastard son of the King of Winterfell. To be fair, though, Benioff's line here doesn't contain the most cutting humor — it might just be the show's best use of \"punch\"-speak.\n\nBenioff's first episode on episode 3 of the new season was the one in which Cersei Lannister had a lot to say about her unborn twin sons because she was so \"upset\" (by the \"twin babies,\" in Benioff's words).\n\nNow that she and Tyrion Lannister have seen the baby, \"they're not as upset with it,\" Benioff says.\n\n\"There's a scene in the next book that's one of the most emotional scenes I've told anyone about,\" Benioff says. But for whatever reason, it hadn't really occurred to him to include it on screen.\n\n\"I've never had that scene written before,\" Benioff says.\n\nAnd so, after a couple \"oh no,\" \"I can't believe I forgot that line\" moments, it appears that \"twin babies\" will be more of the rare occurrence than they may have seemed.",

The Congress is now facing an election in three of its four northeastern assembly seats.\n\nAfter the BJP's victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party took a \"wait and watch\" approach for some time and then came out with its electoral manifesto, promising to introduce \"minimum government, maximum governance\" - the BJP's key election plank.\n\nUPC had formed a government in 2013 and subsequently resigned on March 5, 2015 when the BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi visited the state to stake his claim to power.\n\nWhile the UPC has already lost ground to the national and regional parties in the state, the victory of the BJP will be a setback for the Congress which has never enjoyed a decisive victory in the state, losing every national and state election since 1983.\n\nModi will be travelling to UP this week to mark his party's victory. On Monday, UPC Chief Keshav Prasad Maurya said the party was prepared for any form of compromise and that it was \"unpredictable\" what the Congress might do.\n\nHowever, the UPC leadership was not very optimistic when asked how it would cope with the BJP's victory if it formed a government in the state.\n\n\"We didn't get to choose whether the Congress was elected or not with the BJP. We had a coalition. We have been sitting with both Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the last 15 months. And there is no question of us compromising anything. The Congress and the BJP are different, but we are all united on the same agenda,\" said Maurya.\n\nHe dismissed the Congress's claim that Modi had failed to fulfill promises made in the manifesto to the local voters, saying the national party had no problem reaching out to its local counterparts.\n\n\"Some of the promises that were made to people in the last campaign have yet to be fulfilled. But we have to trust that Mr Narendra Modi will fulfil the promises which he made in the manifesto. If he doesn't fulfil his promises, then we have to understand where his campaign failure was.\"\n\nMaurya said the Congress might have been upset by the way the BJP had \"won\" but the UPC had nothing to worry about. The party did not have a leader present at the election meeting, he said, as it was held in the last week in August.\n\n\"We had no party leader there. What can we do about Mr Modi? He is the party chief. We didn't have any person present who could speak against Mr Narendra Modi ... I will not speak against the BJP,\" he said.\n\n\"This election was not fought on the issue of Rahul Gandhi's or Uma Bharti's (Congress vice-president and chief ministerial candidate in the state) politics or on their personalities. This election was fought on Mr Narendra Modi's leadership skills, and on a new style of campaigning and leadership,\" Maurya added.\n\nThe BJP's victory has been attributed to a widespread disappointment with the Congress, particularly under its Rahul Gandhi, that led to large-scale anti-incumbency and the exit of big-name ministers such as Suresh Prabhu and Jignesh Mewani, and led to UPC losing its stronghold in the state capital city Lucknow.\n\nModi had focused on the poll promises made by the party, including welfare for the poor and a focus on development of Gujarat.\n\nThe prime minister, who led BJP to defeat in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, campaigned for his party in the state, saying \"development is important in politics\".",
      "By: |\n\nIt's been a while since our last guest with a story, but I hope we'll have an even better one for you in a few weeks!\n\nThis week's guest is Dr. Jason Norsworthy who is an associate professor at the University of Toronto. A big part of his research is the study of genetics and intelligence. In his lab, scientists have discovered a gene related to attention and memory. Norsworthy's research has also turned up the fact that you can influence intelligence levels by having a certain diet.\n\nI first ran into Dr. Norsworthy when I was doing a podcast where I interview geneticists. We had a great conversation about his research and why, given that we understand very little about the human genome, it's good to have at least some of it understood.\n\nHis research is very interesting and he spoke with Matt about the things he's looking at.\n\nClick here to listen to the episode!\n\nHere are four things we discussed.\n\nGenes, Nutrition and Health\n\nDr. Norsworthy is particularly interested in understanding how genes influence the health of individuals.\n\nThe first thing he brought up with Matt is how we consume food affects our genes. He brought this up because it seems that even just having a certain diet can affect the health of our own DNA. As he put it:\n\nWe are not, and our genome is always evolving so it's always changing the way that we behave. If something really changes our genes it doesn't mean that we have to live the way we live until our 70s, but our genes will evolve in one way or another – probably the most radical, but sometimes the most predictable type of evolution, which is a change in our DNA. The genetic modification of our lives can be good or bad but its a change in our DNA and for some reason I think that makes so much sense.\n\nOur genes are constantly changing and influencing our lives. He explained that this research has proven that the health benefits of certain foods are mostly in the protein and carbohydrates they contain.\n\nNutrition, in turn, impacts the health of our metabolism and therefore how our bodies function. Nutrient-rich foods such as nuts, seeds and fruits are important for optimal health.\n\nCultivating a Mindful Diet\n\nI've mentioned diet before in the podcast, but Matt and I also talked about how your environment influences your genes.\n\nThere are certain environments that are more conducive to healthy living. Matt mentioned that the best climate to be healthy in is to be born in a place that has a lot of sunlight.\n\nThe other environment (which he said he had little influence on) was the environment that he grew up in with his family. This place had very clean air and very little dirt, which resulted in a healthier and more nutrient-rich diet for his kids.\n\nHe also said that the environment in the classroom matters more than the classroom itself and what type of books are available. He also mentioned that children's TV shows and commercials can have harmful effects on one's health if one watches too much of them.\n\nMatt has also taken advantage of the free time that he has by working from home. By working outside of the school day (while his kids are at school), he's given himself the time to spend with his family and to do research on the effects of different foods.\n\nThe more I think about it, there are a lot of things that we can do to be healthy in this increasingly busy world. Just like we don't need to live in a cave to live a healthy life, we don't need to live in a cave to live a healthy life. We can always find time outside of school to get healthy and I hope Matt will be doing that as well.",
      "It's been a rough week for Microsoft and Windows 10, but that's probably for the best. With a Microsoft's announcement that Cortana is finally ready to get her own Windows 10 app and a new report that the Bing virtual assistant will soon be able to use Google's search results, Microsoft seems to have gotten a much-needed break over the past couple of days.\n\nThe Windows store is still full of bad apps, including a number of paid-for Windows phone ports of third-party Android apps. It wouldn't be surprising if Microsoft's Windows 10 Store suffered a hit that will cause a temporary dip in the Windows phone market in the near future. Even if Microsoft can build on the success of Windows 10 and turn it into something that attracts a lot of users, it will be a steep hill to climb back to the top.\n\nOf course, Microsoft faces its own problems. Windows 10 could be a great thing, but it's also one that Microsoft cannot afford to completely abandon. Many have argued in the past that the Windows Phone and Windows 8 ecosystems could potentially be compatible with each other—and that might be true. If Microsoft can convince OEMs to buy Windows phones, it could potentially benefit. Plus, Microsoft can leverage that success to build its own phones.\n\nOne of the big issues, though, is that Windows is still a big part of the Windows ecosystem, and even if a Windows phone or Windows 10 phone makes money, Google might not. Google loves to point out what it calls Microsoft's \"craziest ideas.\" If Microsoft can't build a way to make its own phones or Windows 10 phones succeed, it could quickly become a second-class citizen in the Microsoft universe.\n\nMicrosoft may not have the luxury to just sit and wait forever. The fact is that Windows isn't profitable. Some of the profits have been shifted back to partners who build apps for the Windows store. However, the vast majority of Windows revenue still comes from Windows Office. So, if Microsoft wants to remain involved with that part of business, it has to make more money from it. By continuing its push to open source, its new Windows 10 Universal apps and Cortana assistant, it can help make that possible.\n\nWhile Google has become an integral part of the digital advertising industry, that's not something that Microsoft should allow to happen on Windows. It will have to come up with innovative ways to get its apps onto the Windows store, including apps that make money for both Google and Microsoft.",
      "A B-17 bomber is seen in an April 17, 1945 photo on a mission in Europe.\n\nA B-17 bomber is seen in an April 17, 1945 photo on a mission in Europe.\n\nIn 1945, at the end of World War II, the Allies were losing the air war to the Nazis. But the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, whose mission had been to determine whether the U.S. could continue to defeat the Russians, was determined to change that. The Survey, run by Gen. Leslie Groves and Rear Adm. Charles Farragut, believed the only way to defeat the Nazis was to develop a nuclear weapon and use it against them. In an article that appeared in the March 1946 issue of Popular Science, they declared, quote, \"At the present time, as we know, only four nations have atomic weapons, and most of them are developed, but not yet in combat use, against these two super powers.\" Now we're going to hear about the last of these four nations.",
      "The last time I checked, I was in the final stages of my life.\n\nAnd it appears I'm not the only one.\n\nAccording to a new study, the first baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1965) may be dying earlier than expected.\n\nThe report in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association found that those in the highest socioeconomic classes had a 38% higher risk of death from any cause compared with those in the lowest socioeconomic classes.\n\nAccording to the study:\n\nThis pattern held even when researchers considered the possibility that differences in socioeconomic status might be partially attributable to socioeconomic status's effect on health behaviors, in this case smoking.\n\nThe risk of premature death increased by 33% between age 60 and 65 for people born in the highest socioeconomic classes compared with those born in the lowest.\n\nAnd they say it's not your fault.\n\nAfter all, we are human:\n\nMany are unaware of the impact of one's socioeconomic status on health. The findings indicate that physicians can raise the socioeconomic status of patients and reduce their risk of premature death to a similar degree as if all patients were aware of the potential for the effect of socioeconomic status on health and actively engaged in managing it. These individuals, however, could still have an elevated risk of premature death — even if their socioeconomic characteristics are comparable to their peers.\n\nThey even claim that those who work in social services are less likely to die prematurely at work (so no blame there for that):\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of providing services in disadvantaged neighborhoods, which are often poor in health and home to low-income populations.\n\nAnd the same goes for those who work in law enforcement and the military.\n\nIf you think that's the end of the world, think again...\n\nSome might say it's just one more example of the \"war on men.\"\n\nThe authors of the study suggest there may be other ways to reduce this risk. For example, if we didn't have such a high level of stress, the likelihood of dying early — even through illness — may be less because it may lead to some early death.\n\nHowever, it really is depressing, to say the least:\n\nEven after accounting for socioeconomic circumstances, the risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) was only elevated by an average of 9% among high-socioeconomic-status individuals and 13% among low-socioeconomic-status individuals. Although this means that there is potential for improved health behaviors among those with high socioeconomic positions, the finding of a 9% elevated mortality risk among high-socioeconomic-status individuals underscores the importance of developing better policies and programs that could help all participants make greater health progress in the shortest possible time.\n\nOh, it's not just you:\n\nSome may wonder why we would bother with this study if there isn't a real effect. Well, if we looked only at the first-timers in the study, it would appear we might see an effect, but this group was likely to be younger, in better health, and from healthier social backgrounds than the rest. This was likely why their results were somewhat positive.\n\nWell, there's your answer. And it's depressing as hell.",
      "The \"F-35 Joint Strike Fighter\" may be on track to become the best-selling military weapon of all time. The Lockheed Martin-made aircraft is now sold to more than 60 countries around the globe, but now the Pentagon is preparing to dump a lot of those contracts, in what looks to be a major sell-off in advance of potential future military aircraft sales to Iran or China.\n\nThis time around, though, the Pentagon appears most likely to sell the contract rights, meaning the planes are now free to be resold and marketed to other nations in the future. The Defense Department told reporters at a recent conference that it did not have to buy and fly any of the aircraft to sell to other nations, though it would take a few months until it could.\n\nHere are six reasons it is likely the program may soon be on its way to being scrapped.\n\n1. The U.S. is buying too many planes. The Pentagon has repeatedly said it expected to sell 12 of the Joint Strike Fighters to its military allies, but there are now more than 60 countries with a stake in the program. That makes many officials nervous that the Pentagon is planning to continue buying jets for the F-35 that the countries don't want. The U.S. is buying more than twice as many of the plane for each ally as are projected to be purchased by Iran or China, according to an analysis by defense analysts at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"We'll be in a very poor position if we have to sell a lot more weapons to the Saudis than we need to sell just to keep the program afloat,\" the C.S.I. study estimates. \"So any attempt to keep the program around the same number as previous plans will end in disaster. … The program will no longer make economic sense.\"\n\n2. The jet will soon be fully operational. The F-35 program has been plagued by cost overruns and delays, and the aircraft is still years away from being fully operational. That, in turn, has made the program more expensive and less reliable, a concern for military and aerospace companies. The program's development costs are estimated to cost at least $1.5 trillion over its 50-year lifespan, and it will need at least $1.5 trillion to refurbish the aircraft when it goes back to the commercial market, according to the Pentagon. The Air Force and Lockheed Martin have already sunk up to $25 billion into the F-35 program in the hope it will become the new standard for combat aircraft. Those costs alone could outweigh the profit that the Defense Department can generate from the planes, which the company is selling at prices it says match off-the-shelf ones.\n\n3. The U.S. can't be sure which of its allies want it. The U.S. has agreed to the F-35 deal with its 12 partners in the project, including Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Canada, Italy, Japan and Turkey. The U.S. is not allowed to sell the airplanes to allies who don't buy them and those countries must sign on to participate with the Pentagon. Russia and China are among the six nations that aren't expected to buy the planes because of concerns that the jets could be used for offensive purposes, according to analysts at the C.S.I. conference. \"One reason the program was originally designed as a 'buy-any-country-anytime' program was to reduce the chance that allies might be tempted to pursue their own defense programs, or even refuse any F-35 purchases,\" says a study by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. But that has had a serious impact on the entire program, because every fighter jet in the program is being built in the United States. Now, many of those countries want to participate in the program, but don't necessarily want U.S. weapons. So the U.S. now needs to sell those planes to them directly or hope the countries can decide whether to buy the jets or keep them out of their own arsenals.\n\n4. The countries most interested in buying the jets are not the ones most likely to use them to attack their enemies. The U.S. has a lot at stake in the Joint Strike Fighter program because, without it, its allies would be less equipped to combat future threats. But just as with so many other parts of the military, buying it has made those partners less capable of defending themselves and has meant that the U.S. has less chance to deter potential enemies from becoming them. The C.S.I. report estimates that the countries most likely to buy the F-35s are the countries most likely to become enemies in the near future, including China and Russia. In all, there are nine of those countries, including Israel, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Britain, where the Pentagon has agreed that the Pentagon will provide an unspecified number of the F-35s once",

      "Hamas is refusing to let the World Bank take control of a port which it has been controlling for the past 20 days, Al Jazeera English's Iraj Abed reports.\n\nLast week, Palestinian news agency Ma'an reports that Hamas officials and the armed wing's military wing had reached agreement on an alternative plan that would have the port \"return to Palestinian control within 48 hours\".\n\nThe Port of Ashdod in northern Gaza is run by the Palestinian Authority. Hamas has control of it, and the port serves as a major entry and exit point for smuggling goods from Egypt into Gaza.\n\nOn 26 August, the Israeli army announced it was beginning to blockade the crossing from Gaza into Egypt. From then on, the port was closed, and Hamas has been forced to turn it over to the Palestinian Authority.\n\nDespite this, the port's manager, Mahmoud Zahar, has continued to reject all attempts by the World Bank officials to take over the port. He told Ma'an: \"Hamas is concerned about the interests of the Gaza Strip, which is a land subject to the sovereignty of Palestine, and the port should not be used to carry out exports.\"\n\nThe port's owners want Israel to leave Gaza, and so it is unlikely that Hamas will agree to a return to full control at this stage.\n\nAbed said that Hamas has been trying to avoid conflict with the Palestinian Authority in order to keep the port open.\n\nThe fact that he is unwilling to part with it could be interpreted as a tacit agreement to an Israeli blockade. Hamas may have decided \"to avoid a clash with the Palestinian Authority, and they have opted to go ahead with the Israeli siege with an iron fist\", Abed said.\n\nIn the past, Hamas has refused entry to both Israeli and Egyptian ships, and has had to be told to open the port by an Israeli military representative.\n\nIt has been possible to smuggle in other goods through the port, but not all of them.\n\nGaza was bombed by Israel for six days last week as it battled Palestinian factions who had captured a checkpoint north of Khan Younis. Israeli air strikes were part of an operation called Pillar of Defence aimed at restoring security and stopping the militants' rockets from reaching southern Israel.\n\nHamas was reportedly considering \"a comprehensive response\" to Israel's operations.",

      "I don't know where to begin. We're going to take a look at the best and worst players in the league this year based on offensive production and play-by-play. And this is just like the best team award we've ever done, right? Like the MVP!\n\nWell, there's your preamble, and now let's roll!\n\nPlayoff team: The Texans. Houston had one of four 10-win teams, which is a bit of a stretch since they're 5-7, but that's what I'm going to do. This team was led by one of the best two players we've ever seen in Alfred Blue, who played on a team that had the NFL's third-best pass defense last year and the No. 1 run defense. Blue was absolutely dominant; he finished 12th in the NFL in QB rating and had the only 60-touchdown season for a rookie in NFL history. (I know, crazy, right?) That guy is special, and even though he missed 11 games, the Texans still managed to go 9-7. They even beat the Patriots in the AFC South.\n\nWe want to know who has been better, with defensive end JJ Watt topping this article. Watt had his moments, of course, but he's not getting the respect he deserves on the defensive line from me right now.\n\nBest offensive player: RB Lamar Miller. Miller played every snap on offense, which is amazing considering how he tore his ACL in the preseason. And he averaged just over 4 yards per carry. What is to like about this performance? All the little stuff, like he's tough to tackle, can't be taught, he runs hard, and he has a very good arm.\n\nThe most impressive part: The team was 11-2 despite his injury. And the Texans' pass defense was just as good with Miller in the lineup, giving up just 18.0 points per game, which is tops in the league.\n\nWorst offensive player: WR DeAndre Hopkins, WR Miles Austin, DE Mario Williams and LB Brian Cushing. I know you think I'm crazy saying a team with the top pass defense and one of the best running backs in the NFL won 11 games with one of the worst pass-catching teams ever, but the Texans are going to do that, too. Houston played one of the worst offenses in the league last year, and it won 11 games.\n\nHopkins had a terrific season, finishing 15th in fantasy points among wide receivers. He'll likely finish outside the top five, but what can I say? People are excited about Hopkins. He should be one of the best WR1s in fantasy this year, even at the age of 25.\n\nBiggest surprise: WR DeAndre Hopkins. Last year was pretty much Hopkins' last hurrah. The big reason he came in as a top wide receiver coming into the 2013 season? Because DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nWell, this year is a different story. In fact, Hopkins is having one of the better seasons of his career. The biggest surprise? If you look at the numbers, he actually finished at least 11th in fantasy points among wide receivers this year in only 11 games. Even though his catch rate is only 57 percent, he's still getting his share of targets, though he's not getting the attention of other players.\n\nWilliams is coming back from off-the-field issues and should be able to help this offense to at least 10 wins. But Austin is likely going to be suspended for the first six games of the year, which means there's not a whole lot of room on the depth chart.\n\nBest coach: Mike Bajakian. I know, I know, it's another team with the best pass defense in football. But even though I think the 49ers won a game due to turnovers, I can say for sure that Bajakian has a good one this year. He's been a great motivator for his players and has shown that he cares about getting his team to play hard for him.\n\nWorst coach: Dennis Allen. The Raiders had one of the worst defenses in the NFL last year and their coach just isn't very good. If I had to guess, I'd say that Allen is not in trouble yet, but Oakland's offense will likely be the laughingstock of the next decade. Allen doesn't really seem to understand play-calling -- at every game this season we've been reminded that he hasn't called a pass on the first drive of the game! -- so expect a change this year. Plus, Oakland ranked No. 3 in passing yards per game last year.\n\nBest rookie: WR Amari Cooper. I don't want to sound like a homer here, but it's hard to argue with what Cooper did in Year 1. Cooper had 70 receptions in Year 1. That's incredible, considering that the Raiders only needed to go 18-17. And in the final five",
      "This will save us from an even bigger scandal!\n\nThe \"tapegate\" video scandal involves members of Congress and their aides making inappropriate sexual remarks toward a young staffer during a Congressional Black Caucus event. The tape, which was leaked to the Washington Post, was intended to embarrass the members and their aides in an effort to punish them. The staffers were supposed to be disciplined, but instead they were praised by some and excoriated by others. We saw nothing but hypocrisy, not one bit of \"I'm sorry\" for the aides who made these comments.\n\nBut the big scandal comes from the fact that members of Congress are still doing it.\n\nThe American people are disgusted to the core with this, so they just have to start demanding that more be done about it. The Democrats need to realize that voters are becoming tired of this behavior. As the American people have become more educated and savvy as to what is wrong with their country, we've started to reject this behavior and vote for candidates who will support our interests.\n\nThe problem with this entire situation is that you can't talk about the situation fairly. You either want to be in favor of it and you don't think the members would have done this if they didn't know they were doing wrong, or you don't. It's a really tricky situation, but it can be resolved.\n\nThe American people want us to act like grown ups. If Democrats were to become more involved in the investigation and if we start looking at the real issue here that this was an attempt to humiliate the staff, to retaliate for their success, we can really take a look at this situation differently.",
      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Police arrested five people for the gang rape at a bar in Delhi\n\nFive men have been arrested over the gang rape of a woman in central Delhi last month.\n\nThe attack happened as the 21-year-old was waiting for a bus, and witnesses said they heard the man shouting as he raped her. The case has sparked widespread public anger over the treatment of women in India. She died of her injuries in hospital.\n\nA total of 16 people have been arrested in connection with the attack, including the bus conductor and two of the five men.\n\nThe victim's family have appealed for the men to be handed the death penalty.\n\nInspector General of Police V.K. Singh told reporters that they were arrested after DNA samples from four men were also found at the crime scene.\n\nHe said they will undergo tests to establish whether they are the suspects already named by police.\n\nThe woman - named as the rape victim by police - was returning home on the evening of 28 December after meeting friends at a bus stand.\n\nWitnesses say she was then dragged inside the bus and brutally assaulted by five men for more than an hour.\n\nShe later died in hospital.\n\nThe case sparked widespread public anger over the treatment of women in India and the murder of a student, Jyoti Singh, in Delhi in similar circumstances last February.\n\nAnalysis: Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi\n\nIndia's controversial rape law is one reason why the victim's family is campaigning to have her attackers hanged.\n\nThey say they are not demanding for the death penalty, merely they want the court to ensure a trial in the best possible public interest, regardless of what punishment can be meted out to those found guilty.\n\nBut the law is still in force and has been invoked by courts more than once.\n\nThere have been convictions under the law and it's fair to say the death penalty is not guaranteed.\n\nThe state has a very heavy responsibility in the conduct of a trial of this kind. The case has come to light not because the state allowed it, but because it was prevented. So it is up to the state to act to ensure justice in cases of rape.\n\nThe law was passed in 2002 and it has been a tough ride. There are concerns that it is not being applied fairly - one of the most recent deaths was of a child accused of rape.\n\nBut with the state's encouragement, there have been more convictions and convictions.\n\nIt's up to the government to change attitudes, says the victim's lawyer Raju Mehta.\n\n\"The death penalty is not an absolute, it's punishment by the court, it has to be in addition to the other punishments that the court provides in cases like this. It has to look at the totality. For example, if a person is found to be liable by the law of the land, in a case like this, but is acquitted on appeal, then should the court have a death sentence imposed?\" he asked.\n\nRead more on the case here.\n\nThe victim's family has also appealed for the arrest of those responsible for the rape and for their case to be moved to the lower courts.\n\nThe police also released CCTV images of the bus driver and four other men at a bar in Delhi on Saturday.\n\nThe footage showed the bus driver approaching the bus at about 15:00 and leaving shortly after.\n\nMr Singh says he hopes the men will be identified and dealt with at the earliest moment.",
      "Bruno Bettelheim's influential theory of human nature came to be known as the \"Homo heuristic\" or \"Homo heuristic hypothesis,\" named after the English historian of science, Bernard Hutton (1834–1906). This theory describes the human brain as a heuristic agent capable of generalizing and making inferences based on past experience, and thus an \"adaptation\" to environmental and social structures. It has been tested in a variety of ways and has been proven to be applicable to a range of situations.\n\nBettelheim, a German Jewish intellectual at the University of Frankfurt, was born in 1883 in Tübingen. A lifelong student of psychology in which he became an expert in the age-old question of human morality, he wrote and published over 120 works before his death. When his first book was published in 1930, his influence extended through the sciences of psychology, anthropology and sociology.\n\nHis theories were originally developed as a result of his own research into human behavior. He noticed that human beings were generally willing to believe that all groups, no matter how diverse, shared certain underlying characteristics. The common denominator he found among most groups he studied was the fact that the leaders and most respected members of a group displayed traits that were similar to those found in our own species. This finding led him to speculate that one could extrapolate human characteristics to other species. For example, if one looked at the behavior of lions and gazelles, and compared their actions to the actions of humans, one would find similarities to human behavior.\n\nDuring the early part of his career, he was not able to use his methods in his studies with animals because of the fact that only the most educated and elite individuals were interested in such work. Therefore he continued to study the lives of humans without employing his animal study methods until he published his classic book on human nature in 1955 titled The Managed Will. In it, he argued that the individual is capable of acting as long as there is a will to be acted upon. He noted that there were many instances of people who were unable to achieve the results in life that they wanted, but who nevertheless acted accordingly and overcame these obstacles and lived a happier life. It was also this study which led him to believe that humans did not necessarily have free will.\n\nIn addition to his theory, he developed the concept of the \"homo heuristic\" in a series of articles (The Sociology of the Will, The Sociology of the Will, The Sociology of the Will, The Sociology of the Will). In his most famous work, The Sociology of the Will (1945), he concluded that all humans could not be described as rational or intelligent because all of the factors and decisions related to living one's life, from the most trivial to the most important, were influenced and made at will by the other human beings in the group. Instead of giving each person a chance and explaining the reasoning behind what he/she was doing, he gave a list of the various influences and the reasons for them. He gave examples, but did not try to prove which factors and reasons were real and which, as mere \"cultural constructs\" could be discarded so quickly if they were found to \"not make sense.\" This method was later known as the \"homo heuristic hypothesis.\"\n\nBettelheim's work was criticized for several reasons (most notably by two Jewish intellectuals, the psychologists and anthropologists Erich Fromm and Max Horkheimer), but the basic idea was never refuted. To make these discoveries, his analysis and explanation of the human species had to be tested by numerous human cultures in order to see if similar experiences or conclusions could be extrapolated to other species.\n\nThe Human Species as a Social Species\n\nBettelheim's human species theory was never accepted by most academics, and in the 1950s, he was largely ignored. However, it wasn't because of any lack of evidence or facts supporting the hypothesis. Many of his studies, such as comparing human and animal behavior during warfare and genocide or even considering the effects of political oppression on the psychology of the human species, were well-researched and supported by the data.\n\nWhile his critics argued that his theories were too simplistic, his success with his theories could be seen by the number of successful projects he took on over the decades. He even developed a method of analyzing animal behavior that became a cornerstone that has been used by scientists in numerous fields.\n\nIn the 1950s, he also started writing a series of articles about human behavior. These articles became popular and often referred to each other in reference books during the middle of the 20th century. The results he used in these works could be seen to be the result of his observations and knowledge, not a \"myth.\" The book The Social Organization of Behavior (1954) is a classic work on human development and behavior which shows how important social factors are to human development and that people learn how to behave based on the",
      "The US government has recently been engaged in a bit of censorship of its own. According to a statement published by the US Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (OCRCL), the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has removed an image of Hillary Clinton from the US Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Instagram account. The image, titled \"HILLARY, WE NEED TO FIND YOU,\" is of former US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, with a message suggesting a hashtag: #HillaryForPrison. After receiving a request from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) investigated the Instagram account and found to be in violation of an obscure Congressional rule.\n\nAccording to the OCE in its report, the agency has violated Rule 41 of the House of Representatives Rules of the House, a provision of the US Code that prohibits the removal or defacing of any member's official portrait on the House grounds. The agency's official Instagram account was later blocked from public views, but the OCE found no evidence of defacement.\n\nWhile the OCE did not make a final determination on the matter, its report cited the Instagram account, its removal, and its subsequent posting to a non-government YouTube channel as evidence of violations under the rules. The watchdog further concluded that the agency was in violation of Rule 41's requirements to investigate its alleged violations in a timely fashion.\n\nAccording to the OCE, the account was removed from the DEA's official feed on February 2, 2015, and subsequent Instagram feed postings were directed to a non-government video channel.\n\nThe removal of Hillary Clinton from the DEA's Instagram account comes in the midst of increased media attention surrounding the former State Department Secretary. On January 22, the New York Times published an op-ed by Michael Isikoff, titled \"Why I'll Support Hillary Clinton Over Donald Trump.\" Isikoff wrote that Clinton did \"good work\" in the private sector but that she is \"not suited to the high demands of the public service.\" In his op-ed, Isikoff compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini in a similar way. Isikoff concludes by claiming that Hillary Clinton's policy positions will benefit \"people like Putin, Kim Jong Un and Kim Davis.\" Both Isikoff and Cummings have been vocal supporters of Clinton in the media.\n\nCummings' letter to the OCE notes that the Instagram account was posted by a state or local law enforcement agency, indicating that the action was intended to prevent public dissemination of official DEA imagery, not for the purposes of political speech. Cummings wrote that they are \"confident\" that the OCE will uphold its initial findings and will not take further action in regard to this matter.\n\nThe DEA has yet to release a statement on the matter.\n\nSee also:\n\nDEA Sends Email Confirming Use of Social Media for Official Business",
      "The World is Watching: Inside Syria's Civil War\n\nIf there's one thing the world can learn by watching Syria, it's that the United States and its allies are no longer capable of doing anything by themselves in the name of fighting terrorist groups. While the American public doesn't seem to have much sympathy for such a scenario, a war in Syria is only going to last as long as the international community allows it to and as long as the United States continues to support the rebels there.\n\nThat's probably why the United States' latest move on Syria looks like an attempt at taking on ISIS from the ground. The American Air Force is launching air strikes over Iraq in an attempt to help the Kurds defend their self-titled capital, Erbil, from ISIS. This is the first time the United States has targeted ISIS in Iraq in several years, and it's a serious escalation against the militants.\n\nSince 2011, ISIS has expanded to most of Iraq and Syria. The group, which calls itself the Islamic State, has seized swathes of land throughout the region. It's no surprise then that the United States would see a group such as ISIS that it once fought as a threat to its interests. The Americans certainly don't want ISIS taking control of the region because they believe that the territory the militants control is ripe for the harvesting of natural resources.\n\nBut while the United States will no longer be the sole superpower in the Middle East, it will most certainly be the world's preeminent military power. This is why it's more important than ever that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, be defeated.\n\nWhy U.S. Strikes Against the Islamic State are a Bad Idea\n\nThe United States is making a lot of enemies in Iraq and Syria right now, but it's also making a lot of enemies within Syria. ISIS has managed to establish a caliphate inside Syria and control large parts of the country. This is a significant threat for the government of President Bashar al-Assad because it has given the militants more power to wage war against the Syrian government. For Assad, the Islamic State is a major hurdle in the way. Even if his government is ultimately forced to take part in any peace talks, the Islamic State will still be a threat.\n\nWhile the United States is busy taking on ISIS from the air, Syria is still plagued with sectarian violence. Assad, the country's president, has a lot blood on his hands, but it's the Islamic State and its followers, including the Nusra Front, that should be the primary target of any future U.S. strikes.\n\nNusrah Front is the al Qaeda offshoot in Syria. It is made up of former members of al Qaeda's core leadership and its former leader, Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani, was an important figure in al Qaeda's military wing. According to CIA estimates, Nusrah has as many as 8,000 fighters in Syria. It has also established itself as al Qaeda's largest affiliate after the death of al Qaeda's second in command, Ayman al Zawahiri.\n\nThe United States should be focusing on fighting al Qaeda's affiliates in Libya, Pakistan, and Yemen. These groups are far more capable of waging war against the United States than ISIS and have a better chance of stopping any U.S.-backed military operation in Syria than the Islamic State.\n\nIt's possible that the United States has not wanted to intervene against the al Qaeda branches because of the risks involved. In order to topple ISIS, U.S. forces would need to be able to defeat those groups. This would include capturing al-Jawlani and the other leaders of ISIS, and they're in hiding in Syria. While U.S. intelligence sources have long suggested that these groups will pose a significant threat to the United States, this has yet to be proven.\n\nA New ISIS Threat?\n\nBut despite the risks, the United States is going to start doing something it's never done before. It's going to bomb ISIS.\n\nFor months, a growing number of senior American officials have been warning Syria that their government was in danger of being taken over by the Islamic State. The country's government took several steps to try and prevent that from happening. For example, it tried to cut ties with al Qaeda, one of the biggest threats confronting it, and tried to expel foreign fighters from their territory. Those plans have been temporarily undermined by the United States, but it's unclear if these threats will be enough to stop the Islamic State.\n\nThe United States is not trying to take on an al Qaeda affiliate that was in power for years. It's doing it because the United States is trying to prevent the spread of the Islamic State to its territory. Now it's not trying to take out the Islamic State, it's trying to help the Kurds take it down.\n\nThe Kurds can afford to try out new fighting formations if needed. In the past, they have tried out a variety of",

      "SOUTHAMPTON – With the City Council still working on the details for its future revenue stream, some public safety agencies and leaders have suggested the idea of a new revenue stream, like an extra tax on cigarettes, as a way to help address the city's $2.2 billion budget gap.\n\nCity Council will have to vote on whether to raise additional taxes or fees to fund the police department and library, or possibly even the entire budget. Council members said Friday it will be a tough debate and have a lot riding on people having the \"right idea\" for where the additional funds will go.\n\nCouncilors are split on whether an additional tax on cigarettes might be the right choice.\n\nWhile some want a new revenue source, those who have suggested it include City Administrator Rick Bell and Chief Steven Mauriello.\n\n\"I don't think anyone is suggesting just to use the cigarette tax,\" Bell said. \"But I think we could bring in more revenue, I think we could make sure funding in the school district and in the city budget is better and make sure that the revenue stream is available.\"\n\nMauriello said it's a \"legitimate question,\" and that he's happy for the public to come up with suggestions. But he said he wants more study on the idea before he would make a decision.\n\n\"We have a budget crisis in this city and I don't think we are going to make it if we just jump into any ideas,\" Mauriello said, adding that the public should be in the \"loop\" about what direction the council would take.\n\n\"We want to make sure we listen and have the right idea of where the votes are going to come from, because we are going to be making significant decisions for a long time to come on a variety of matters,\" Mauriello said. \"But as we go along and as we look at various options and the right ones, as we make those decisions, you always want to know where the votes are going to come from.\"\n\nBell acknowledged that a tobacco tax could potentially raise extra revenue to the city, but added a tax won't be enough.\n\n\"If someone would suggest they are willing to add a cigarette tax to help us make some of the budget cuts, I would be supportive because a tax is a tax. But the fact of the matter is, there is a lot of different alternatives,\" Bell said.\n\nThe $1.65-per-pack tax is currently collected by the city's 4-cents-per-pack tax. For every pack of 18 cigarettes, $1.66 of tax goes to the city. Bell suggested the same model could be used on other tobacco products and the added revenue could help fund the city's police force and library.\n\n\"If it is an alternative, it is an important alternative,\" Councilman William Hightower said. \"I can get behind that.\"\n\nCouncil member David Greenfield agreed with the notion, though he thinks it might be better served by putting money toward the city's debt.\n\n\"It gives you a better revenue stream in terms of how that is allocated,\" Greenfield said.",
      "LIFE IN THE WALT DISNEY UNIVERSE\n\nBY JON SWETTMAN\n\nWalt Disney Studios was a very big deal for the 1950s – a dream born of the creative dreams of its first-generation founder and its biggest-ever star. As a boy, Walt Disney dreamed up the most magical of all Disney fairy tales: a children's tale about three dwarfs, a dragon, and some treasure to keep them safe.\n\nIt was this dream – that eventually resulted in Disneyland – that transformed Walt Disney from an eccentric millionaire into perhaps the most famous businessman of all time. And while Disney's work at the studio may have been far from his most celebrated achievement, his influence will never be overstated. It is his work with this small studio that brought him his first true fame. As this book shows, the Disney empire may well well have been built on an idea that only Walt Disney could have conceived of.\n\nThe Walt Disney Dream was both a tribute to and indictment of modern America. As a child in the 1950s, Walt Disney had witnessed the rise of his own country. As the son of immigrant parents who had migrated from southern Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, he had a strong sense of cultural pride. His father had been the leading voice for the American folk music movement after World War I. Their lives had been marked by a series of political and cultural upheavals, but Walt Disney was not an outlier. When he was born in 1912, America was recovering from the Great Depression, a time when its ideals of individualism, capitalism, and democracy still held some appeal. The United States was still fighting a hard battle with itself over racial segregation.\n\nBut unlike his compatriots, Walt never forgot his first encounter with this \"country of my birth.\" In a letter from the 1950s, Disney wrote, \"You can feel the great spirit of the country surging through all things, even in the smallest things…\" Walt believed that America was a symbol of universal truth, even in the tiny decisions, small moments, and small deeds that marked his life.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, Disney wanted to tell new tales that spoke to American dreams – stories that reflected a sense of hope for a brighter future. In a series of letters to a friend, Walt envisioned a movie that could do this. \"In fact, what the Disney company must produce,\" he wrote, \"is a movie that will make a lot of kids want to come to Disney…The American Dream is the world's greatest hope and I want to create one.\" In that same letter, and throughout his letters to confidant Robert Frost, Walt expressed his belief in the American ideal of the individual. For Disney, that individual represented the promise of an open-spaced, creative society.\n\nThese are just a few of the dreams that drove Walt Disney to create stories. And if these dreams did indeed exist, he would not have been the first individual to see them in his daily life.\n\nIt's ironic that Walt Disney's dream of creating a global entertainment empire was built on a project he thought would give him an epiphany of the American Dream. Just a year after his birth, Walt Disney made an unprecedented visit to Hollywood, where he worked at his mother's studio for only an interim period as he pursued his dream – one of dreams that was never realized. Walt Disney was able to make these dream come true because of some people whose lives he touched while working for his dream.\n\nThe idea of a global entertainment empire had been in the Disney minds for over forty years. Walt dreamed of a company that was capable of doing great things; he did not dream that it would be his empire. From his very first meeting with Harry Lassiter, chief executive of Warner Brothers – who soon became his lifelong ally – Walt got an almost immediate sense that his goal had much more in common with Lassiter's idea of creating \"magic\" than it did with his own dream of making \"great\" films for \"stupid people.\" It would be Lassiter's notion of \"magic\" that would be responsible for the lasting impact that Walt Disney would make on the entertainment industry.\n\nWalt had always harbored a special affection for Warner Brothers, having been a devoted fan of their own animated films. In the meantime, Lassiter had acquired an interest in films he had directed, particularly those of Charlie Chaplin; Chaplin himself had first come to Lassiter's attention when a young animator asked for direction from a veteran director. Lassiter's work for Universal Pictures also gave him an opportunity to meet the greatest of American directors, silent-era master silent screenwriter Victor Fleming. It turned out that Fleming had been a huge fan of Disney, and once Lassiter saw his own works of Fleming-Walt Disney, he realized the two shared the same love of entertainment and the same desire to make the best possible movies – both for children and for adults.\n\nAs",
      "A new documentary, \"The Man from Jekyll Island,\" delves into the true origins and fate of the notorious Jekyll Island prison in Georgia.\n\nThe new film, narrated by Academy Award-nominated actor John Cusack, makes the most of the opportunity to see and hear in the first-person accounts of former prisoners and their families.\n\nThe Jekyll Island prison, located 50 miles southeast of Savannah, Georgia, was known for its \"dreadnaught\" prison labor system, where inmates worked on ships and building projects.\n\nOne of the most infamous and controversial inmates in America's prisons during the 1980s and 1990s was Andrew \"Duke\" Stone, the former inmate and alleged leader of the cult.\n\nThe former \"Duke\" also had a large home in the island's hills, where he was seen riding a pony and making the most of his time away from society.\n\nStone died in prison in 1994, having never been convicted of a crime.\n\nIn the film, actor Cusack, who was himself imprisoned for a drug offense, speaks at length about his experience as a prisoner.\n\nThe film opens to a voiceover from Cusack, explaining the inspiration for the documentary.\n\n\"I wanted to make a film that brought back the memories of my time behind bars. It was a time that almost seemed like an eternity because there was nothing out in front of me that gave out meaning, or even interest,\" he tells a journalist from a prison cell.\n\nThe film begins with excerpts from Cusack's testimony from the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary from 1997 and 2002, along with the testimonies of various other inmates.\n\nIt was in the years after his arrival to Jekyll Island, Cusack states, when he experienced a spiritual epiphany.\n\n\"I had been a very devout Catholic, but my faith had been so wrapped up in Jesus, and my fear of death, that I had become a Buddhist,\" he tells the committee.\n\n\"It's only when I was incarcerated that I realized that all the words and all the faith I had been able to give the world about Jesus were, in turn, all this was not about. The whole thing about suffering and death just made no sense or were untrue.\"\n\nHis belief that the concept of life is an illusion was not uncommon among prisoners.\n\n\"The concept of death had completely disappeared in our prison,\" he tells the committee.\n\n\"I'd heard that in other places, that death was something to be feared, but here in Georgia it was something that came with the price of suffering every day.\n\n\"If you were a Muslim inmate in Georgia, your job was to clean prison toilets, and if you're a white inmate, it was the job of the cook and the porter to clean prison toilets.\n\n\"Your religion was not of any import here. It wasn't even relevant.\"\n\nIn the film, Cusack shows the committee photos of his former cell in the island's \"kettle.\"\n\n\"It's not what people picture when they dream of a prison cell,\" he tells the committee. \"I had a cell that had some real art on it. You know, the things you'd see in an art gallery, the paintings that your grandmother would have hung in the home.\"\n\nThe cell was on the first floor. Cisterns were at an adjacent part of the cell, and the walls, ceiling and floor were covered with paintings.\n\nInmates would use the toilet and bathe in there.\n\n\"I'd be sleeping, and I'd hear a bird chirping,\" says Cusack. \"So I'd go to investigate, and it was a bird, that's for sure.\"\n\nThe \"bird\" the actor refers to might have been the parrot he kept in prison in Georgia.\n\nThe camera then pans to one cell where the lights are dimmed.\n\n\"They had a system where you'd see the lights going up and down during the night,\" he says. \"They said some things might be scary if it was really dark and they'd turn the lights up.\"\n\n\"I think it was all related to the fact that a lot of times that night, if it's too dark on the island, there'd be guards on the bridge looking for people in need.\n\n\"It was only after I'd spent a couple of years on the island that I came to realize, well okay, maybe this whole jail house is for bad people, and in fact all there is, in jail, is a prison.\"\n\nThe film then returns to the courtroom, where Cusack and his defense attorneys argue that his sentence at Jekyll Island is more like \"life without parole,\" rather than death.\n\nBut the government disagrees, using the so-called statutory \"three strikes\" law, which",
      "This post has been updated.\n\nThis week, the House of Representatives passed an amendment by an overwhelming margin, 234 to 188, to repeal the Internet Tax Freedom Act, in hopes that will give Congress the power to roll back Net Neutrality rules enacted in 2015. But if you're among the 15-plus percent of Americans who live in a state with net neutrality law, don't fret. Congress needs to pass a bipartisan bill to fix these terrible rules, too.\n\nSo why the concern about repealing the Net Neutrality rules? Because, as the bill would have, a state could not pass anything comparable to Title II to enact new regulations. The FCC is trying to rewrite the rules in what is sometimes called Title II 2.0 in order to give broadband providers even more power to discriminate against users. \"If we do that, and allow ISPs to discriminate under Title II, it creates a two-tiered Internet,\" says Evan Greer, campaign director at Fight for the Future and a vocal opponent of the FCC's rollback of net neutrality rules.\n\nTitle II rules prevent companies from creating so-called Internet fast lanes for companies with bigger wallets. That's why net neutrality advocates have made the case against Title II, which was first established back in the 1930s to prevent the \"unfair and oppressive\" practices of companies such as AT&T. But this is what net neutrality means: Net neutrality gives everyone in the Internet the same freedom. It gives Internet service providers, like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T, the right to charge people more for faster access or use a speed-limiting throttling scheme to slow websites.\n\n\"It goes to the heart of Internet freedom and fairness.\"\n\n\"The FCC is not trying to protect the open Internet,\" says Greer. \"But it is trying to protect a few giant companies that want to be able to give some companies preferential treatment over others.\"\n\nEven though Congress is unlikely to pass legislation to restore Net Neutrality, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has been trying to undo the rules and restore an Internet environment closer to a monopoly — with only a handful of companies providing Internet service — by taking a shortcut to the Title II mechanism. Pai claims that the FCC needs to \"restore the light-touch, common-carrier authority\" that has served the public so well for more than two decades.\n\nDespite Congress's vote this week, it is far from obvious that this amendment has a chance of becoming law. After some lobbying from a small group of companies that want to have an Internet that is not \"open and free,\" the amendment failed to meet 60 votes, a threshold for passage, in the Senate — but a larger number of Republican senators are threatening to filibuster a bill to repeal Title II.\n\nSome people argue that a bill to reinstate Net Neutrality is still a \"good idea,\" but it has to be a bill about protecting Internet users from ISPs and not about allowing ISPs some power to discriminate, such as using Title II to implement a two-tiered Internet. And while Title II would be a \"step in the right direction\" for protecting net neutrality, advocates say there have been no public hearings on whether repealing the rules is good for consumers. It remains to be seen what impact repealing Net Neutrality might have on a service like Netflix, which is a big beneficiary of Net Neutrality. \"That's the real fear: What's going to happen to the Internet,\" says Greer.\n\n\"A lot of the ISPs are saying, 'Well, what's the big deal? They were going to charge me anyway anyway because I didn't have to buy all these wires, so why not pay me money?'\"\n\nAs for the House's proposed resolution to repeal Title II, Rep. Anna Eshoo, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, says it's unlikely the bill will pass. \"What we have seen from the House is that there's a wide variety of interests among members of the House who say they have concerns about net neutrality, but many of them want to see Title II preserved in order to do that.\"\n\nGreer disagrees: \"As long as we're stuck with Title II, the idea of Net Neutrality will be completely undercut,\" she says. \"It goes to the heart of Internet freedom and fairness. There's no way it's going to stop that. It's too late now to come up with the legislation to fix this.\"\n\nCongress is a little bit late in the game when it comes to addressing a growing issue on the internet. And it really needs to keep its promise to repeal net neutrality before it's too late — because there's a real chance we won't be able to keep the Internet a fair place after it gets rolled back.",

      "By: Brian Mangan\n\n@BrianMangan\n\nWhen it comes to the New York Yankees' trade deadline, it's never been a year like this.\n\nTwo years ago, the Yankees were one game away from the World Series. This year the Yankees enter the final year of the old Yankee Stadium's lease and are six games out of first place, sitting tied for eighth, and are eight games out of a wild card.\n\nThis isn't the team that won 102 games, went to the ALCS for the first time since 2001, and in just their fifth season of sustained success, won the World Series. In fact, the Yankees went 2-14 at one point on the wild card weekend of the 2013 season.\n\nWhen it comes to the team's expectations, it's impossible to know where it's been throughout the last four years.\n\nSince the turn of the century, the Yankees have always had a difficult time putting together a consistent winning season. The same goes for the team's performance through a series of coaching changes over the years as well as a few off-the-field incidents, like the infamous Bucky Dent home run and the subsequent brawl.\n\nWhile the New York Yankees did make the playoffs in 2006, they still managed to miss the playoffs over the last seven years. In 2014, the Yankees were on a hot streak, but were swept out of the playoffs by the Detroit Tigers and they haven't been back to the playoffs since.\n\nIf you don't know any better than me, you might be led to believe that the team has been the same since that fateful day in October 2010.\n\nThis belief is based on the perception that after the team went from 94 wins in 2009 (most the team has ever accomplished) to 95 in 2010, the next three years have been pretty much exactly what they were before the 2010 season.\n\nIn fact, the Yankees' run differential last season was minus-25. That means in 2013 alone, the Yankees went 21-41 when they were losing games. That number would be even worse in 2014, if not worse still in 2015.\n\nWhat the Yankees haven't made a dent in the standings in the last four seasons is their winning percentage of .480 or better, even though their goal is to win 85 games.\n\nSo, you ask, was the 2015 Yankees better than last year, even with all the injuries and an underwhelming team?\n\nThe answer for you is no. But, to me, it sounds like they're closer to being a .500 team than they are to being an 80-win team.\n\nSo, why are they trading away prospects and prospects for prospects?\n\nWell, you could point to the injuries as a reason at every point, but I think this is more of a personnel problem than just a player problem.\n\nFirst of all, I think it's important to remember how thin the Yankees' prospect pool is, especially in the outfield.\n\nYoenis Cespedes, Michael Pineda, Dellin Betances, Didi Gregorius, Starlin Castro, Jacoby Ellsbury and Greg Bird are the only outfielders that will spend any significant amount of time in the majors.\n\nI also think it's not wrong to compare the way the Yankees' outfielders have performed to other teams' outfielders and suggest that, for all the talent it may have, the Yankees are not as good at it as a top-tier team.\n\nFor example, last year the team's only outfielder who spent significant time at the major league level was Jorge Mateo, who played in just seven games at the big league level and just twice in the minors this season.\n\nIn the outfield, the team also had four players who spent a total of five games in the majors: Alfonso Soriano, Aaron Judge, Didi Gregorius, and Rob Refsnyder.\n\nThe team didn't have a single outfielder with a positive wRC+, wOBA- or wRC+ rating last year.\n\nOf the top 30 hitters in last year's A.L. MVP voting, including the Yankees MVP last year, only Didi Gregorius and Jacoby Ellsbury have a positive wOBA-.\n\nYou have to go back to 2003 to find the last time the Yankees had two outfielders who hit above .300 for their respective teams. The last time the Yankees had two outfielders with a wOBA- under .300 was in 2000 and 2001.\n\nThis is the type of talent the team is chasing. They've got a guy like Aaron Judge, but they're not good and their current crop of outfielders isn't far beyond .300.\n\nThis seems to me a lot like a team that can win a few games in October, and get out of the AL East race with maybe a couple of division titles, but not much else going for them.\n\nIn addition to having an",

      "This week, I found myself trying to convince people of how difficult it is to get a decent job.\n\nI think it's probably fair to say that, since I started getting work as a designer at Apple last spring, I've mostly seen only two of those experiences. In the two of those, I found myself working under horrible conditions with no job security, no medical benefits, no vacation time, no retirement payments, and no hope for a real career in design. This was my experience in China. This was my experience in the U.S.\n\nMy job was a great gig. It paid well and allowed me a decent amount of time to work on my other passions. It was also incredibly stimulating, and I got to travel a lot, both in China and the U.S.\n\nBut it wasn't working. Which is why I went looking for a job.\n\nMy time there was mostly miserable. There was very little job security. I was on the job for seven months. Six months and a half.\n\nAnd when I say miserable, I mean so miserable that I would never look for another job in a million years.\n\nBut still, there are so many people who do get into design jobs. I'm sure we're all guilty of that.\n\nBecause what if you didn't have that experience? What if you didn't know how to design? Maybe you want to be an engineer? That's okay. Maybe you want to design for a non-profit? That's cool, too. You should aim for that, too! It's totally possible.\n\nAt Apple, I did learn some design skills (though there were also very frustrating problems, like getting kicked out of a meeting because one of my coworkers was giving me feedback about the wrong thing), but I still couldn't find a job.\n\nI tried working remotely, but it was even worse. I mean, I wasn't looking for the exact gig I had at Apple, but I was still working for an employer; just out of the country and not working at home in a comfortable job. That definitely felt like a step down.\n\nThe worst part, though, was that no one would hire me. If I didn't have the experience and the connections, what was the point of applying online?\n\nI still had one job lined up, though, and I decided I needed to try.\n\nSo to prepare myself mentally, I did a lot of research and found a job that sounded great.\n\nFirst, it was in China, but not in Shenzhen. It was in Shanghai. In a large building with a great team of people. And this was the best job I could find: It was full-time, salaried, and I got my health insurance through the employer (which I think is pretty cool, by the way). The salary was a bit low, but the benefits were a lot better than at Apple. It included medical and dental coverage, and it was more flexible too.\n\nI went for a short interview and learned that I would be working in a marketing department. I didn't expect this, but it wasn't too surprising and the work was actually kind of fun. And the interview went well! After a few hours of talking about our ideas, it was decided that I'd be moving to Shanghai after eight months and that I should start immediately. I would be hired as a designer.\n\nAnd then I had a phone call from the recruiter. This time, he informed me that I had been hired as a designer on the first floor. That's so cool, right? I was supposed to be a designer in Shanghai, and now I was going to be doing what I love. But the real question was…\n\nWhat the hell is Shanghai?\n\nAs I understand it, Shanghai (yes, I said Shanghai, not Beijing this time) is probably the most developed city in Asia. It's where a lot of the world's major Chinese banks and financial institutions and large tech companies (some of them American) are. But the reason why Shanghai had such a strong economic boom is that this is a cheap place to live.\n\nAt the time I left, rent in Shenzhen was around $750 a month. Shanghai would cost me around $2,000-3,000 a month. So I was paying a lot of money for just a few days of my life.\n\nShenzhen is kind of like Hong Kong: Lots of cool people. Lots of tourists. A lot of cool architecture. Not enough work for most people. But lots of great people and cool food.\n\nShanghai, on the other hand, felt like a huge corporation that didn't care about your well-being. Everyone worked in high heels (my team and I actually worked in flatshorts and sandals) and ate in fancy restaurants. There was an endless supply of fancy things, and you constantly got reminded that you had to look",

Both are original songs played at the same time in their version of the same Beatles song. The song comes from an Ojama rendition of The Temptations' I Can't Hurry Love.\n\nThis song was first heard as the title track of a 1964 songbook by George Martin and arranged by Martin. A film of this song is also in the film Beatles for Sale. Lennon's version of this song was used on the album Magical Mystery Tour.\n\nLennon, McCartney, and Harrison composed the lyrics to this song together. John Lennon is quoted saying that he did not sing this song at first (he was only around 11 at the time). McCartney wanted to sing this song with an orchestra at Abbey Road. Because of the time frame, the song was not completed until early February 1964, just in time to be included on the January 1965 UK Summer Sessions. McCartney later said that he wrote the lyrics for this song in July 1964, before writing the song The Times They Are A-Changin' .\n\nAt the time of its recording in February 1964, this song was the third-longest running song in the Beatles' album Rubber Soul .\n\n. George Martin said, in 2004, that he felt McCartney did not sing this song quite correctly when he wrote the song - in his original recording, he sang \"wherever you are\". Martin said it was his intention to write a great harmony (possibly with McCartney) for \"Wherever You Are\". George Martin then started playing the harmony on the piano. Paul McCartney did not like George Martin's arrangement, and demanded that George Martin \"fix\" the song. McCartney changed the lyrics from the original \"Wherever you are\", which had the main lyric being \"There's only one place to go/And that's everywhere\" to \"There's only one place to go\" which had no reference to places that he could go (including the future).\n\n\nJohn Lennon said of it on a different album in 1965: \"I wrote this at my sister's flat. We had her house in Fulham, so it was just us at the end of the road on my mother's side there in Fulham. There were no other voices and there were no other instruments. Only George",
      "I was born with blue eyes. Not just the classic blue, but a beautiful, vibrant blue that glows in the dark. But there were so many genes that set it apart from my twin sister's and I thought that I was just unlucky. But my family history is full of blue-eyed people. We even have a doctor with the rare condition. When his daughter gave birth, he wasn't sure it was his or her baby—it was only when his daughter showed symptoms that he suspected he was having a blue-eyed girl. So I got a blue eye kit to make sure it really wasn't me or my sister or even that other doctor's baby... or my baby's. But it wasn't any of them.\n\nMy parents were told they had blue-eyed, but nothing specific. As a toddler I had constant pain and redness. It's been seven years and I've not been helped by the symptoms. Even now, I get red skin, itchy eyes, night sweats, and the pain doesn't go away. I've spent millions of dollars on expensive eye drops, but I'm just told to wear contacts. I have a good eye doctor now, but it's been a while since I have the chance to see her. I have a hard time looking people in the eye. I don't want to appear different from everyone else.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nMy doctors never even bothered to ask me what I want to be, and I don't even know what it means to be blue-eyed.\n\nMy parents were told they had blue-eyed, but nothing specific.

My mom and dad have tried everything in their power to make me like wearing glasses, but this has not helped. So I've gotten out of college and started my business. My mom and dad think I should change my name to Blue Eyes and I have more blue eyes than I know what to do with but they think the name will give people the wrong idea.\n\nAfter three days of wearing blue glasses, I was having trouble seeing anything. My eyes were not functioning normally. I didn't have much feeling in my face either. I went to a second eye doctor. This one had one of those tiny things called an ophthalmologist who doesn't know what to do until they see you and then all of a sudden he's like \"OH, MY!\" I wasn't even blue-eyed, but it was the first time they had ever seen someone with blue eyes. And they thought I could have had surgery.\n\nI have to walk around with sunglasses on to see oncoming traffic. I am told I am wearing too much eye makeup or too much eye powder. I've had some really ugly surgeries. And at times the pain is like a firecracker inside of me. It's like I can't sleep or I can't concentrate because I have these blue eyes.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nI have to get up in the night and put on a pair of my blue contacts to go read. I try to be careful, but it still feels like I haven't woken up in the morning. I still wear them to sleep.\n\nThey only see what my doctor tells them. They don't look for the genetic clues. They don't know anything about people who are blue-eyed, and I don't know what they'll say if they find out that I was born with blue eyes.\n\nI have a hard time looking people in the eye. I don't want to appear different from everyone else. I want to make sure that no one takes my blue eyes for granted.\n\nI also don't feel that I'm being treated well by my doctors. Some of them want me to do more surgery, but I feel like this is probably a little too much and I've got to let go. A lot of my patients tell me they've been treated badly and say that they hope that I never have to go through this. I am only 30, but I feel like my parents are going",
      "(CNN) A small town pastor arrested on child porn charges claimed on Thursday that he had been framed.\n\nThe Washington County sheriff's office said that 44-year-old Eric Matthew Strom, of LaGrange, Georgia, had been arrested this week on possession of child pornography charges after a confidential informant told authorities that Strom admitted to downloading child pornography over the internet.\n\n\"He claimed his laptop was set to download a specific file when it was seized,\" Washington County Sheriff's Office spokesman Scott Ballard said of the informant, who would not be named as part of the investigation.\n\nInvestigators said that between April 2014 and July 2016, Strom downloaded some 100 images. Authorities say they found evidence that in some cases, Strom provided a file to the informant that contained images of children.\n\n\"He admitted downloading the file about three weeks after he was arrested, and that was the only file he mentioned in connection with this case,\" Ballard said.\n\nRead More",
      "I just want to let you know that on August 1st you won't see any more of the videos I've uploaded about the project. It's time to say farewell. I wanted to write this letter today because the project started out with many people hoping that the project would work, and by September we were over 100 people involved creating things with our passion. It has been a big life changing project, and hopefully, it was not in vain. The project has brought me, my family, and the community of Pigeon Forge together in an unprecedented way. I want to thank all the people that I have ever met, for helping me get up to speed with making things with the Raspberry Pi. The project has been truly inspiring, and I want to give a special shout out to our awesome sponsors, who helped make this happen. In particular, we love the incredible stuff from Makerbot , the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Raspberry Pi, and Coolesto\nPigeon Forge would not be where it is without the support of the makers, and fans, of the project. We are immensely grateful, and would really encourage you to check out www.pigeonforge.org . This project wouldn't have gotten off the ground without the people that have been so passionate about it. In closing, I just want to say that I hope you have enjoyed the project as much as I've enjoyed creating it. Thanks for all the wonderful people that have helped us out with this project.",
      "Roughly two-thirds of American women experience sexual assault during their lifetimes. (iStock)\n\nIt is more than a statistic. It is personal. It is terrifying. And it touches on one of the most pressing issues facing public health today — gender-based sexual violence.\n\nFor more than two decades, the White House has taken the issue of violence against women particularly seriously. In fact, President Obama is credited with helping pass the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. His administration has implemented more initiatives on the issue than any before him. And to its credit, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services have taken this problem more seriously than ever.\n\nIn fact, this morning the president held a White House summit on sexual assault. There's never been a better time to address the issue. However, the way forward seems as cloudy and muddled as ever.\n\nIt's been two decades since the 1994 VAWA came into effect. That is why so many victims are still looking for help. And it is why it is so hard for us to get beyond the statistics and the statistics only tell half the story. That is why we need a national plan on sexual assault and how to create a safer environment for victims on college campuses, in the military bases and workplaces across the country.\n\n[Sexual assault in the military will have to be more of a surprise]\n\nToo often, sexual assault and rape are treated as just part of the culture. As victims, we are called \"brave\" or \"heroes\" for coming forward and filing a police report. But when sexual assault happens, it becomes something that our community expects. Women and men, regardless of their age or background, are expected to accept unwanted sexual behavior and move on. Those who don't, who say \"no\" and make demands of a man who can't or won't listen, are deemed \"aggressive\" or \"provocative.\"\n\nThe statistics speak for themselves. A 2012 study conducted by the Department of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which looked at 10 years of sexual assault and violence prevention, put the number of sexual assailants at 3 million. A 2009 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that one in five women and one in 71 men will experience sexual assault from their lifetimes.\n\nEven more frightening is the fact that victims never seem to acknowledge that rape can be a crime. And most rapists are serial predators. In one-fifth of incidents, the perpetrator was never apprehended. Some sexual assaults are not crimes at all. The National Institute of Justice has estimates of \"undetermined intent,\" in which the victim may never even remember what happened.\n\nIn short, our culture of victim blaming, excuses and violence has caused us to believe that the problems that are rampant in society are caused by individual bad people, not by societal issues. This is the real tragedy of rape culture. There is no other kind.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. We are capable of being a better, safer place for all of us. We can all lead healthy marriages. We can all play by the same rules. We can all be decent to each other. We can all work to end sexual violence. And we can all do a better job of being a source of good for other survivors.\n\nToo many survivors find it too difficult and too frightening to report. For me, this is a common experience. When I had this feeling that I was somehow \"asking for it,\" it was terrifying to realize that this feeling is exactly what someone who is raping me is doing. In many cases, this feeling is the same as what someone who is being raped might feel.\n\nThat is what we need to change. This must stop.\n\nSo how can we change? A recent study conducted by the Public Health Institute found that the first step is changing the way we look at and think about sexual assault. One major factor that affects reporting is cultural, rather than gender, awareness -- the idea that sexual assault is not only a crime, but a \"women's issue\" and not as much of a threat to men as you might think.\n\n[The real threat to women? The myth of the 'sex offender']\n\nIf we really want to fix this, it is critical that all people, no matter where they are on the spectrum, be able to tell the difference between a rape and consensual sex. And that means that we have to change how we look at those who are sexual offenders. As Dr. Margaret Heffernan, a pediatric surgeon and medical director of the Child Life and Community Service Program at Children's Hospital Boston, recently noted, \"The majority are not rapists, but they often are predators seeking access to children.\"\n\nThis is why I have dedicated my career to changing the public perception about sexual assault. I have helped lead the first White House task force on this issue, which will be released soon. We will develop public awareness campaigns on this issue",
      "CALGARY – There's nothing more rewarding than a victory when you've worked long nights, you're down in the dumps, and someone lifts you up in triumph to bring you a glass of wine.\n\nThat's exactly what the Edmonton Oilers did to the Calgary Flames in overtime Tuesday night. It was a great win for a team that desperately needed a win and one that gave plenty of hope to the rest of the Western Conference.\n\n\"We were just able to stick with it late,\" Edmonton winger Matt Hendricks said. \"It was the third one in a row that we've been in that situation and we didn't fold. We tried to stick with it. That's something we've done better than most so that's all we can do.\"\n\nThe Oilers didn't fold so much that they folded.\n\nThey didn't get beat by the speed and skill of the Edmonton Flames. They didn't play their best game despite an opportunity to try to close their five-game road losing streak.\n\nThe Oilers have won three straight games and five of seven games and are 3-0-1-0 so far this season.\n\n\"There's no doubt you play better in that situation,\" head coach Dallas Eakins said, \"and you don't necessarily need a lot for it to go your way and that's the way it's worked for us.\"\n\nBut in a way that's very refreshing.\n\nIt's been a long time since the Oilers have had so few expectations. The Oilers have a long history of coming up short, of losing games and often in heartbreaking fashion.\n\nThis has been a long time coming but it looks like the Oilers finally have some momentum and are looking like a playoff contender once again.\n\n\"It's hard to win in these kinds of games and to win late like we did tonight, it's tough,\" forward Jeff Petry said. \"I think we were prepared and we did a good job staying focused. It's a good start and we've got to keep it going.\"\n\nThere are still a few games remaining to play for the Oilers and the playoffs are still very much in the wings. But on this night when they came back from an 0-4-2 deficit to beat a team that was fighting for its playoff life in overtime and beat a team that wasn't the best team in the NHL, the Oilers were a winner.\n\n\"This is the first game we've lost at home on the road,\" Hendricks said. \"We've got a good team and they got a good team tonight so it's just an incredible result for us. But our group, we did a good job of building up the lead and we couldn't let one in. That's the way this team is, we've got to stick with it.\n\n\"We are a better team than we were. Tonight was a great win for us. It was one that we needed and it was a lot easier said than done and we're happy to be able to get it this time.\"\n\nEakins said that he talked before the game with forward Brandon Davidson, who was sent to the AHL for conditioning, and his response was priceless.\n\n\"Brandon kind of talked me through it in detail for a few minutes last night and he said we really needed to stick with it until the end and make a play at the end of the game to give ourselves a chance to win,\" Eakins said.\n\nThe Oilers have been playing with the lead a lot lately but it didn't matter for this one.\n\n\"The guys stuck with it,\" Davidson said. \"We were just looking to stick with the game after we got outplayed and we started getting in the flow after we did that and I think we got the second goal and kind of put ourselves in a good position when we needed it.\"\n\nThe Flames didn't get it themselves.\n\nFor about 25 minutes in the third period the Oilers out shot them 14-5 and the Flames were just waiting for their opportunity to make it official.\n\n\"It takes a lot of patience to play those games,\" Hendricks said. \"Especially with the injuries to our team and the fact that they're kind of banged up. I think we did a pretty good job of playing the right game for the first 15 or 20 minutes of the third but we couldn't do it for that long.\n\n\"The way we finished it, I think the guys stuck with it and they found a way.\"\n\nEakins said after the game that that first change of momentum was huge for the Oilers and for their confidence going forward.\n\n\"We've been in that situation before. They've played great in these situations so it was great to see that we took advantage of that,\" he said. \"You win with class, you don't do it with class. You do it with grit and with class. We did it with class and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "The two-part Season 2 finale of \"True Blood\" will offer some exciting plot development that we're going to get right into.\n\n\"It's all leading into something so great,\" showrunner Alan Ball told TVLine at PaleyFest on Sunday, at the Television Critics Association's press tour.\n\nRELATED: The 10 Biggest News Items from PaleyFest\n\nIn Episode 16, there's a huge reveal, but it's not what fans are anticipating or anticipating might be the biggest reveal. It's the reveal that there really is a supernatural element in the episode. \"There's more to it than anyone in the show is aware of at the end of Episode 16,\" Ball said, referring to Season 2 episodes 17 and 18.\n\n\"I don't want to spoil what happens in the finale, but I can say that [a] huge deal is going to happen that will change everyone,\" he continued.\n\nA \"huge\" thing could mean a character is going to die, or it could be some sort of momentous event that will force Sookie to take a step back, or it could be some sort of revelation for a couple characters.\n\nRELATED: \"True Blood\" Season 3 Will be \"Supernatural in the World,\" Showrunner Says\n\nRELATED: Season 2 of \"True Blood\" Starts with Another Story About Sookie (Exclusive)\n\nAnd what will happen to the vampires and the humans, who will be fighting, in that big fight? \"This is going to give a little insight into what they're fighting for,\" Ball said. \"Because you won't get any explanation of it in the finale. People will continue to debate it and try and figure out what's going on.\"\n\nWhile we don't know what this reveal is, the season finale is \"all about Sookie and the consequences of what she said,\" as Ball puts it. But in the finale, there will be a big twist that will show her perspective a little bit.\n\nRELATED: \"True Blood\" Recap: Sookie's Story Ends in Disaster, Jax, Will, and Blood Reign!\n\nIn the season opener, viewers got a very nice glimpse into how Jax is dealing with the past, which will be very big in the second episode. And on \"Worth it,\" there will be a big character moment between Sookie and Ray.\n\nBall told viewers that Sookie may not be a very interesting girl at first, and how did Sookie come to know and grow as the woman she is now? \"She has to learn the ways that she's supposed to live,\" Ball said. \"She might be a little bit of trouble. She may not know where she is going to end up in the future.\"\n\nBut Sookie has taken some big steps in Season 2, including working on her mother's farm. \"She went back to her mother and had that vision, where her mother was trying to save her, and she did,\" Ball said. \"She saw where there was something in the future she wanted.\"\n\nRELATED: \"True Blood\" Exclusive: New Posters and Concept Art\n\nSookie will also grow up.\n\n\"Sookie is learning the truth about her own mother, and [she's] going to grow up in a way that is more mature,\" Ball said. But, again, while we don't know what's going to happen to the vampires and their relationship with the humans, a big fight will happen between the two sides.\n\n\"It's going to take an epic fight,\" Ball said.\n\nRELATED: \"True Blood\" Renewed for Season 4!\n\nSeason 2 of \"True Blood\" airs Tuesday at 10 pm EST on HBO.",
      "As many of you know I live in my car full time. I started having a serious addiction to using my car to ride for my trips to work, and also for trips into the city. I've lost count of how many trips I've taken since I started driving a car 12 months ago. I really don't have a goal with this addiction, because it just works.\n\nI recently purchased a 2013 Chevy Tahoe for $5,400, and a 2015 GMC Acadia for $2,000. I bought the Acadia from a local GM dealership and the Tahoe from a local Chevy dealer. My lease was 2 years (I bought it in January 2015). The Tahoe has 3 key fobs which were supposed to be replaced the first year (they were), but since my main car, the Acadia is a long-term project, I figured I'd wait until then. I decided to pay off the Acadia in full by December 2016. I would then pay off my whole car by the end of 2017.\n\n\nI'm taking the trip to the end of this year that the Acadia was built for, and I'm traveling with my fiancé, who has had his own little love affair with cars since he was a young boy. He is a professional landscaper, and has already traveled extensively through his own car. Although I will be using both cars to the best of my abilities, I feel like I'll have the more relaxed experience when I am in an Acadia, because I'll be able to keep my head down and concentrate on the task at hand.\n\nHere's where my journey can become different though.\n\nI've started working on my book, to be published in June 2019. It's a nonfiction book about the automotive industry with over 100,000 words of content, and has taken me 6 years to write and write for. I'm not a professional freelance journalist. I'm not an investment banker, a lawyer, or even something that remotely resembles a journalist. I'm a car enthusiast.\n\nI'm working on the book, and writing articles for my personal automotive blogs, the most notable of which is my Jalopnik automotive blog.\n\nMy fiancé, who works in media, and I just recently started a small YouTube channel, TheCarsAreAwesomeCars, where we put video clips from our personal experiences together to show off what a car can do.\n\nIn 2017 I would have a chance to get a great price on my Acadia, which is now approaching the end of its 2-year lease. I'm not sure I'll be able to get it for less than $5,800 this year...probably not.\n\nBut I do know that if I do find the right offer out there at a cheaper price, I might find myself buying the Acadia again. To me this is more a fun experiment than anything. This experiment is about putting my money where my mouth is. And I'm definitely going to keep writing for the personal car blogs.\n\nWhat might not work out so well, is me taking both my Tahoe and Acadia on the road on the same day. I already have a ton of gas in my tank, and I still have to fill up from time to time, at $4 bucks a pop. I'd probably have to rent a gas station in the vicinity as well. I just don't think I'd make it through the day. I'm not sure if it's impossible. But it's certainly more than a slight risk.\n\nWhat I wouldn't do, is use both of my cars in any similar fashion. If someone told me I could drive my Chevy Tahoe and get to work in the Acadia at the same time using my personal transportation (at the expense of being unable to use my own car as an overnight transport), I'd be skeptical.\n\nI'm aware that you might feel that I'm \"trying to do this the wrong way\" because I'm making a sacrifice to my own life in order to help my fiancé, and I would agree with you. I'm willing to give up driving my own car, for the better. But is that a sacrifice worth it? Not to me at least.\n\nI don't want to do this because when I travel, I want to keep a certain amount of control over things. When I'm in the car, I don't want to be in control. I don't want to be in full control of my car. I want to be in control of the experience. And I want to have a choice in being in control of my experience.\n\nI don't want to put my life on the line. But I also want to make sure that whatever the outcome is, I'm making the better choice. I've seen too many situations where people got into a car accident and someone ended up injured...and then people looked at them and said, \"Hey, you should have just stayed in your car,",
      "We're used to our smartphone screens becoming brighter in the days after summer. Samsung, by contrast, has made more than just a visual change about to appear on a new variant — it also brought with it its latest version of Android.\n\nThe G5 comes equipped with either a Snapdragon 820 or 821 processors, depending on how you look at it. While the 820 is the top of the line (albeit older), the 821 is the more modern offering that'll help power a long, long run — or at least at Google's insistence.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge specs\n\n\nAs you'd expect, the new Samsung phones will be running a mix of Android 6.0 Marshmallow and Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. The 820 is the more recent chip, but both the 821 and 821b should support the latter version as well.\n\nThe G5, the S6 edge, and the S6 will all sport the Snapdragon 820, which features four Cortex-A53 CPU cores clocked at 2.4GHz. That's more than enough for most tasks to move ahead without much difficulty.\n\nThere's a lot of beef in the new G5, though. It sports an enhanced camera, a much larger battery, a new fingerprint sensor (and its accompanying accompanying home button), a new design for the battery itself, and more — here's Samsung's full list of new features.\n\nIt'll come with the latest version of Android, Marshmallow, on top of it.\n\nWhat else is new?\n\nBesides the hardware, there's new software — the usual Android OS, of course, but also Samsung's new smart home tech to help you automate even more of your home activities. It includes a smart home system called KNOX that puts voice control front and center.\n\nSamsung promises you'll be able to play the latest games on your G5 and even interact with Samsung's new S7 Edge, with its much wider display.\n\nThe phone will also include Bluetooth 4.2 LE (which brings the number of Bluetooth-enabled devices on the market to two), a USB-C port for charging, and a 13-megapixel shooter. It's capable of shooting 4K video at 30 frames per second.\n\nWe're still waiting on the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge specs, which could include a new color option, a larger battery, an LTE variant, and of course, a higher price.

      "LONDON: India's largest steel conglomerate, Essar Group , has been fined £100m after it emerged that thousands of Chinese workers were secretly exploited to build its plants in India.\n\nThe company is the second large business to be hit with fines over abuse of its workers from the UK. Tata Consultancy Services earlier this year agreed to pay £300m to the government.\n\nEssar said on Wednesday that it was paying the total fine, which includes the profits of the firm's operations in India, and would \"seek to implement necessary improvements and measures\".\n\nThe group's Indian arm, Essar Steel, is still operating and is the second-largest steel producer in the country.\n\nEssar said that the \"illegal acts of this rogue company\" had cost the government of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh £1.6bn in tax and other benefits - but denied that it was breaking the law.\n\nA total of 3,500 Chinese workers were \"permitted to stay in India on false documents\", it said. \"These companies and the illegal labour supply chain created in India by this rogue company were responsible for the deaths of as many as 2,100 persons.\"\n\nThe company insisted that the abuses took place in 2007 and 2008, a period during which it was running a factory in Mumbai.\n\nIt said that after learning of the abuses last year, it had sought \"full disclosure\" and \"full remediation of the root causes\". It said it had changed its labour policies and procedures and was \"fully committed to ensuring all the necessary steps are taken to ensure that human rights are respected.\"\n\nOn one site in the state of Chhattisgarh, a major source of cheap, illegal Chinese labour, it said Essar had decided to close it immediately following a meeting with workers and trade union leaders.\n\nIt said it had closed more than 50 plants in China.\n\nThe European Union's chief executive, Jose Manuel Barroso, said on Monday that the UK's two major steel plants were \"fraud, not steel\".\n\n\"Truckloads of Chinese workers are being sent to our roads to build roads which will be used to ship our steel products to the European market,\" he said. \"This is not steel. This is fraud, not steel.\"\n\nHe said it was important that the government in the UK could see \"how deeply entrenched this fraud is\".\n\nIn June, Tata Group set aside nearly £2bn in the United Kingdom to help it combat anti-competitive practices across Europe.",
      "The US government has the resources to fight the so-called \"Islamic State\" (IS or ISIS) and the threat it poses by using aircraft, ships and special operations forces, US defense secretary Ashton Carter said.\n\n\"ISIL can't destroy America, it doesn't have the military wherewithal to do this. Now, is ISIL a real threat to the broader world? Absolutely. Do I think they're a major threat to the United States? Absolutely. But, it has no military capacity. None,\" Carter said at the Pentagon on Thursday.\n\n\"We have all the weapons, we have all the capabilities, we have all the resources that the United States has in the world.\"\n\nREAD MORE: US and Israel to conduct massive joint airstrikes in Syria, Iraq\n\nAccording to Carter, US President Barack Obama is making sure that he has the troops, ships, and fighter jets to fight back IS militants.\n\n\"We will fight them in the air. We will fight them on the ground -- from the sea, from the air, and we will fight them wherever they try to expand their presence in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, we do need to be careful to not assume that there's going to be an enemy everywhere we go. There is, but it will be very close to home, and we will do everything we can do to be helpful there.\"\n\nObama spoke with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday evening, telling him that the United States and Iran have shared the \"same goals\" in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\n\"We have a number of areas where we think we can work together. And I am happy to report to you that this discussion has not yet reached the stage that would require you to go to war,\" Carter noted.\n\n\n\"We believe it won't. The president has made it very clear to me that is a bad idea, that Iran cannot be attacked unless they're using their military assets to attack our friends and allies. And we are convinced that we can work together in the right ways.\"\n\n\nCarter also reiterated that the United States would continue to work to end the conflicts in Syria and Iraq and help stabilize those countries.\n\n\"My goal is simple. I want Iraq and Syria free, and we want the region free,\" he said.\n\n\nThe defense chief stressed that he is confident ISIS is being weakened and is \"less than 1,000 fighters\" from the group.\n\nHe said fighting ISIS alone would require a lot of resources, and suggested that it was likely only a matter of time before other jihadist groups would enter the fight.\n\nAt the same time, American forces will not allow ISIS to expand to areas outside the Middle East.\n\n\"It is important that we do have strong allies in the Middle East and the Arab world and Africa,\" Carter said.\n\n\n\"We have a long way to go. ISIL, by its nature, is more a foreign threat. It has neither national borders nor a central leadership that can command forces. That's why we need the Arab League, the NATO members, the United Nations forces -- and of course, we are not going to tolerate this kind of thing in our own region. I believe we need to stay the course.\"\n\nREAD MORE: US-led coalition fighting ISIS - 'We can make a substantial difference'\n\n\nCarter was speaking at the Pentagon.\n\nThe US Defense secretary spoke with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the meeting. The two spoke about the ongoing war on the \"Islamic State,\" which has also been referred to as \"ISIL\" in recent years.\n\n\"We've had extensive discussions both about the current situation and what I think the threat is from ISIL as well as the regional effort that is underway to degrade and defeat it,\" Carter said.\n\n\"I asked the PM [Netanyahu], 'Do you see this as the next step for the Middle East and the Arab world, and what does that mean to you?' And he agreed. He is interested as all of us are in dealing with the threat posed by ISIL and is committed both to Iraq and Syria and is confident that we will prevail.\"\n\nThe defense chief added that his country would \"continue to make every effort to help the Iraqis succeed in that campaign.\"",
      "I got a freebie pack with the second book in the series from Goodreads today. Now I wonder if I'll read another book in this series. The first book of the series was really good. This one is just not quite as good. That said, I really like this series. I do not like it as much as the first one, but I can see why they make the transition so often. It is one of those series where it has to change the entire setting. It did so in the first few books. It has changed the entire setting again in the second one. It is now a new Earth. For those who did not know it is set in an alternate reality but the overall basic plot is the same.\n\n\nIt takes place on the planet of New Corinth as the first three books did. They were set at the same time period as the first book and I enjoyed them. This first book is set four years after The Second Coming, the book that was a prequel to The Ascension. The setting is one that did not change at all. But the people who live there have been changed for the worse. The humans used to rule the planet. Now they have a very limited rule. It was all in the first book and the one before. In the second book the humans were given their own continent. It is divided into four cities as they were never given a separate continent the third book before that. In the first book, the people also had their own race. While in this book they have been replaced by aliens who are also aliens.\n\n\nThe aliens are called the Omati and they were once humans. They were not happy to be ruled by humans. As they are an alien society they are not exactly sure what the humans really want. What the humans are more curious about is why these humans chose to become humans. When they first arrived Earth they could make their way wherever they needed to. They could do so pretty much anywhere they wanted so they had no problem. But as the years followed there were times they would need things they were not made for or they just needed to live in some safe place. For example they are very large, but they are not the best climbers so many times they were forced to build a ladder in order to get around. At first the humans felt sorry for the Omati. They thought that they were little more than animals. But these humans eventually realized that they could never live in the safe city of New Corinth so they tried to make better use of what they had and the Omati were not going anywhere. They had a long standing feud with the Omati. They hated them that same.\n\n\nAnyway, the Omati had a long history with the humans. They have been humans as long as those human are remembered as humans. During their years of hating humans they were a peaceful people but humans eventually broke that peace.\n\n\nThe story is very interesting. I would have liked to have seen more of the humans as a group. The Omati were a lot different then the people of New Corinth. The reason for that is more than just the Omati are aliens. This is one of a dozen alien races in this series and they were one of the last alien races left on the galaxy. These aliens are on their own now. They have a unique relationship with Earth. Some do not like humans. Some do not like each other. And they are both living on the same planet, they have no interest in anything else. The humans at New Corinth were not the only ones left as so many other species had left the planet. Most of them settled in the city of Corinth but some of them came over to the other city. The Omati never understood why many of the humans left. They had left Corinth to build a good society. They left so they could live where they need to.\n\n\nThe aliens also never understood why other races left before them. They had been on Earth long before the humans were ever created. During The Ascension, Omati and Humans did not even have a word for the humans. They did not do so well when the humans arrived. But in the time following the initial landing, when the humans were still just people and the Omati had not yet had time to understand the other humans and other alien races they became friends. The Omati did not even understand the humans to the extent that they knew what the word Humanity meant. The humans were the last of the remaining alien races on the world. As humans became the rulers on Earth the Omati could not stay. They had had to leave. But why? When the humans left and the Omati left why did they not just start something new? They could have. What kind of a person will leave the world behind they will not really know. They did not really understand the humans and why they had left them all in a situation like they had.\n\n\nThe reason the Omati left was that they felt betrayed by the humans",
      "A long-time favorite of the food blogging community, chicken wings are a great way to use up leftover bone marrow or chicken fat. Chicken is a leaner option than beef, and can be served in a variety of different ways–for instance as sauced-up burgers, in a baked potato salad, or as a savory salad spread.\n\nThe key to perfect wings is cooking in just enough fat to coat the chicken, while avoiding too much so the chicken won't turn dry. Once it's on the bone, the skin gets crispy. Once it's cooked through, you can also serve it as a side, as part of a salad, or as a light meal.\n\nMy Favorite Staple Recipes\n\n1. Baked Wings\n\nThis is a classic baked chicken Wing recipe. I get it all the time at weddings, birthdays, and special events. There are two ways to prepare these. You can either bake them or fry them. Which one you do is completely up to you. The baked version is my favorite; it has a lovely golden crust, and the wings are perfectly cooked through. The fried version is easy, and is what I usually choose to make to satisfy requests at my guests. If my wings aren't to your liking, you can always substitute a different cooked-down meat for these wings.\n\n2. Sweet Baked Wings\n\nMy favorite way to prepare wings so far. Although I make these wings by hand, I also buy wings at the store (it's cheaper than buying from the grocery store, after all), and they come skin-on. As such, these wings don't turn all crispy, and the outside can become dry. With skin-on chicken wings, I fry them to get the crispy skin, making them my favorite baking and frying wings. Since these are sweet, I've also added some vanilla, vanilla extract, and cinnamon to my batter. Perfect and decadent!\n\n3. Smashed Wings\n\nIt's tough to beat homemade wings. Even harder when they're perfect. I like to use a dry rub, but I've also used a sweet honey and a sweet tomato sauce recipe. As always, you can use the same recipe, mix it up, tweak it, and enjoy. For these smashed wings, I like to use dried cherries, crushed tomatoes, and ground pepper. A bit of garlic or chives would also be nice.\n\n4. Cauly Chicken Wings\n\nI use a dry rub. I think it gives them a little more punch. I add a bit of red pepper flakes, but you can also use a combination of herbs and spices such as thyme, paprika, ground ginger, and garlic powder. I've also added an extra scoop of dry breadcrumbs. These are good served as a side or in a burger. Or eat them as a burger! Who doesn't love a fresh burger dressed in a homemade dressing?\n\n5. Baked Chicken Wings with Feta & Fresh Thyme\n\nFor many years, I made some variation of this recipe. I use a dry rub, and sometimes add a bit of fresh herbs, such as dill weed. I add some butter, Parmesan cheese, and dried herbs. I love to serve this up as a burger, alongside a roasted green salad, or sprinkled on top of grilled chicken tenders and grilled veggies.\n\n6. Baked Chicken Wings with Bacon and Cheddar Cheese\n\nNow these are one of my new favorites. I make these the most often, and my guests love them. I start out by seasoning the chicken wings and coating them in your favorite dry rub. Then I top the wings with your favorite favorite burger condiments. For this dish, I like to top it with bacon and Swiss cheese. I garnish with a bit of bacon and red onion, and garnish with some fresh cilantro.\n\n7. Cajun Chicken Wings\n\nThese are more like wings than baked chicken wings. It's a little different from the ones above. I make these by frying and broiling the chicken, then basting the skin in the basting liquid from my dry rub. Then I brush the chicken with a mixture of mayonnaise and butter before frying up the wings. The wings cook up really fast, so you want to be sure that the oil is hot before serving the wings, so they don't dry out. This is a great side dish for summer gatherings, grilling, or even as a sandwich.\n\nI hope these wings inspire you to make them for dinner, or make your own delicious cajun wings and let us know if you love them as much as we do!\n\nHappy Wings!!\n\nAdvertisements",
      "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra's community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\n\"Do not let your dreams be dreams for they will lead you astray\" - Arthur C. Clarke\n\nI got the question, \"What is your definition of success in game design?\" a few days ago on reddit.\n\nNow, I am a designer. I got the first idea for The Witness, designed The Witness, programmed a simple level generator, played the game, and wrote up the post about it. There hasn't been one minute that's not an iteration of a game design, no matter how simple the game concept. Yet somehow, the question in this case, is much narrower. I feel like I have failed at a definition of success.\n\nI think the concept goes like this. Success is not simply \"making a game.\" The success of a game is the experience, not necessarily the game design itself. It's that simple.\n\nI could spend a long time trying to convince you how an idea for a game \"turned out to be a game\" even if that idea didn't end up producing a game in any form. (I would!) One minute you're sitting down to play some games, and the next it's on Steam, sitting on Steam Greenlight, on a shelf you see for a while, and then it's gone, gone, gone.\n\nThe point is that success can only be measured in the success that one has creating the experience, not necessarily the design itself.\n\nI don't want to get too meta or down on games (it's so hard to make a game that doesn't suck) but I also don't care for the concept of \"making a game\" either. The concept of success and success in any field is so nebulous, and when my definition gets too narrow, it can easily feel like a limiting concept. So I like this definition.\n\nA game that made it to the end of the road is not a game that made it to the end of the road after making tons of features.\n\nThis also reminds me of a story. The story is this. A little while ago, after reading a blog on how you can make games that don't suck without being great, I started thinking about what games I like. What games did I like, back in the day? How did I define those games? What was it that made those games so special?\n\nI think the best answer that I came up with that's based in the experience of creating the game was that it's one of those things you've always known you wanted to make. Maybe it was like being able to pick up a game without any knowledge on how to play it, where you pick it up, and you play it for days and days and you fall in love with the game as a result. I think that's the best part! A game that you thought was just about to be a waste of time, turns out to be your calling in the industry.\n\nI think the real essence in game design for me is making decisions like this one. Sometimes it's hard, and sometimes it feels bad, if you decide on a feature over another one. But if you let your mind not do so, you'll end up with something great. I never want to go from making great decisions for the player experience to deciding on feature X or Y over a more compelling feature.\n\nIn this article and in the last in a series of posts about \"designers vs gamers\" I talked about how much more important it is for game designers to be players of their own games. Game designers have to be gamers. To not care about the player experience to the point that they don't understand what gamers want makes my heart hurt. It makes me a bad gamer. It's also the reason I don't play games that I think will only sell and people who do games that only sell are terrible gamers.\n\nBut there are other points to games that don't really fit in. There are other experiences that can be enhanced in the game by adding gameplay mechanics that are outside of the game play experience. There are other games that I think would work better than their current state, just because I have an even greater appreciation for the design and design intent.\n\nIt's all about having an appreciation for what makes a game great.",
      "As of last month, the number of new gun owners has reached an all-time high. It is now estimated that 4.2 million Americans are now legal gun owners, or 12.3% of the population. This is a 6% boost compared with just 5% in 2000 and 15% in 1990. The rate for all households increased from 4.6% to 6%, reflecting the rise in household sizes over the period.\n\nThese are significant numbers, especially in terms of how quickly this has happened.\n\n\"The U.S. population is growing at a pace twice that of the rest of developed countries,\" writes the American Enterprise Institute's Hans von Spakovsky in a recent piece for Townhall. The U.S. is now home to 825,000 new gun owners, nearly 7.5 times as many as were ever born.\n\nThis rapid change in our society is, of course, a result of the dramatic increase in guns and gun ownership since the 1990s. The Brady Campaign report states that gun sales are at an eight-year high.\n\nThe growth of guns is driving this transformation, but guns not only have become increasingly popular, but they also have become less readily available. In the 2000s, for example, the average age for gun sales was 28.9 compared with a median age of 23.1 in 2012.\n\n\"From a public health perspective, it's very difficult not to see what's going on,\" said Thomas J. Smith, an epidemiologist and associate professor of population health at the University of Maryland. \"Gun stores are selling older guns and firearms with the highest level of firepower while younger handguns are moving out of the market.\"\n\nFor Smith, the decline in gun sales is particularly alarming because it is associated with a huge increase in mass shootings – a disturbing trend that has been unfolding for the past two decades.\n\nIndeed, the trend of gun sales in the United States in the past two decades has been an almost exact reversal from the pre-1990s trend. While a dramatic decline in illegal gun sales is often attributed to the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, mass shootings and the increase in gun sales in the 1990s is strongly associated with the 1993 passage of a similar law that expired in 2004.\n\nAs of 2013, there were 1.1 million guns registered in the United States and nearly half of all registered guns were handgun.",
      "Brett Kimberlin explains his new book, \"A Call to Commune\" (May 9). Kimberlin's book argues for the creation and development of small, self-organizing communities. The interview was conducted by Robert J. Barsocchini .\n\nWhen you were still a child, did anything that you did make you feel special? Or do you see your actions as being like any other human activity?\n\nWhen I was in college, I decided to get my degree in history of philosophy while I was also getting a law degree so I could be a trial lawyer. That meant going to law school during a time we were getting rid of the welfare system in America. I did the most difficult and challenging thing I've ever done in my life. I found myself not only doing a lot of work, but it was kind of taking up my whole life.\n\nI became an attorney. I was a criminal defense lawyer. I was a federal civil attorney specializing in class action law. I did a lot of legal work on police brutality cases in which police acted like monsters and then got off because of the law suits they won. We were starting a war on drugs, yet we were sending kids to prison, killing a lot of people for pot, and creating this mass migration of young people from the inner city into big cities to work with us as our criminal justice consultants.\n\nIt was a strange combination of these two jobs that made me feel like an outsider. I'd say most law school graduates feel kind of isolated in the law school environment.\n\nDo you feel that way when you're doing it with people you don't know who have similar life experiences?\n\nThe way I see it, the reason why we've been moving in this direction is because people who could benefit most are being excluded, so we can't make progress. People are excluded from having access to food stamps, they're excluded from being insured through work, they're excluded from being able to send their kids to college, and so on. To move forward, we have to exclude people.\n\nBut what the people who are benefiting from the progress are saying is, \"What are we afraid of? We think that if you exclude people, it will destroy everyone.\" So in some ways it's the opposite of what I'm saying. I'm saying, \"Here's a way where we can move forward, and we can work together.\"\n\nI understand what you're saying, but that's not really the issue, right?\n\nNo, this is what the problem is. The problem is that the people we've excluded have no idea how to be part of the process and have no idea that the changes on the ground are not due to our exclusion, but because we're willing to exclude people. Our exclusion creates this kind of isolation, like, who am I to talk with you because we don't belong to that place?\n\nHave you seen the Occupy Wall Street movement grow and the way that people have adopted the idea of \"community organizing\"?\n\nI think it's just a way of organizing where a group becomes the solution to a problem. In Occupy Wall Street I saw the opposite: It was a really small, very tightly connected group. People began doing Occupy groups outside of a park where people had been camping.\n\nWhat's happened is people have discovered communities. The way to have a community is to take care of it as a living resource. That's always been the philosophy of the commune in Northern Europe. The same way I learned from the commune that is the Zapatista way to do it is by protecting as a living resource. You don't take over someone's land in the country and create community. You take care of it.\n\nA community that is protected becomes self-sufficient again. This is what I learned from the Zapatista. They would go down there and pick up trash wherever they could find it and they collected it in communities by using trucks from community trucks. To get trash and recycling in one neighborhood is good, to get recycling and food in another neighborhood is great.\n\nThe point is, you shouldn't have one or the other. You can't get trash and recycling in one place, you don't do it. That's what the Zapatistas are trying to say: We live out here. We're protecting this place as a community.\n\nThe concept of community is so broad that you can't find people who are all that engaged in any particular area, right?\n\nNot necessarily. In an article I wrote, I talked about the concept of a commune. You have people who are engaged in a wide variety of topics. You have people who are very connected to local issues and local affairs, but they will also bring forward new developments in their everyday life, so it's a broad spectrum of people doing a variety of specific things.\n\nFor the most part the people who are doing it are more politically aligned, or if you look closely at those of",
      "I'm guessing this will have zero effect on the actual release but it's here for fun anyway. I will make an attempt to keep this as \"canon as I can.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the date given is that as of the New Year 2012, in December of 2012. Since New Year is when the story of Zero was first posted here, that's probably the date of when this first took place.\n\nOn one of the many occasions when the three of them were hanging around the church with everyone else waiting for their names to be called, a new man approached them. He said that he was a friend of the three of them and that he wanted to introduce himself. It wasn't long before he became quite a friend, especially of the trio.\n\nThe guy was wearing a suit with a bright pink tie at his neck because he was one for fashion at the very least. He was also quite attractive for his age. His hair was brown and cut in a nice, thin line, with some side-long streaks of white. His eyes were blue with brown lashes and his skin was fair and very soft to the touch. He was of average height and slender. He had a nice, square jaw, and his mouth curled in a way that reminded them rather well of one of their best teachers (a bit older but not by much). His eyebrows were neatly trimmed and were never quite covered by his glasses. His eyes weren't too small but very large. The two red beads that were piercing them were dark- red, but they looked as if they weren't fully contained in the space between his eyes. The only other difference he had was his clothes. They were white, like their school attire, but they were tailored into a kind of dress rather than normal clothing.\n\nThe man looked every inch the gentleman, with his blue, twinkling eyes and an elegant yet easy-going manner. When he spoke to the trio, his words seemed easy-going for someone of his age and stature. He often said something to the tune of \"Good afternoon!\" and that was all he ever did. He didn't often talk about his family, for that was another part of his character that wasn't quite as easy and easygoing to his friends.\n\nThe three boys always enjoyed it when the guy talked to them. It made them feel comfortable, as if they were sitting on an even playing field. He looked up to them when he talked to them and their friends but they didn't look to him. The only people who saw the three of them that much were the two older, \"older\" boys, their classmates from elementary school. The boys were quite fond of the guy. He was a good friend, quite funny while also being kind, and he was quite smart as well. However, the three boys had never talked to a boy like that so far.\n\nThe three boys did think he was quite attractive. They were impressed with their looks as well. The boy's hair was one which they had never seen them in public, and it was an incredibly long and smooth mohawk which grew out of his head. The man was wearing a purple, two-piece suit with white stripes. On his lower jaw, a gold earring glinted in the sun as the boy saw it for the first time. The boy was taller than the boy in general since he was five feet five. He had large, broad shoulders which reached just above the boys' knees, and his chest was large. The boy noticed a tattoo on the back of his neck that read \"Marvin\".\n\n\"I have never seen anything like that before,\" the boy commented with interest. \"What kind of an artist drew it. That's… something quite unusual. I'm not sure what it actually is but it definitely looks like it's made for a tattoo of some kind.\" The boys noticed the tattoo that the man had done to his wrist, a thin line made up of two overlapping circles with a line at its base and on the inside that was thin and bright blue. They knew the man had done something similar to that.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" asked a boy from the sidelines.\n\nThe man shrugged, apparently not understanding the question.\n\n\"Well it's a reminder of something that has happened,\" the boy explained to the trio, taking a step back. \"Before we moved in here, I had a friend that had a girlfriend. He had no idea about our secret but one day she told him that she would be going out with some other boys. He didn't believe it at first but she was very persistent. I had heard him mention them before and thought she told him the truth.\"\n\n\"So then… you guys got involved!\" exclaimed the third boy. His eyes went wide. \"We thought it was all fake!\"\n\n\"Well, yes, it was fake,\" the man interrupted. \"It's a lie that we had been planning for months. There had been",

      "The world's leading producers of high-quality coffee — and our suppliers all over the world — know that there's no such thing as a free lunch. Not for us and not for you. As a result, we have to be smart as well as savvy and make sure what we're producing is the best in terms of both quality and price.\n\nThis is the second time we've looked at quality from a different angle: in the first one, we looked at coffee-quality standards in the developed world. We also tried to find countries where high-quality coffee is consumed in a more widespread way than in the developed world to see whether the standards there are better than the general world norm.\n\nThis time around, we're looking at coffee quality standards in the developing world, particularly in South America, Indonesia, and Turkey.\n\nA good cup of java can go a long way towards alleviating your morning anxiety. In many countries, you can buy a good cup of strong coffee brewed from small coffee mills, which are the most efficient (and least polluting) way to brew coffee. However, there are also countries where such traditional methods are not available. In countries like Uganda and Kenya, a good cup of java requires a bit of extra effort; it's best to order a latte from a local specialty coffee chain.\n\nAlso as mentioned above, good coffee quality will improve your productivity as well. For instance, it's been shown that an extra cup of coffee makes you more alert, and more energetic. That means that you are able to work harder and achieve more. However, you'd be wrong if you believe that it will make you more productive.\n\nThe quality of a coffee will not help you achieve more, and the quality of your coffee will not actually help you achieve more\n\nThe quality of your coffee will not help you achieve more, and the quality of your coffee will not actually help you achieve more. You might even end up spending more time drinking the same old crap again. I'm convinced.\n\nIn some cases, a cup of java could really improve your productivity. But it will never, ever allow you to achieve more than you could already achieve in better conditions. You could work even harder because your coffee is better, but your results will be the same. It's like buying a better car, but not really giving up on your ordinary car. You might save a bit of money initially at the start, but the extra money you invest wouldn't add any value over the existing one. It's a lot like buying an expensive car, but not giving up your expensive car.\n\nThis doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it. If your workplace can't afford your car, you should probably take the bus around the block if there's a good one around. It's fine to use a coffee shop or a hotel that charges a premium price for coffee; however, there are some serious disadvantages to such situations.\n\nOne of the main disadvantages of drinking coffee is that it's a source of calories. That means that when you spend a little time drinking it, you might need to buy other foods just to avoid overeating. The same kind of issue could be experienced when watching movies or TV series. If you feel like you need to eat something because of your coffee drinking, you are more likely going to eat something. This will not only make you fat, but make you much lazier. You are less likely to remember where you left your keys or where you left your iPhone or other valuables. And that will lead to you forgetting the important things in your life.\n\nYou could also forget to drink anything else before getting in that cab, and therefore not be available as a reliable provider of the services you're hired to provide.\n\nThere are all kind of other issues to deal with while your coffee is steaming. You will never be able to pay for things without buying that coffee too, and you will probably eat and drink things without noticing that they are the same things you were consuming before you had a cup. You are in direct communication with the world around you because what you consume is just that; what you consume; not necessarily what's best for your health.\n\nWhen you order coffee, you probably buy the coffee first. This is good, because coffee means good health to most people. However, in order to avoid that you need more than just good coffee. You need a healthy diet and plenty of time for the rest of your day (or at least a lot less time than we have these days). You certainly won't be able to sleep a whole night because your coffee is so strong it makes you groggy. You will also not be able to take a nap. You are simply too distracted to fall back asleep.\n\nYour coffee is just another way for your body to process and deal with the foods in your diet\n\nThe most important factor in a healthy eating is to make sure your diet is balanced.

      "The second of eight children, and just 14 weeks into life, the baby died after being born in a state of shock as her mother was unable to keep her alive\n\nNadia Fazl was born with a heart condition called atrioventricular septal defects that affected several parts of her developing brain including her brain stem. Doctors were unable to operate on her in time for her birth, resulting in her death later in a Texas hospital.\n\nThe family lived in the Middle East for more than a decade before moving to the US and Fazl spent her entire time in a hospital in Dallas. Her condition was severe and she showed signs of severe brain damage, which had been detected by doctors in Dubai in 1997. The mother of three said the conditions caused her to have a very hard time caring for her children.\n\nHowever, some people may disagree (via The Washington Post) that Fazl was a bad mother.\n\n'She was beautiful and I could not imagine a better mother,' her mother, Fauzia, said of her daughter. The family had a tumultuous childhood and Nadia was adopted early on by her mother, who later married and had her three sons. However, the situation was not as harmonious as it seemed. Although she seemed to fit in easily with the family, her own mother, Fauzia, said Nadia \"had a deep hatred of her father, her brothers and of the boys.\" Nadia also suffered from depression. Fauzia said after Nadia was hospitalized with a fever and other complications in 2009, she gave up all the children and took on her father.\n\nThe woman was found dead on Tuesday by her father as she lay on her back in the family's Dallas home after collapsing. Family members say the mother had taken her life just hours before. Nadia was 13.\n\n\"Innocent, lost in the world – I'd give anything to be with her, her children, her grandchildren or her great-grandchildren,\" said her mother, Fauzia. She said her daughter's family did not know what caused her to take her own life.\n\nThe Dallas police department confirmed to The Huffington Post that they had been called to the family's home for a welfare check on Tuesday. When they arrived around 9 a.m., and learned about the death, they called CPS.\n\nDallas police chief David Brown called it a \"tragic and painful situation for the family,\" said in a statement.",

      "On November 6, 1894, after over a month of negotiating, the United States and France signed the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation (known as the \"Amendment to the Treaty of Washington\") which permanently ended the US-France war of 1812. This treaty, in some ways, was a step backwards for the United States from its position a decade earlier as a strong and respected nation—now it had accepted the role of a vassal nation (much like Spain had done a century earlier), albeit for a much briefer period.\n\nThe treaty was written so that it is unclear what the United States was actually getting out of it, and the \"freeze\" in foreign trade during the war was the subject of controversy from the start. Although \"freeze\" can be interpreted as any number of things, it would have to include that the United States would no longer be able to export wool to France—this would have effectively stopped the entire US wool industry. The tariff rates were set to be almost identical to when the treaty was signed, allowing the US to continue to export some wool while the French wool market would shrink drastically. The treaty also provided that US and French ships would still operate in their common \"maritime zones\"—the area in which free trade was allowed.\n\nThe treaty was signed in Washington, DC, by Henry Cabot Lodge of New York and Charles Jourdan of Paris. A press conference was held in Washington on the 5th, and newspapers sent to France were sent there by ship (some of them by sea). This was all very secretive and all very official.\n\nA week later, on November 13th, the President of the United States (Thomas McKean) had a press conference in which he talked about the agreement without having signed it. He explained that he had received a fax from Madame Marie Elisabeth Lartigue, French ambassador to the USA, and that Lartigue had told him that the treaty was a great accomplishment, but warned that there were no guarantees that it would be fulfilled. Lartigue had also reminded McKean that the treaty would not require the French to pay reparations, that the United States and France enjoyed \"mutual indemnity\" if one or both of the parties were attacked, and that no \"other\" nations would be allowed into these areas. All the agreements of mutual trust had been removed, and the United States was essentially giving up its freedom to control its own destiny. The United States would be a vassal state (or \"servant of the Great Powers\" if you prefer), with \"no say in the management of affairs\" on the ocean and in the Americas and no control at all over any of the great resources of the world, including oil. The treaty would have little or no effect on America's standing among the other Great Powers, since all of the other great powers would also have to respect its freedom of commerce and rights.\n\nWhat, then, were the real effects of the treaty? The agreement granted the United States the right to export wool. By October 7, there was a shortage of wool in England and a rush for clothing (but not woolen clothing). Wool was also in short supply, and the British could not keep up their domestic fabric production fast enough—the cost of clothing skyrocketed and the British began wearing cotton.\n\nHowever, the most interesting thing about this treaty for those who are interested in international affairs is the agreement not to interfere in the internal affairs of the other countries. For example, it was stated that \"no foreign powers may enter into any agreement affecting the territory of France, nor any other powers other than States of the United States, which would be prejudicial to the security and to the maintenance of order among the nations or which would affect the relations between the said powers.\" This was a very bold statement, but it was a necessary one. The fact that no other nation would be permitted into the Maritime Zone meant that the United States would be completely at the mercy of the nations in this area and, since the nations themselves were not bound by the treaty, it meant that they were free to act as they wished. So, for example, a Great Power could declare that it would never enter into a treaty with the United States, just as a Great Power could declare that the United States would never enter into any international treaties with other nations. This would make the US completely helpless to influence or intervene in these matters—unlike Germany, which would have been bound to comply with any treaty entered into by the others.\n\nThe treaty also stipulated that all commercial intercourse among the nations would be suspended until the treaty was ratified. This meant that although the United States would be able to trade with everyone now, if the treaty was not ratified, it would mean that the United States would still be subject to the other countries' regulations. In effect, the Americans would be bound to take orders from the other nations, no matter how ridiculous it sounded or how absurd the regulations.\n",
      "Bart is a retired policeman from Kansas. He works as a private investigator (or \"private eye,\" depending on whom you ask) and his partner in the practice is Edna Krabappel. The two are partners in a partnership.\n\nIn the episode In 'N Out, Bart is a cop and Edna is a private eye. Bart finds Edna's house empty, and she finds he is gone, along with the truck they were in.[1] It is unknown if they actually had a falling out. However, Bart is the only character to meet a version of Edna with a different surname.\n\nIn Edna's version of the story, she says that he is working for her, not with her. He is named Bart because it fits his personality.\n\nEdna also is responsible for Bart having a family. She made the idea for him and Marge to get married. Edna's daughter, Jeanette was seen in \"Three Men and a Comic Book\" where she was seen working in a comic shop.\n\nMarge refers to Edna as \"Gramps' mom.\" Gramps is Bart, Edna's husband that she never married.\n\nEdna is seen in one episode named Afternoon Delight, in which she plays a role in helping out the family.\n\nEdna's daughter is voiced by Jennifer Hale.\n\nContents show]\n\nDescription\n\nEdna is a petite woman, almost never seen without a red hat and a red jacket with a big-boy belt holster strap. She is typically seen carrying either a small-frame .357 revolver or a large-framed .44 Magnum revolver, and sometimes a knife concealed in her jacket. She wears a gold necklace and gold-framed glasses on her left side; her right side is clean shaven.\n\nEdna's hair is pink, and she has two black dots between her eyebrows. She has a large round nose, which is typically not visible; as of \"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\", it's been revealed to be more prominent since.\n\nPersonality\n\nEdna is usually cheerful, but can also be very serious. Her relationship with her son, Bart, and his mother is not well-known, but she seems to still love Bart a lot (see above, and after \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\", she was briefly involved with a young Marge as well). She seems to enjoy teasing her son, though to some extent, the two tend to quarrel. She is also quite emotional, possibly due to her son.\n\nDuring one episode it's suggested that Edna has an affair with her superior, Superintendent Chalmers, but it's unknown if either of them actually did it as she would not do anything to help her superiors in a crisis (such as turning a car around);[2] even if she were to have an affair with him, it never would have resulted in Chalmers getting fired as all he would need was two weeks vacation.\n\nEdna's relationship with Marge changes a lot over time. Throughout the series she will sometimes go over to her house when Bart is too tired for playing video games and when Bart isn't around. She will also show interest in Marge's hobbies and interests. Edna is also willing to spend a lot of energy with her son and even goes out on a date with him in \"Who Shot Mr. Burns? The Musical\".\n\nEdna's relationship with her son may have changed somewhat since she first married Bart. She is usually very protective of him and usually sends him to bed with a pillow when something is bothering him in an attempt to break and control him; this appears to change for the better in \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\" where she has shown a kinder, more tender side to her son. It's also hinted that Bart hasn't grown up much since being born and that he has a lot of emotional issues of his own.\n\nEdna's relationship with Bart may have changed in their relationship as well. In \"Who Shot Mr. Burns? The Musical\", she is in a bad mood. She is also the one who finds the gun used in \"Who Shot Mr. Burns? The Musical\".\n\nTrivia\n\nEdna is the only main character who is a mother or a sister's best friend. Bart, Marge, and Joan (Bart's friend) and Mrs. Krabappel (Marge's friend) are not.\n\nSee Also",
      "It is not always easy to make a movie that will attract audiences and make money but, on the other hand, sometimes it is easy. After all, movies are like bread and butter for most of us, as evidenced by the fact that it has been proven that almost all of us do watch movies a lot. One of the things that makes movies popular for us, is that they make us feel good.\n\nThe audience's sense of well-being has been explained by psychologists as the \"mood-induction hypothesis.\" The theory states that when we are made to feel happy, we engage in positive behavior. For example, in order to feel happy, it is important for us to be surrounded by people and things to be happy. The theory also explains that this effect is a relatively simple one: what determines our mood is what we experience. The more we experience pleasure and positive emotions, the more likely they will stay inside our brain and create an emotional memory in our brain. This means that more positive experiences in the past give us more positive experiences in the future.\n\nNow, we can see the reason why movies can be so effective. If there is a good story, if there are interesting and well-drawn characters, if we see and feel the emotions of our characters, it is easy to convince the audience that we have experienced a real good time. This is because movies make us feel good. They play off our emotions, and give us the feelings of being in a good mood. It also makes us feel good because movies also make us feel \"relevant.\" A lot of our memories from our past are related to the things and people that were in our movies at the time.\n\nThe main problem with movies (and in some cases with books, as noted above) is that movies are often short. While books are often considered to be short-form, a lot of movies are long and often have only 20 or 30 minutes of gameplay, while more traditional books can take up to 500 pages. This makes it hard for people to go through a movie and remember everything that happened in the movie. It is also difficult to create a compelling movie experience that does not leave a lasting emotional impact. If you are reading this, that is understandable. If you are a movie watcher, you probably have noticed that movies tend to be over-acted, which may make you uncomfortable.\n\nThis is why it is so helpful to have a game that captures an audience and make us feel good about it. But what kind of game would it be? Here are 3 tips that can get movies better.\n\nHave interesting characters\n\nYou know, sometimes when I watch movies with my mom, we watch both \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Back to the Future.\" Now, I know it is silly, but it happens often; they are basically the same. We end up talking about all of these different characters in the same movie. Movies are based on characters and so it goes without saying that having characters with interesting or complex personalities is going to make audiences more invested in the movie. The important thing is finding characters that are different and fresh every time.\n\nHaving interesting characters is usually a lot easier than you would think. For example, it is easy to create a compelling character with a strong personality. However, you need to keep in mind that people don't like characters that are just like they are. We are very accustomed to seeing someone who is like us in movies, even though they are not like us. Creating an original character that is different from yourself is not that hard to do though.\n\nDon't be afraid to make things complex\n\nIt is so easy to get into the habit of making a movie complicated or complex from the start. This is because most movie theaters can get extremely annoying if a movie is not well animated, detailed and well-composed. These are just three of the most common ways in movies to make viewers want to go home to check out a DVD, watch the YouTube review or check other reviews to get the full picture. For this reason it is important to focus on making a good movie early on, because if audiences don't appreciate it early on, they don't love it.\n\nAlso, the more time a movie has in the box after it has been released, the more time can be spent on making interesting story and interesting characters. If a movie has a long story and interesting characters early in its production, it is much easier to make things complicated later on, when there is more to see and learn.",

      "The US Army has to buy the largest and cheapest fleet of military drones yet built – but it won't be from a European firm!\n\nThe US Air Force will receive the first three of these high altitude surveillance drones from Lockheed Martin, the world's largest maker of military spy airplanes, but the decision was made without the help of a global drone industry. The drones are being developed by the US Army to spy upon Afghanistan. It's not that drones have never been used on the Afghanistan battlefield – in fact they have played a role – but that the drones built in the US would be too large and too expensive to fly at the moment.\n\nThe drones are set to join the fleet within the next few years.\n\nIt's worth noting that the US Air Force plans to replace its older Predator drones. However, since the Air Force is still under orders to buy more Reaper drones, it's not entirely clear who will be flying them. The Air Force would not confirm which company the Predator would be built for.\n\nAlthough some analysts have called the future drone economy a \"disaster\", the decision to purchase from a foreign firm may not always come with political consequences. The fact that the Air Force has been procuring much larger drones from European firms like EADS and BAE Systems could be a reason why the Army has a preference for a US firm, as well.\n\nThe new model of the Cessna T-38 Talon is capable of carrying a 500kg payload\n\n\"The Air Force's drone fleet is big and growing. I expect it to buy more, especially to augment its already-excessive fleet of drones, and that would be more likely to happen from a U.S. manufacturer,\" said Jeff Price, a defense analyst at Forecasting Solutions.\n\nPrice added: \"The reason it would be a U.S. maker is just because the Pentagon uses more domestic manufacturers.\" The Air Force has spent more than a billion dollars on its drone program over the last decade, yet has been forced to fly its large drones in foreign countries for years due to budget restrictions. The budget restrictions are beginning to shift, with a new Defense Authorization Act set to lift some restrictions on government purchases – including drones – when it is passed on Wednesday.\n\nThe Predator and Reaper drones are set to join Lockheed's other military models, like the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles, which are currently the size of a cargo plane. Both the Global Hawk and Predator are operated by the U.S. Air Force.\n\nThe Predators have to fly very high because their sensors can only scan a relatively short distance. The Global Hawk has a range of 600 miles and can scan the entire world. The Predator has a 250 mile range.\n\nAnother advantage of Lockheed's business is that the military doesn't have to buy as many of them as it normally would. The company is one of the largest manufacturers in the world.\n\nIn August last year, Congress passed several new provisions into a National Defense Authorization Act that will allow the military to bypass Congress and buy the drones directly from the manufacturers rather than wait months or years for a new version to be produced.\n\nThe Air Force is currently on deadline to buy at least 654 of these drones. According to Lockheed's latest 2015 financial report, the company's revenues from the military program increased 37.3% in the first half of the year to $1.38 billion, with total revenues from this source expected to reach $1.51 billion by 2015.",
      "We're now seeing that the government is taking the same \"national security\" precautions as you might expect from a \"first world\" government, only they're actually being followed by millions of Americans, who are having their phone calls and web traffic monitored for the government's \"protection.\" Last November, a federal appeals court in Washington, DC, ruled that this was all right, as long as the government didn't use this monitoring to gather information that would be shared with \"any person, including foreign powers,\" per the court ruling.\n\nThe government has taken all these steps (and more), and, according to an article in USA Today, is now collecting millions of telephone records annually, without any restrictions or oversight by Congress or the courts:\n\nThe government has collected vast swaths of Americans' telephone records in bulk, with officials getting permission from phone companies to collect the data. The secret court, which has operated on a secret basis, has authorized the National Security Agency's collection of the data, which the N.S.A. says it is using only for foreign intelligence purposes. But the secret court has also said those with legitimate privacy interests must seek the surveillance outside the secret surveillance court. The government, in other words, relies on a secret judicial body to make secret decisions on matters that should go before lawmakers and the courts, not the other way around.\n\nThis makes no sense. Not when Congress isn't even discussing the issue of national security.\n\nIt's not clear what the rationale is for this mass spying program. It certainly isn't \"national security.\" And yet the administration and Congress haven't been able to articulate anything to justify it. There is no clear legal basis for the president to be conducting surveillance on American citizens who aren't even suspected of any serious criminal activity. It is a recipe for tyranny.\n\nIf nothing else, it should show the wisdom of the American Founding Fathers and the principles they fought for: that government should only have \"police powers\" and not \"military powers\", and it needs to do no more than act as \"a counterweight to the natural tendency to place too much faith in human wisdom\" -- a lesson that the NSA is evidently failing.\n\nUPDATE: This post originally misattributed the following information from a Wall Street Journal article, which I have corrected. This post should have said \"National Security Administration.\"",

      "The new federal data system the Liberal government promised to introduce was a failure, says the chair of the Public Service Commission.\n\nThe Conservatives say the Liberals are making a mess of the system they promised after they were elected in 2015, but the report from the commissioner suggests that's not true.\n\nIn this week's report from the commissioner, Peter MacKay says the problems with the data systems had to be fixed, but they were too big a task.\n\n\"In many cases there were no easy choices or reasonable options because the complexity of the IT system for the national public service (NPS) was such that there was simply no practical way to move ahead,\" MacKay said.\n\nThe federal data system is supposed to be used for three things: managing employee benefits, giving them information about other data the public service has about its members, and keeping track of people's performance, if those are the only three things you can do with the data.\n\nBut MacKay said it's not clear how this data will be used. \"There is not yet a good explanation how the new information system will be used in practice and it is not clear from the public accounts where this new information will be used,\" he said.\n\n\"The new information system has to be put into place at an acceptable and reasonable pace and the implementation of this project has been delayed for far too long, causing significant delays in many of the projects under its jurisdiction.\"\n\nIn 2013, when he was the Public Service Alliance of Canada's assistant secretary, MacKay said, \"We recognize that for a government of any size and complexity to work effectively, IT must be kept, and be put into, a high level of service.\n\n\"That is why the National Defence IT project was originally launched in 2007.\"\n\nThe Liberal government was hoping to spend $200 million over four years to build a new system but that was delayed due to \"unfunded mandates.\"\n\nMacKay said the Liberals promised their mandate letters that the new information system would be operational by the end of next year. And then the Conservatives changed government and then the new government changed its promises, the report says.\n\nBut the report also says the system's problems were also due to the Liberal government's lack of a plan.\n\nMacKay's report says the government tried to give the new work to an outside consulting firm to fix them but then the consultants ended up taking another job. So then the government hired a private consultant to fix the problems again. Then they hired some third party firms to work with the agencies to help them. It ended up costing $6 million just to keep them running — and that wasn't done in the right months or months, the report argues.\n\nIn March 2016, the government had its first full month with the system and it didn't work as planned, the report says. But it only took until May to end up with just three hours of reporting it had promised to do in March.\n\nAnd then the problem with the data systems was compounded by the federal government's lack of information sharing with itself, the report says.\n\n\"Despite the fact that many in the public service already understand or have an understanding of the new data system, there is currently no evidence that they are working collaboratively, collaboratively, to improve the use and reporting of the new data system or to create an optimal user experience with the new data system,\" the report says.\n\nOne solution: use the new system to share, exchange, and access information that's already on record or about the public service, the report says. It says this could be a huge benefit to the public service itself and to employees — especially those who work with the public service.\n\n\"It means they can get information to staff who are not already part of the department or agency,\" MacKay said.\n\n\"And it means they can get the same information that government members have been given. They don't have to go back and sort of dig through every document that we have of individual member's names, their jobs, every time we get a letter or an e-mail. We know that a lot of the information that government members have is really valuable and it could be shared.\"\n\nBut the commissioner also says that's another problem with the public service data system — there is so little information about who's giving what information that there's no system to find anyone who's giving a bad or inconsistent report.\n\nMacKay says the system needs the government to do more to share that information with the public service.\n\n\"We recommend that any new information system should enable a central government-wide reporting mechanism that provides all members of the public service and all members of the public service unions with a single, easy-to-use portal to submit data on themselves as well as their members, and then to receive a report of all those submissions,\" he said.\n\nThe government has not been able to provide \"a working mechanism to ensure that there will be",
      "Reds pitcher Homer Bailey is hitting .294 against the Yankees this season, and at age 35, doesn't think it's time to slow down just yet.\n\nBailey, who turns 36 in April and has been a two-time Cy Young winner in the past two years, told MLB Network Radio's Mark Saxon that he expects to be pitching well into his 40s and thinks things could get tricky once he's approaching the end of his career.\n\n\"Obviously, there's a couple guys here right now that can kind of keep the train running,\" joked Bailey, speaking on the network's \"Bucs Preseason Hot Stove\" segment.\n\n\"I'm not sure what's going on with David Price now that I think the rest of the field here is a little bit different. I know Price could get a few more years in there, and I know Price is working his butt off.\n\n\"But he'll be 35. David Price would probably be 36. It's kind of hard to imagine what that looks like for a guy like me, not having much to fall back on. I think all the younger pitchers on the team could give me a pretty good run there.\"\n\nBailey also was asked about his thoughts on the current Yankees lineup, which has produced six All-Stars since the all-star break, and whether the team needs to change or add at the plate.\n\n\"There definitely needs to be a little bit of a change, for sure, with a couple of guys,\" said Bailey, after referring to the Yankees' offense as the best in the National League. \"They've just got a bunch of guys who are on base to begin with. They've got some depth there. I mean, for us, I think we try to get our guys on base as much as we can, and we try to get everybody involved in the run game and everything.\n\n\"But the Yankees don't seem to have that thing where everybody puts up a bunch of singles, because they give up a lot of doubles. They have some really good hitting, I think, and that's really what they need to turn around. There's also some guys, like Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, who are out there having really great years, but they can have better at-bats. I think if Jeter and Alex both got 40 at-bats a game, I'd be pretty happy with that.\"\n\nThe Phillies have a lot of players in their 30s in their lineup -- including a few guys like Cesar Hernandez, Jimmy Rollins and Matt Carpenter, who are getting closer to 30, and some veterans like Chase Utley, Chase Headley and Cliff Lee, who are in the twilight of their careers. So as much as Bailey thinks it's time to start thinking about his career after this season, the Reds have other pieces on the roster that could help him have a longer run.\n\n\"That's pretty impressive, the way that they've done it in these two years,\" said Bailey. \"You can look at the big picture, I think there are some guys that could definitely do well. I'd be looking at a lineup like that -- maybe I'm too old now, but the lineup that they have, they're not hitting the bottom of the order, they're not getting to third, they don't have a lot of power, they don't have a lot of speed, but some of their more talented players are able to make plays at the plate and do well defensively, and they're able to do well with what they've got.\"\n\nIt's interesting -- and the reason why it was interesting to see the Yankees make some changes to their roster when the season started -- that the Reds have yet to make major changes to their team at this stage of the season.\n\nThat would seem to indicate that the organization believes in the current veterans and the ability of the group to do some great things.\n\nBut the Reds have seen a lot of success within the last few years, winning 87 regular-season games last season, and made the playoffs in 2013 and 2014 as well. Are those wins enough, and now are they enough?\n\nBailey was the reigning National League Cy Young award winner in 2013, when his Nationals beat New York 5-3 on Oct. 4. He has since gone on to pitch with the Marlins, Diamondbacks, Angels, Orioles, Cubs and Astros.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I think it would be great to get back to a World Series,\" he said. \"It's just been so long. We can't win all these games. This is my career. That's what I'm focused on, getting back to a World Series. And right now, it's one of those things -- everybody can see it's a long year, a long stretch for sure, but I'm just going to keep doing the best I can right now.\n\n\"I just feel like, like everyone, I'm",
      "\"A few months ago I was invited to write about the American election.\"\n\n\"A few months ago I was invited to write about the American election.\"\n\nThat's the opening line of a new article for Politico, which looks into \"a bizarre, high-stakes contest that played out between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton this summer,\" that features \"thousands of volunteers\" and \"the largest ever data experiment conducted by a campaign.\"\n\nThe story goes on to tell the interesting tale of a couple of dozen activists who created a website, TrumpData, while they waited in a Brooklyn hotel room to hear the results of the Democratic primary.\n\n\"Trump got more enthusiastic responses, but the real story is that Trump got more enthusiastic responses when he asked them for their help to help him win,\" wrote David Weigel. They \"ran their own small-scale experiment testing the effectiveness of a website, TrumpData, which was started by data scientists at Data Collective, a data firm that specializes in social media analytics.\" The project began July 20 when an anonymous caller invited them to watch Trump's speech in New Hampshire.\n\n\"We went down and voted,\" said Jonathan Johnson, who co-founded the website, and is a member of the data team for the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nFrom there the team spent a few months figuring out how the data could be used to push Clinton closer to the Republican nominee and how they could \"make a better sense of our data,\" Johnson said. Eventually, they used the data to identify swing voters.\n\nThen it got interesting.\n\nThe team decided to use their data to determine whether to open a separate database specifically for Trump voters.\n\n\"There were some pretty powerful reasons we ended up keeping the database separate from the original voter database,\" said Johnson. \"One was to help us with the analytics, the other was just so that we didn't lose data if he won Iowa or Wisconsin.\"\n\nBut the team still had an issue in that many people didn't want to reveal their affiliation with Trump, which eventually lead the Clinton campaign and several prominent Democrats to publicly denounce the efforts by some in the alt-right and other groups to target voters with Trump's name.\n\nSo the data team decided to keep that particular database for now. But the plan was to eventually move it to the Clinton campaign.\n\nWhile there's a whole lot of good in Weigel's article that will surely get ignored by most reporters at Politico, we were a little surprised to find that the story also made mention of Trump's recent claim that he won the popular vote in the election.\n\n\"I guess people are concerned that I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people that voted illegally,\" he said during a rally at Pennsylvania State University on Monday.\n\nWeigel's story went on to explain that the claim was based on the fact that voter fraud was extremely rare — and that most illegal votes went to Democrats, a point we had made the same day.",
      "\"They're out of control,\" he said, noting a series of high-profile attacks at U of C campuses. \"It doesn't matter what you do, their response will be violence. It's frightening.\"\n\nThe university's statement noted the university community would be encouraged to attend a public forum hosted by the campus Black Student Union, 6 p.m. Thursday at BMO Harris Bank Center on U of C's campus. The forum would feature \"an expert panel on systemic and institutionalized racism, inclusion, diversity and equity.\"\n\nUniversity of Toronto (U of T) Black Students' Association (BSAA) vice president Taniya Ali spoke at the rally at noon today, where speakers noted black Americans have made history, won wars and become presidents.\n\nShe also addressed the rally outside the U of T campus.\n\n\"This is a call to action to be a part of the change of this country,\" said Ali. \"We have to bring the revolution from U of T to downtown Toronto.\"\n\n\"We don't want to go back to the days of the Ku Klux Klan,\" shouted a small group of protesters.\n\n\"We're here because we care and we are concerned,\" said U of T professor Dr. Laith Alkhawaja. \"We have seen racism in our classrooms, in our streets and at our institutions.\"\n\n\"We just cannot tolerate racial violence on this campus,\" said Ali. \"We're going to stay here until they all leave.\"\n\nThe rally was sparked by a video that emerged earlier this week on social media that shows a black man being punched and kicked by white students and the University of Toronto Police, which police have confirmed are the subjects of the video.\n\nThe video, which went viral in hours, was created by the group of black students led by Jamal Hunter, who called it \"the first step\" to bringing change.\n\nThe black students who protested, along with U of T black academic, Michael Smith, marched alongside black protesters and supporters on Wednesday and today.\n\nThe U of T's Black Student Union released a statement on Wednesday afternoon, noting it was \"deeply disturbed\" by the video, and is continuing to \"investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident.\"\n\n\"While we welcome the efforts of the video's creator to document and highlight issues with racism across the campus community, there is still room for improvement in our relationship with the U of T community and the response of the university and police, who have both failed in their responsibility to provide transparency to the community that is their responsibility as we have committed to do with this university,\" the BSU statement said.\n\n\"While it is imperative that we continue to work for diversity on campus, the U of T community does not require the university to continue to facilitate the racialized violence that our community experiences every day.\"",

      "\"A woman can be anything you need her to be. We all need that woman in our life and that's why I'm so glad to be a part of that team.\" ―Aunt Vivienne to Cassandra after her acceptance into the Circles of Magic[src]\n\nVivienne de la Rochefoucauld is a major character in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn. She is only mentioned in the past or in cutscenes, but her character is the only one who possesses knowledge about the past. In Path of Radiance, she is the first person to discover the existence of Awakening, and is also the one who helps Awakening defeat the White and Black Dragons. In Radiant Dawn, her status as the Avatar is a mystery even to herself, leading her to try and hide her identity from the Avatar.\n\nVivienne has a romantic relationship with the Avatar, but this is unrequited, due to her belief that a noble birth should determine whether they will be able to fulfil the dreams they had when they were young.\n\nContents show]\n\nProfile Edit\n\nPath of Radiance Edit\n\nVivienne was initially introduced to the Avatar through a letter detailing her discovery of the Awakening. She seems unfazed by such an occurrence:\n\nI knew of it already as I received the letter from your father. But there was nothing I could do. It is impossible to learn of other beings' Awakening before a person has made the decision to do so for themselves. The only way to learn is to find the truth for yourself. So I waited until you were a man of twenty five before sending further letters.\n\nThe Avatar eventually meets Vivienne's father, the marquis Elbert of Tenebrae in Chapter 20. The marquis tells them, in a letter, that the marquis's daughter Vivienne had been abducted with the intention of using her as an Awakening catalyst. The marquis expresses his anger that the marquis would make such a reckless, foolish decision:\n\nThis is not my fault and neither is the man I support. I was just as foolish as his daughter. You were born to rule. That's what it means to be a prince.\n\nThe marquis goes on to lament the fate of the marquis's eldest daughter:\n\nI wish we had not married so young so that the girl's fate could have been spared. It was a terrible mistake, a tragedy...\n\nThe marquis urges the Avatar to learn the truth about the abduction of his daughter rather than listen to his daughter's pleas for her freedom:\n\nMy son has never been one to shy away from a challenge, even if it meant his own death. If the Avatar would only take a moment to listen then perhaps my daughter's captivity could have been averted.\n\nIn the end, the marquis tells the Avatar that, if they would like, he will be willing to teach the Avatar how to summon the Awakening. This, in turn, leads to the Marquis's duel with the Avatar, and his execution on the day of his death.\n\nRadiant Dawn Edit\n\nVivienne's name is given on the map at the end of Chapter 23, and she can be seen on a different map with the Avatar in the following map:\n\nVivienne's role in Radiant Dawn is more central than in the games' past, as she learns of the events at Mount Prism and of the Avatar's awakening at Cleyra Castle. She then accompanies the Avatar on their journey to the capital, where she reveals that she is aware of the Avatar's connection as a Avatar to the goddess Loptous, and that she herself is part of the Circles of the Twelve, the powerful groups that govern life in the world of Fates .\n\nIn an attempt to prevent her lover, Loptous, from being destroyed by her rival, the duke, Vivienne is asked by her sister, the princess Maribelle, to find a way to get Loptous back to her side. Vivienne reluctantly agrees to help, offering her knowledge of Awakening to Loptous. It is later revealed that Vivienne is in fact the Avatar, and Loptous is killed by the Avatar.\n\nHer fate after this is not shown, but it is shown that she and the Avatar continued to make plans to bring Loptous back to her side, and Vivienne even aided the Avatar in their battle with the duke at Plegia Castle.\n\nAt some point after their confrontation with the duke, Vivienne learns that her friend and lover, the duke's daughter, has fallen in love with the Avatar. She is one of the few individuals who knows of the existence of Awakening, and is seen comforting the Avatar on their way back to Orlais. She later appears at the Battle of Plegia Castle, asking the Avatar to stop the duke from making a bid for the throne.",
      "Killer clowns on the loose in America\n\n\"People in the States of America are just too dumb to know what's going on.\"\n\nThat is said to me in an e-mail from an angry American. I'm a little puzzled—because no one has ever given me a reason to be so dumb.\n\nI had an answer. I had just finished speaking at a conference in Washington, DC. I'm a lecturer in international relations and criminal justice at the University of London, and it was about a year ago that I was speaking at American universities on the subject of clowns and violence, before I felt like I had a bit to say.\n\nThe thing about our clowns, the thing about the killers on the loose, the thing is they are so smart they don't even see the people they're killing. And I think this is important because I want to show people that it's not just the media or bad politicians who need to be scared.\n\nI had just begun to explain to the students around me the difference between the killers in Oklahoma City and the ones in Charleston and in Newtown, and I thought I had quite a good grasp on the psychology of mass violence, and the psychology of the killer.\n\nBut then they said to me, \"Who in God's name are you supposed to be? This guy here with the black hood and machete, I don't know what you are and why you're talking about clowns and clowns'.\"\n\nI had to come back with an explanation. I had to come back and argue with them, which meant explaining to them some of the ideas I had been working on about mass violence for years.\n\nI'm trying to explain to people that there is an element of psychology that I think is important for thinking about how violent people are, but that it cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThis was the first time I'd encountered this argument. It's really a dangerous argument, because people are so quick, so insistent on making it that it really has to be said that clowns are not going to change people's opinion—because I can't imagine anything so stupid that they'll change their mind and suddenly change their behaviour.\n\nBut I don't think there will be a long-term effect on how the American government will treat the United States if there are more clowns in public life. I don't want to go too much into details now because I don't want to encourage people to say I've been brainwashed by clowns and that they're going to come after me. It seems to me that would be an extraordinary response to me having a sensible idea. But to my knowledge we've had very few clown threats in this country.\n\nBut it might be justifiable, the argument was, because clowns don't like Muslims, the only Muslims around are from Middle Eastern countries.\n\nBut how can you think they're not going to be involved in violence? You see these pictures online, like that of the man in the white hood with a gun pointing at a Muslim girl. Well, we know these are not the majority of Muslims. The people who make these images are only a narrow minority, so they can't explain the whole group. The other thing for me about these people like this is that they're not really religious. But it's not just that I don't believe that. I know in fact that there are many people who are religious, who are people who follow the Muslim religion. And they're not going to be affected by this.\n\nIt sounds like I'm putting the blame on a particular group. I don't blame all Muslims: I blame this minority, who I think do know very little about Islam but who are motivated by the fact that they want to terrorise the entire population, which is a big number of Muslims.\n\nIt's about how we explain to people why there are people like this. At the moment there will be no evidence that they're influenced by clowns. But it is possible that that could be one reason.\n\nIt wouldn't have been a radical change for me if I hadn't been given the evidence by a guy in white with a gun pointing at a girl in a Muslim headscarf being carried into a library. I would have said it was completely inexplicable. And that's still true, but it would have been a small step for me to explain these people to people who weren't already thinking the clowns were causing this. And it's a shame to have done nothing about this.\n\nBut that's what people like me have learned. We have had a very good year at the conference and I'm really enjoying it. But the next couple of weeks I'm going to have a hard time because I've been speaking at Oxford University and at Harvard, and they're going to be very busy. I hope they feel the same I'm feeling: that clowns are not changing anyone's behaviour. They're not going to put a",
      "We got to watch this one last night and the movie's been done for about 4 weeks so it's a bit choppy here, but the footage is there and I think the movie is pretty impressive.\n\n\nThe idea of the movie is that, after the explosion at the heart of the city, a group of men and woman who know that their lives are in danger attempt to get a boat out of the harbour as fast as possible. They get the boat across the harbour by using a raft with a lot of water inside it.\n\n\nThis time, when coming into the island they get caught up in a firefight and lose control of their boat. After trying to find their way back on board, they realize that they are actually on a mountain.\n\n\nThe next thing they have is to get back the way they came. This is what drives them to explore. They eventually get into a battle with a bunch of orcs and a giant spider and are eventually rescued when people show up in a boat. They're not going to make it to the town, but they do make it to the city gates to try and find their own way out.\n\n\nOnce they find their way out, they try to start walking towards the gate, but one of them is being followed by an orc. After a bit of fighting between the two, the orcs realize that the two are really good friends and go the other way. The girl and guy stay behind as one of the locals uses the sword they have in a fight to stab an orc straight through the heart.\n\n\nThey then leave the city without a moment's hesitation. I'm not an expert on movies, but I'm guessing the film was at around 90 minutes. Maybe they were pushing it because the film isn't even out yet and it really seems rushed. Either way, the end credits tell us that we'll be able to see this movie again sometime in 2012 after it's done. I'm hoping this time they did a better job at capturing the essence of the game and added some story to it. We will see.\n\n\nI really hope this movie is up to snuff. The gameplay and the characters in it make the game really unique and it was a truly memorable experience. Even if this one was just a short clip, I would still be pleased.\n\n\nIt's not exactly sure what it's intended to be when you play it, other than to make you look at the game for the very long time you did.\n\n\nThe trailers weren't too bad, too bad you don't have a trailer like that.\n\n\nIt seemed like the camera that was used really pushed the action. The first one was very much like those old action-packed 80s and 90s movies.\n\n\nYou know it was a fun ride\n\n\nSo there you have it, the end of the last video. Hope you liked reading that and I hope I didn't miss anything important.\n\n\nOh, and it looks like the trailers have been updated, so go give those a look as well.",
      "The \"Paleo-Dairy Diet\" is one of the most popular paleo dietary guidelines. It is the way to eat and get fat, for sure.\n\nThis is also the way to get skinny. I am no body coach or trainer so I can't really speak to how this would work in other circumstances. But one of the easiest ways to get skinny in your current situation is to go on a \"paleo-dairy-diet\". I know, it sounds awful but trust me on this one, it works. It gets you in the \"lean-muscle-muscle\" phase where you can really lose fat, get muscular, and get very lean. It is simple; eat meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, and fruits and veggies to your heart's content, and it's all done easily. Even better, you can get into the \"skinny-muscle-muscle\" phase (where you lose fat and get leaner) in no time.\n\nYou have a choice to make here. If you are a meat eater who has never gone on a paleo-dairy-diet, then there is no reason to continue eating meat. Eat as many lean meats as you like but do not eat any dairy products, nuts, beans, cheese, or anything else you think of as \"paleo\". Your paleo-dairy-diet is going to work fine. My advice would be to not worry about it.\n\nIf you are a fish. . .well, now you have some options. If you are a fish eater, you can still go on a paleo-dairy-diet too. Fish may be \"paleo\". But if you have access to salmon and trout, go for it. There is no guarantee that these foods are \"paleo\". So if you are fish eater and you have access to salmon or trout, that goes too. If you are not fish eater, there are no restrictions on the meat you can eat, as long as you do not get too lean. That's it. Don't worry, you can still have fish, yogurt, and pizza too.\n\nWhen we go paleo, we generally only stick to our meat diet since the rest is up for debate, as are other foods. But we also need to get into the \"skinny-muscle-muscle\" phase, where we lose some weight, and we probably get into the \"lean-muscle-muscle\" phase too. So just because we don't eat cheese and nuts for a few weeks, that doesn't mean we don't eat those things and it won't help get us to where we want to be. That's why this is a very important diet change. So just do it, and remember, you don't have to eat chicken breasts, pork chops and chicken wings any longer because they weren't \"paleo\" for whatever reason.\n\nI also want to point out that I am not saying that we should all be on a \"paleo-dairy-diet\". I know a lot of people who can eat meat and fish and who don't necessarily have the stomach for it. However, the people who really get into the paleo-dairy-diet and are able to lose those excess body fat and get leaner. . .that is the most awesome.",
      "\"To all of you who care about the people of Baltimore and Baltimore City, I hear you,\" Hogan said. \"What I hear is that you are hurting and desperate for help. I hear you and I want to help.\"\n\nAs a mayor, Hogan was known as a reformer, championing several important initiatives like creating Baltimore's first state-led health-care exchange, investing in green energy initiatives, and opening Baltimore City's Inner Harbor to the public for walking tours. When Hogan entered politics, there was much talk about how he could continue some of his reforms. Now, two years later, the question is is whether he can carry them forward.\n\nHogan did not make clear what specific reforms the state would support, but he also signaled that the state would be looking for ways to expand Medicaid under President Barack Obama's reform. The expansion of Medicaid will save about a million Marylanders their health insurance, so the state may want to support that effort as well.\n\nHogan's announcement came before a panel discussion on \"The Rising Tide: How Baltimore City is Turning the Tide Against Poverty,\" attended by community organizers, Baltimore City Council members, and public-health professionals from throughout Maryland. Hogan's announcement came before a panel discussion on \"The Rising Tide: How Baltimore City is Turning the Tide Against Poverty,\" attended by community organizers, Baltimore City Council members, and public-health professionals from throughout Maryland.\n\nIn an interview with The Intercept after the panel, Jim Graham, who served as the director of Maryland Advancement Network before becoming Baltimore City's public health commissioner, praised Hogan for trying to tackle many of the community's main issues. Graham, who has been instrumental in bringing attention to the need for improved public health outcomes (including the health of the inner-city population), said the public health community was not particularly surprised by Hogan's move, but he hoped that the governor would put forward new approaches to fight the opioid and substance abuse crisis.\n\n\"We've had a tremendous amount of success,\" Graham said. But Graham said that while the state must continue to support initiatives like expansion of Medicaid, the state must do more. \"At some point, there seems to be a point where we have to step up. This should be a place to start.\"\n\nGraham, who previously worked on a national initiative to fight childhood diseases caused by tobacco, said he believed that Hogan would work with \"the right people at the right time\" so that progress could be made. (Since last month's announcement, Hogan's office announced that the governor was nominating Katherine C. McTernan, the former Maryland health commissioner, to be the first commissioner-at-large of Baltimore County Public Health Services . Hogan's office did not immediately confirm the nomination as of this announcement.)\n\nHogan is working to bolster the health of Baltimore City's poor, working to make sure that people are able to gain access to healthy, affordable food and healthy, affordable access to medical care. This includes making sure that residents aren't forced to move out of the city due to rising costs.\n\nHogan's proposal would allow the county to participate in the Healthy Families Grant Program, which offers grants to health centers and public health agencies that serve low-income households. To date, just 40 percent of health providers located in Baltimore City have been eligible for the grant. The remainder come from other counties and cities.\n\nThe Healthy Families Grant Program's goal is to help health care providers provide family-planning services, prevention-related services and other reproductive health and related services to low-income residents living in Baltimore City. These services are often unaffordable for some residents, who might have trouble affording regular visits to clinics and physicians.\n\nHogan said that the state will be offering the grant program for just the first two years of 2018 and 2019. Although the program is relatively new, it had already proven to be wildly successful in Maryland during its first two years.\n\nTo promote the program, the Baltimore City Health Department created \"the Healthy Johns Hopkins Baltimore\" website for Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University Hospitals. A \"Choose Healthy Hopkins Baltimore\" campaign also provides healthy food options and healthy lifestyle and nutrition goals for Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins students.\n\nWhile the Healthy Johns Hopkins Baltimore website is limited to Baltimore City residents, the Healthy Johns Hopkins Baltimore website is not limited to residents of the city, but rather people on Maryland Medicaid and Baltimore City families eligible for the Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe Healthy Johns Hopkins Baltimore website aims to provide information about free or low-cost or free-of-charge health care services within and without the Baltimore City Health Department offices. The website highlights services like healthy cookouts, support groups, and community nutrition education, and it also lists free or reduced-price health-care clinics in the Baltimore City area.\n\nThere are also a great number of resources available on the Healthy Johns Hopkins Baltimore website to help people access health-care services, including the State of Maryland Health Insurance Marketplace, and various providers from the University",
      "For a new series of articles looking at what our modern lives have in common with those of our ancestors, we're looking at the latest in technology: the laptop computer.\n\nIt was once a simple piece of technology, a simple mechanical device that was only meant for one task and was never meant to last. Today though, the laptop computer is one of the most important consumer products of the last half century. A laptop allows you to get work done on your own terms at your own pace. This article will explore how computing has evolved in the last 60 years. The laptop computer is now a multi-functional device, offering many of the functions you can perform on a desktop computer for considerably less.\n\nWhat Was the Past?\n\nThe first laptop computers began to appear in 1970. These low-cost, single-task computers were originally sold in bookstores and retail stores, but quickly found their way into office buildings as computers installed for those who were short of office space or needed to be left alone.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, laptop computers were seen as a simple, practical, and inexpensive way to get work done while using less office space.\n\nBy about the mid-1980s, laptops began to find their way into more areas of American society. These computers would be used as work computers by people in the workplace and the home for reading, email, Internet surfing, and the like. With the rise of desktop computers, laptops began to appear in more everyday environments as well, including the classroom.\n\nIn the last 10 years, we've seen laptops go from an inexpensive way of getting work done, to a multi-vendor computer system used by anyone to create applications, perform various online activities, and store and sync data. The laptop has become one of the most popular and important consumer electronic devices, and has had a profound impact on our world in every way.\n\nToday's Laptop Computer - More Than Just a Desktops Computer\n\nToday's laptops are much bigger than the ones that were popular in the 1970s, and feature the same types of components. They are larger and heavier than single-task computers, but in some cases they are even larger than desktops from the same era.\n\nLaptop computers are also used for many more activities, and now have more functions and functions than desktop computers did when they were first released. The list of functions they can perform is virtually limitless, but we will talk about three big areas today. It is likely that you've heard of at least one of the functions, but we'll give you a rundown of a few additional applications and features.\n\nEmail\n\nEmail was a new concept when people began using laptops in the 1980s. It wasn't that people didn't want to be able to send and receive email on their computers, but it was a lot more convenient to do it on a computer screen than on an office printer or personal computer. A computer in the home, office, or elsewhere that had the ability to send and receive email would have been extremely useful, and in many ways a big breakthrough for modern life.\n\nAs desktop computer capabilities grew, laptops quickly became integrated with other computer systems. The laptops and desktop computers would communicate through their serial ports, thus making a whole suite of email programs possible. Today, the vast majority of emails you receive are sent and received with a laptop by an email program, and most of those programs are built for the laptop's serial port connectivity.\n\nThe Laptop Computer and Internet\n\nMuch like email, there is a lot of value in an easy way to access and read the Internet, but it is not necessary for most people in these days and ages. The Web today is as much or more of an important tool in daily life as it was in the late 1990s. As you can see from this diagram, which we created as a way of showing how the different parts of the Internet were all integrated into today's Internet, a laptop (in our example, a Lenovo IdeaPad 900) is essentially a small computer with a monitor and a keyboard.\n\nIn recent years, smartphones with built-in web browsers have become more and more common, and a laptop with a built-in web browser can bring the Internet to any computer with a serial port. In these days and ages, a small laptop with a built-in web browser provides one of the best ways to access the Internet.\n\nWeb browsing\n\nWeb browsing was another new function of the 1980s that allowed computers to act as online computers for reading information on the net. As you might have guessed, the word \"web\" refers to this concept, but the word \"web browser\" is a popular way of describing this type of computer that lets you browse the web by using your computer's keyboard and display. In the early days of computer operating systems, the term \"web browser\" was used to refer to any computer system that would allow you to read text on a web page. Today's web browser is almost completely",

      "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: The Senate has voted to end a ban on U.S.-made arms sales to Colombia—a move that had been expected for weeks. The Senate also voted to extend the U.S. War in Afghanistan through the end of 2016. The votes came hours after a New York Times report said American defense firms have been pushing the Congress to lift the arms embargo on the country for years. The Times report detailed the campaign of American lobby groups for more arms sales to Colombia. President Obama has been a major supporter of the embargo.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos received a boost Tuesday from former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden helped broker a historic peace deal in Colombia. Biden said Colombia's peace deal will open new opportunities for U.S. firms to resume production there.\n\nPRESIDENT JOSÉ SANTOS: (through translator) As I said at the conclusion of the negotiations that took place this summer with our friend Joe, I want to state clearly: The United States guarantees that Colombia will meet the commitments that were made. We reaffirm our commitment to respect human rights and democracy in Colombia, and our commitment to promoting a sustainable peace in Colombia. That said, the decision will remain with the Colombian people. We will respect that decision, because the people will not be able to make that decision alone. It will take support, and we have made our support clear in Colombia today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The new U.S.-Colombia military agreement does not include a ban on the U.S. military's use of U.S.-made military aircraft such as the Black Hawk helicopters, which are manufactured with parts from the United States. This is Biden.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: (Through translation) What was done in Colombia today will be of great benefit to all of us. I hope it will bring a strong outcome. I want to thank all those involved. I want to thank the Colombian people for their support of this important and historic decision, and we look forward to continuing to work together with the Colombian people to support their effort to achieve peace and stability, which will help the United States to expand exports to Colombia and to bring jobs and economic growth to this wonderful country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined by two guests. Juan Manuel Santos is Colombia's president. He addressed the Senate, before the vote on the embargo, urging members not to let Congress end the arms embargo on the country.\n\nJUAN MANUEL SANTOS: (translated) They are calling for a resolution that will not be implemented. I am asking them to stand by the commitment we made in 2002, as one of the original authors, together with the international community, and allow the U.S. military to continue to make its contribution to combatting the terrorist groups that are operating in Colombia. We ask them to recognize that this will give us a chance to continue to fight those terrorist groups who are operating in this country. This is a question of survival… We had to make a decision. We had decided to sign a peace accord. We are not in the position to change that. However, we are asking the U.S. to continue to support with its military the fight against the Colombian military forces that are fighting with respect for human rights and democracy, so that we can help transform the military base that was there with respect to the Colombian military that, we can help, we can allow the Colombians to build a new economy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, for more, we're joined by José Miguel Vivanco, former vice president of Colombia, now director of Global Exchange. He's also the author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness in the United States.\n\nJOSE MIGUEL VANDO: Good afternoon, and good morning, and good evening. I'm Jose Miguel Vivanco. I have a question for you.\n\nNow we have a U.S. government official, an official of the State Department and the Defense Department, talking about the fact that there are some provisions in the new agreement so that they will continue to operate, operate in this country, that there is no question. A few months ago, they said that these activities that were prohibited under the embargo will be carried out. Now they're saying that it is only in those elements. But, in fact, the U.S. has the ability to continue to do that. The fact is, the U.S. is the largest purchaser of Colombian military equipment, even though it had a prohibition against doing this before.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you respond?\n\nJOSE MIGUEL VANDO: What we cannot afford to do is give the U.S. credit for the fact that it allows its military bases to continue to operate. What we must not",
      "\"You're not going to let me do a better job? OK…\" he grumbles in a way that makes the hair on your arms stand on end. \"And you're not paying me more?\"\n\nThat's exactly the line he is going to use when he tells the public that if they want him as CEO of Verizon it has to pay a \"good chunk more\" for his services.\n\nThe guy is about to unleash a full-blown, over-the-top war of words on you, me, and everyone who has ever told another person they couldn't get along with him.\n\nBut it's not a war he is going to win. He knows that.\n\nBut he also knows, for two reasons, this is probably not the smartest move ever made by someone who is not really going to win this battle.\n\nReason #1: People will love him more for it\n\nWhy would anyone pay more money for what is ostensibly a \"better\" experience in a mobile phone service when they also get what they already have? The old adage about who pays the piper is about to be put to the test as more Verizon customers find out what their new boss is really up to and how he is willing to take a few more pennies to win.\n\nOne of the things that sets Verizon apart is that it has a very loyal customer following, and that is what makes this move so foolish. He has already gone on the offensive, and the people who love him won't stop cheering him on.\n\nVerizon customers love big data. Verizon customers also love a great customer service staff with a knack for helping people who want them to help them. In fact, according to The Huffington Post, Verizon's recent job postings for customer service reps were for the most qualified people that want to work for them. So much the better for Verizon's marketing department to think that they have a good record with keeping its customers happy when there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that's the case.\n\nSo in his latest speech, he's going to have to do a few things very carefully. He has to convince people to pay more for more Verizon. Then he has to show him with evidence that he has achieved the improvement he is going for.\n\nThe first two goals have already been reached. But he is not going to be able to convince people that's what Verizon is all about. After all, there are lots and lots of companies with \"better service\" and plenty of people out there that love them.\n\nReason #2: He won't really win\n\nAnd this is another reason he might not have thought things through the way he does, because his \"better\" phone service might not really be better at all. There is a lot of data that it's actually worse.\n\nSome of that is because Verizon's cell phone services are not much different than the ones offered by its competitors even though they have the same name and that's one of the biggest factors in all of this.\n\nTake Verizon's new, unlimited service. When it was first introduced, Verizon claimed that the new service gave customers \"unlimited\" mobile data. What it wasn't telling customers was how that data was actually used. In a study released in March 2013, New America Foundation found that Verizon's data plans used on the new unlimited mobile data service were \"exceptionally overpriced compared to comparable plans in the U.S. economy.\" In other words, consumers were paying far too much for \"unlimited\" data and Verizon could have kept their existing Verizon data plans.\n\nThen there are other, deeper flaws in Verizon's network as well. Earlier this year, American Customer Satisfaction Index analyzed Verizon's network's wireless speeds as compared to average speeds in the U.S. And the data showed that Verizon service was slower than the national average when compared to average speeds nationwide in 2012 as well as Verizon's own \"speed tests.\" And the same study showed that Verizon's data speeds have been on the decline in terms of a higher percent of customers reporting that their service speeds dropped below 3 Mbps between 2011 and 2012, according to Verizon's own information.\n\nThose two tests show that Verizon is not improving its service, and that the people that have it now don't even want it to improve and their quality of service has deteriorated. So it's obvious to everyone watching that for a company to claim they are going to make a significant difference in their customers' experience over their competitors in the mobile phone business is kind of like saying they are going to dramatically increase the number of Nobel Prizes for science as they go along.\n\nBut in order to get people to give Verizon more money to improve it, he has some other tricks to play. But those tricks may prove to be ineffective as well.\n\nFor starters, it's probably not going to be that easy. The guy is going to say that \"We did the best we could,\" but in terms of actual improvement, he may not",

      "MEMORANDUM FOR THE SENATE\n\nRe: S. 1785, the \"Medicine Choice and Privacy Act of 2017\"\n\nDear Senator Heller:\n\nThe United States Conference of Mayors is pleased to join with other leaders of public policy organizations in urging you not to support the \"Medicine Choice and Privacy Act of 2017\" (S. 1785).\n\nThe bill, which was introduced by Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), would undermine your longstanding commitment to the principle of personal privacy and medical freedom. As president of the Mayors' Conference, I want you to know how dismayed we are about this legislation. No matter what the merits, S. 1785 would turn back the clock on decades of personal care and privacy advances, and, as a result, would significantly restrict access to affordable medical care for America's children and low-income and vulnerable communities.\n\nIn the nearly two decades I've been in the health care field, I have witnessed the tremendous progress that has been made in health care, as we have addressed the challenges of modernizing health care in the face of rising costs, increasing access, and reducing costs for our families and children. When you take away insurance choices and limit medical care, you take opportunities away from our entire nation and harm patients, families, and the entire health care system as a whole.\n\nAs president of Mayors' Conference, we also believe that federal legislation in this area should be driven by evidence and not by ideology. In this regard, the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association oppose the \"Medicine Choice and Privacy Act of 2017.\"\n\nAs we have watched the evolution of the ACA in light of the challenges it has faced, we have seen firsthand why the \"Medicine Choice and Privacy Act of 2017\" is a misguided approach. We have witnessed the way in which the ACA forced insurers to limit patients and doctors' options in regard to how they chose to spend their health care dollars, which in turn put doctors and patient autonomy at risk.\n\nS. 1785 will not improve the quality of care for Americans. Instead, it has the potential to worsen the lives of many Americans suffering from serious diseases who need access to high quality and affordable health care.\n\nThe \"Medicine Choice and Privacy Act of 2017\" would also undermine our efforts to improve health outcomes and prevent preventable morbidity and mortality in our neighborhoods, our children's schools, and our elderly population.\n\nWhile we do not believe that all insurance plans should exist, we do believe that certain types of personal health insurance should exist to ensure health and well being in our nation for all citizens. We believe that the Affordable Care Act and the state-based insurance marketplaces designed to help individuals purchase health insurance constitute some of our nation's most successful strategies for helping to ensure the health and well-being of our nation's families and children. S. 1785 would undo most of these improvements to this landscape, including the Medicaid expansion available through the ACA, which is widely recognized by a growing majority of our nation's citizens to have benefited our entire nation.\n\nThe health care system faces many challenges that need to be addressed to enable our nation to maintain its place as the global leader in the medical care we provide. While we have made great strides in recent years, we must not forget that we still have a long way to go, particularly in reducing the rate of illness and disease and the rising cost of health care. It is critical that we provide our nation's children with the best possible health care, regardless of their income, social status, or health condition.\n\nWe urge you to oppose S. 1785 and take the steps to protect America's families' and children's health and well-being.",
      "\"They've had it up to here with me, and now they've put a price on my head.\"\n\n- The Collector speaking to his captive\n\nThe \"Exotic Weapons\" Collector is a character in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.\n\nContents show]\n\nBiography Edit\n\nThe Collector is a ruthless creature, who appears to be an artificial intelligence. He also appears to have a good relationship with the Collectors he holds captive: he is even willing to trade them with the other races for their support during the Reaper war. However, he has been known to show contempt for Cerberus and even against them. In addition, he is shown to be extremely impatient and short-tempered, despite the fact that he has a good relationship with the other races that he holds captive.\n\nBiography Edit\n\nMass Effect 2 Edit\n\nThis section takes place during the First Contact with the Collectors.\n\n\nWhen a team of humans under Commander Shepard's command arrives at the Collector colony of Rannoch, they witness a man in full armor, apparently a member of the Kett, attempting to kill the Collector queen. He is shot and killed by a gunner, but this is quickly followed by a series of attacks from many Collectors.\n\nAfter the Queen is killed, Commander Shepard discovers the alien race responsible for the attack. The Collectors are being hunted down by the Reapers and Commander Shepard, who believes a cure may be found on the Citadel, begins to dispatch Crucible-class ships and Prothean beams to collect information and weapons from the Collectors and bring back to the Citadel for study.\n\nDuring the first two visits, two more human survivors (an Ensign and a Tech) are killed in combat by the Collectors. Shepard finds a wounded Krogan, who was shot by one of the Collectors. He will tell Shepard about how the Kett killed him, while his squad mate and friend, Kasumi, is being held captive by the Collectors. Shepard must either talk the Kett out of trying to hold Kasumi or convince the Enforcer to turn against them. Either way, he will allow Shepard to free Kasumi. Shepard can persuade the Collector to free Kasumi, or alternatively, the Enforcer to give in. If either side of the fight with the Collector is not successful, Kasumi will not come out.\n\nAfter the second visit, Kasumi will find Shepard, and Shepard can get her out or she will refuse to come out. If Shepard attempts to attack the Collector Queen with force, the queen will attack back and Shepard will have to battle all four enemy combatants.\n\nAfter the fight with the Queen has ended, Shepard can find Kasumi, who has broken free from the Collector hold, and is being chased by Collector pursuers. She will not come out, and Shepard can either allow her to fight alongside the Krogan she was sent to rescue, shoot all the Collectors in sight to let her out or allow the remaining Collector and human survivors to make off. She will eventually come out to fight alongside Commander Shepard in a final battle against the Collectors.\n\nMass Effect 3 Edit\n\nThis section takes place during the Third Ark.\n\n\nUpon first contact with the Collector queen in the ruins of the Collector base, the galaxy's two greatest military academies come into conflict. Upon learning of the threat of the Reapers, Cerberus sends a Crucible-class ship to retrieve samples from the Collectors. As the ship comes into range of Rannoch, however, it suddenly breaks away and crashes into the moon's surface. After getting out of the shuttle, Shepard is greeted by Lieutenant Xytan Raal, who gives Shepard the mission of escorting Admiral Hackett's team to the Citadel and securing the samples for shipment.\n\nLater, in a conversation with Kasumi, he informs her that the Collectors have no interest in humans as allies, although he does seem somewhat curious about Commander Shepard himself.\n\nWhen Shepard finally reaches the Citadel, he meets up with Hackett, who has just completed a ritual to revive Miranda Lawson from the dead, as well as retrieving the ancient data disk used to save her. The data disk is located in the Citadel's Data Vault, and Shepard must retrieve the disk or die trying. Upon reaching the Data Vault, Shepard finds a door sealed from the inside, and must either hack it to break the seal or fight through Reapers to get to it. Upon hacking the door, Shepard discovers that the only way to get out of the Data Vault is to activate a button on the wall which opens a hatch inside the Data Vault, revealing it as a prison for all of the Reapers (who were sealed in the data vault as well). Shepard must fight the Reapers and the Collectors inside, as well as their leader, an AI who serves as the base's controller. During the final confrontation, Shepard can kill the Collectors, but does not kill the Collector queen.\n",
      "Bart Simpson: The Simpson's are back!\n\nJust because you haven't seen the long-awaited season 18 premiere of The Simpsons doesn't mean there isn't plenty to love from the new season. Here's my breakdown on every episode.\n\nSimpson's Dilemma\n\nSimpson's Dilemma is the episode that shows when the team has been down in the dumps for too long, but don't just focus on the bad times, there are always good times, too! It's the episode we've been waiting for, and I can't tell you how happy I am that it finally aired!\n\nThis episode starts out on a positive note, with the Simpson's making an announcement to their neighbors, the citizens of Springfield (and their relatives and friends), of how bad the Simpsons are being treated at the hands of the mayor and the city government. The mayor has been trying to find the culprit for the Simpson's missing money and money has a tendency to stay at his side. It's funny seeing him try to prove he cares by doing things like paying off the mortgage before the family leaves for vacation, making a $100,000 donation for charity, telling the city council he'd be happy to put up their money, and taking a bribe. Of course, we all know that the truth of these tales come around, and we all know that it wasn't the mayor himself that took the bribe, it was his pet rat! I can't wait for the episode to be released!\n\nThe Marge vs. the Monorail\n\nI know some people hated this episode, but I had to share it with you because it looks as if the Marge Simpson has taken on a super villain character from the comic books! The Marge Simpson vs. the Monorail is a super awesome episode and it will make you smile like a crazy old lady. This episode also has a fantastic scene where Marge realizes that there is no way the Monorail could make her family's flight to Europe and take them safely. Instead, Marge decides to use a little bit of her secretarial skills to find a way to get her family home safely, but it turns out that these new ways will be even more complicated than she thought!\n\nA Very Special Episode\n\nThis episode is one of my favorite episodes of The Simpsons and it takes everything I love about the show (funny, wonderful characters, awesome music, comedy!) and crushes it into one epic episode! I can tell you already that you should watch this episode because it's amazing and I can't wait to see it when it airs sometime next year.\n\nBart the Daredevil\n\nI'm a huge fan of the Simpsons and if you don't agree, you just aren't watching the show right. Bart's story in Season 15 (and Season 17, depending on when you watch your favorite episode) really gave all of that comedy to the show and I couldn't be more happy to see this episode aired next year (on Fox) and on Netflix and Hulu! Bart and his friends must have been on their way to work the day they came home from a long journey, when they were attacked by an angry man outside of their house. I had an amazing time watching this episode with my family, who all had fun laughing while I was just looking up on meek eyes at Bart's face. One of my favorite moments in this episode was when Lisa decided to put a \"Save The Simpsons\" sign outside of Bart's house and it's hilarious to see.\n\nSimpson and Delilah\n\nSimpson and Delilah is probably one of my favorite episodes of The Simpsons and it makes me happy that there is still an episode called when we can watch The Simpson's again! I know what you are like, \"Who is Delilah?\" Well, it turns out that she is the girl that Bart dated in the movie, The Beethoven Complex. And what was Bart's reaction to her?\n\n\"Yeah! Oh my God, I could never get her to go out with me!\" \"Awww,\" Delilah giggled, \"she must be so lonely!\" And then Bart had a moment of clarity and realized that it was him, not Delilah, whose \"lonely\" side he was missing! That's what we need to see the next time we watch The Simpsons and see the real Bart Simpson out there!\n\nI Am Furious\n\nWhen we watch this episode, we're shown some of everything you can possibly hope to see in a season 18 episode: a family getting out of debt by getting an apartment, a woman losing her job because a man can't understand her, Bart getting on the bus, Lisa wanting her dad out of business and then a truck crashing into the family's home. The episode is filled with humor and just a ton of laughs!! If any Simpsons fans see this and haven't seen it yet, go watch the season 15 episode right now!\n\n",

      "When he became commissioner, Jeffery Lurie signed off on a wide-ranging change that changed the way the Eagles used analytics. He didn't want to run an inefficient offense in the NFL again.\n\nHis first major change was eliminating the \"pivoting\" system. When a new offensive coordinator would be hired, he'd move to the other side of the ball. To keep track of everything a coach had to learn at all times, offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur would send all of the defensive playbooks to the analytics department. So while the Eagles were making the switch to a more balanced offense last year that featured run and pass, each coordinator would have a different set of playbooks as well.\n\nThe Eagles also adopted the \"fade as you go\" system. On every offensive snap, the playcaller would run through the play in a series of steps, with plays being run at different speeds. The idea was to keep the offense from becoming predictable and predictable opponents would be able to throw to each receiver. But the \"fade as you go\" system had other downsides.\n\nIn some cases, the Eagles' receivers were being called for false steps so the quarterback still had his base reads and could adjust the route at the line, which could lead to an easy interception. That was one of the reasons why the Eagles signed receivers DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin this offseason. And it's why the Eagles traded for Torrey Smith from Baltimore.\n\nSo the next time you find yourself asking why a team isn't using a specific term, here are a few reasons.\n\n1) They Just Don't See the Need.\n\nThis is a more general term for the old-school approach where the \"coaches don't want to learn about analytics because they're afraid it'll get in their way.\" When you look at some of the coaches who have tried to make the switch, it seems like it's been their one way or the highway. And so they don't want to see anyone else using a specific system.\n\nFor example, when the Rams hired former Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano to be their new head coach, his first move was to institute the \"pivoting\" system.\n\n\"It's not that we have a problem,\" Schiano said. \"It's that we've come to realize we don't make it. ... We are not in the business of looking outside in to other systems. We are in the business of looking for answers from inside out and finding what answers are to make our football teams better.\"\n\nWhen the Vikings tried the \"fade as you go\" system in 2011, they got burned by Peyton Manning. Then they got burned by Andrew Luck. In 2013, they got killed again, this time by Drew Brees.\n\nOf course, even if you believe they haven't been burned, the reality is they might not have the personnel to succeed with the fade system. They used the system to great effect in Philadelphia last year and were rewarded by having one of the top three offenses in the NFL. But there are few running backs to throw the ball to, not many wide receivers and not much of a tight end.\n\nSo if not for some free-agent acquisitions, the Vikings could have spent all of their offseason upgrading on the football side. They drafted a receiver in April, signed an offensive tackle in May and traded for two key offensive weapons this last month.\n\nIf the Vikings were using the fade system, that would be the reason for their lack of success.\n\n2) The System Is Hard to Learn.\n\nThe old system might be easier to learn than the new system. It might be more efficient to run than the other systems. And you don't have to be taught in order to learn. But for many teams in the NFL, it's not really practical because of the lack of depth in the league - or in the coaching ranks - to allow someone to learn that system from scratch.\n\nAt least not yet.\n\nIf there's any area where they want to make a big jump in 2014 - especially when it comes to the analytics - it probably will come with the addition of personnel analysts into the coaching ranks. Because of that, they will need to have a good grasp of a bunch of different areas. But they don't have the personnel to do so.\n\nThe reason the Vikings have been so successful with the fade system is that it has allowed their top quarterback to be their top playcaller. With that system in place, you can't blame the quarterback for learning. He's being asked to read a lot of different coverages and reacting quickly. If not for that, he would be a lot more predictable than he is now.\n\n3) An Offense in a Nutshell\n\nThink about a football team like the Eagles' the way you picture a car.\n\nIn a car, a car comes equipped with a driver. A driver can use a manual transmission. Or",
      "This study examines the relationship between the consumption of alcohol and sexual behavior over the life course.\n\nThis article seeks to answer what is known about alcohol's effect on sexual behavior (sexual risk taking, alcohol's impact on sexual satisfaction, the extent of sexual risk taking, and drinking and sexual initiation) by examining the time series of drinking episodes, the frequency of sexual activity, and alcohol consumption and satisfaction within men and women, over the course of their adult lives.\n\nThe main goal of this study was to examine drinking-associated sexual risk taking over the life course, and alcohol's impact on sexual activity over the life course; to examine drinking-related sexual risk taking and sexual satisfaction in different populations (e.g., college students, low- versus high-risk college students, and heterosexual and homosexual men and women); to examine the extent to which the relationship of drinking and sexual activity with each other can be explained in part by individual differences in sexual risk taking and satisfaction; and to examine the extent to which sexual risk taking and satisfaction can be explained in part by individual differences in sexual desire, sexual behavior, and sexual satisfaction. In addition to drinking and sexual risk taking, we explored other drinking-related behaviors (e.g., drinking episodes, drinking frequency, age at first drink, and age at first sexual intercourse).\n\nWe were able to find only two cross-sectional studies using this methodology. The first was conducted in the United States from 1979. This study, which is about the effect of the alcohol consumption, was limited to males, was based on a relatively small number of participants, and is not known with certainty to be representative of the general population. The second study, which is an ongoing cohort study conducted across the United States, involved approximately 5,500 men aged thirty-five to forty-nine. This study was about the impact of alcohol on sexual behavior, and included both a longitudinal analysis of sexual behavior with a two-way analysis of variance and a correlational analysis of sexual activity.\n\nA study, which has been underway since 1991, is an ongoing longitudinal sample study of male college students. The present article explores the impact of alcohol consumption on sexual risk taking and sexual satisfaction over the life course. We also examine the extent to which sexual risk taking and sexual satisfaction can be explained in part by individual differences in sexual risk taking and sexual satisfaction.\n\nOne might think that a study examining sexual risk-taking and sexual satisfaction could be readily conducted since it is difficult to find a study that does not ask these questions, but we have not found a study that uses this methodology. Two years on, we are still trying to find one or two other existing studies that do ask such questions. One may suspect that these other studies fail to detect that a high proportion of males, regardless of ethnic background or income, are drinkers and that therefore they lack a sufficient range of sample sizes to obtain statistically significant results. Indeed, one might believe that this hypothesis would be confirmed if a higher proportion of drinkers participated in a study about sexual risk taking than did non-drinkers, as is known to have been the case prior to 1989. However, the majority of studies involving samples of this size do not reveal differences between men who are and are not alcohol dependent.\n\nIn the remainder of this article, and in the following sections on alcohol consumption and satisfaction (preliminary results), we discuss the limitations of studies that have relied on a single measure of sexual risk taking or sexual satisfaction (with one exception). Next, we discuss the evidence from the study of college students that focuses on the impact of alcohol consumption on sexual risk taking and sexual satisfaction. We also discuss the evidence from the study of low- versus high-risk college students concerning sexual risk taking, sexual satisfaction and drinking behavior, and drinking habits over the course of college.\n\nFor example, a study on the impact of drinking on sexual risk taking, or sexual behavior, might ask, \"At what age did you first get drunk for sexual reasons?\" or \"How many hours of drinking did you engage in for sexual purposes?\" Some studies do ask these questions. However, most do not since such questions do not provide the right context for the question. Another advantage of measuring sexual risk taking over the course of a lifetime is that it allows the question, \"How many times did you get drunk for sexual purposes during your life?\"\n\nA limitation of this research design may be the limited range of outcomes that can be studied due to the lack of a longitudinally collected data set. Most studies of alcohol and sexual risk taking over the life course use a cross-sectional approach where participants are asked to recall their drinking patterns over the course of their adult lives, and these data may therefore not be longitudinal.\n\nWith most cross-sectional studies, these questions are asked with people aged thirty or thirty-five years old. With most longitudinal studies, participants are asked either about their drinking history (e.g., how many drinks did you drink every day during your adult life and how many drinks on which",
      "The Canadian Press\n\n\nVANCOUVER - The NDP's pledge to review the Canada Pension Plan, which will be debated in Parliament in the fall, will not result in automatic tax increases for Canadians, NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair said Wednesday.\n\nMulcair made the announcement at a Vancouver community centre, where thousands of people were attending a health and social service day. Many of the attendees were seniors who were concerned about seniors' rights under the Conservatives' first budget that included a tax increase on old age security as well as the CPP.\n\nMulcair would not say whether the NDP's support to the CPP, which currently only benefits higher earners, would be automatic in future, despite previous NDP promises to make a review of the system a requirement if the party forms government.\n\nBut he said the issue was one he would discuss in more detail at a campaign stop Thursday in Vancouver at a seniors' home.\n\n\"We have our own pension plan ... And that's a very important point,\" he said.\n\nNDP Leader Tom Mulcair is promising to end the Conservative government's proposed two-tier CPP plan, which would have kept the current maximum yearly contribution of $15,700, but would have made lower earners contributing less. The Conservatives' budget also included a tax increase on the Canada Pension Plan. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\nIf Mulcair won a majority government after the Sept. 18 election, he would have to present proposals for a transition to full CPP.\n\nA spokesman for finance Minister Joe Oliver responded to Mulcair's comments by saying the Conservatives' first budget, released on Tuesday, includes a plan to \"review and modernize\" the Canada Pension Plan.\n\n\"Under Stephen Harper the Conservatives promised to increase the CPP and the Old Age Security Trust Fund by $30 billion a year,\" said Conservative spokesman Nicolas Marceau. \"It's time for Stephen Harper to follow through on his promises to Canadians.\"\n\nLiberal candidate and veterans affairs critic Gabriel Gagnon said he's concerned about CPP changes under the Liberals due to a change to the income test for OAS payments, which affects those who make less than $55,000 a year.\n\n\"I have a great concern for people who work for a living who are struggling under these kind of changes and are not able to provide for themselves,\" he said.\n\n\"This isn't about politics, it's about the Canadian people and the fact that Stephen Harper has put forward the wrong strategy to create employment and prosperity.\n\n\"We won't get the job done unless we stop Stephen Harper,\" Gagnon added.",
      "On September 2nd 2014, I had the opportunity to play through the last remaining mission of the original Fallout 3. I did this because Fallout 4 was released before Fallout 3 and because I wanted to play through it for the first time in almost 10 years. I finished Fallout 3, and I am left really wanting for another piece of the Fallout 3 world. Fallout 3 was my favorite Fallout game to play in the first place, in part due to the fact that I played through the final mission for the first time in nearly ten years. It did however leave me with one significant question:\n\n\n\"Where did the player characters go?\"\n\nAs a fan of the series and a game enthusiast, I am more interested in finding a satisfying answer to this question, and to know where did our favorite characters go. I found that Fallout 3 left something out of my original theory that the player characters left Vault 111, as well as a key part of the ending.\n\nThere are a few places that I think that the player characters went. First of all, I believe it to be confirmed that the player characters left the vault after completing the quest to kill Father Elijah for the Vault Dweller's memoirs. Elijah was the only person in Vault 111 who knew about the diary. As far as I am aware, it was his diary that they were after.\n\nFurthermore, the Brotherhood of Steel and the Institute are still around. However, I believe they have not been seen since the beginning of the game. From what I can gather from reading many other fan theories, the Brotherhood of Steel was disbanded around the time that Elijah was killed.\n\nI believe that the Institute was established around the time Elijah was killed, and was still around until the death of Elijah. When Elijah would have left for Vault 111 in 2077, I believe there was no Institute.\n\nIt was also confirmed at the end of Fallout 3 that the death of Vault 111 occurred in the year 2277. This also coincides with events as I described in this wiki article. I believe that the death of Vault 111 was in either 2277 or 2287, and that the player character is still alive in that time.\n\nThis leaves two possibilities.\n\nThe player characters never left Vault 111. The Vault Dweller left before getting the manuscript in the Vault Dweller's memoirs. I believe that this leads to an answer to the question, \"Where did the player characters go?\"\n\nI have decided to use this theory for the Fallout 4 community.\n\nFor Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas (my favorite games of all time), I believe that the events leading to Elijah's death occurred much later in the game. Elijah's death happens in 2048 and 2055. Both years are very after Vault 4 was built in 2030.\n\nIf the Vault Dweller never reached Vault 4, there need to be two events for that to happen. I believe that Elijah died around 2052, when the Vault Dweller left Vault 4 for the Nuka-Cola plant (which would put Elijah's death in 2024). It is very likely that Elijah did not die in 2050 due to the Vault Dweller's Diary saying that he dies in 2048.\n\nEither way, if the vault dweller never left Vault 4, and never got Elijah's diary, you would not be able encounter the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 4. The player character would not see their super mutant successors in the wasteland. Therefore, you would assume that all super mutants in Fallout 4 are Brotherhood of Steel super mutants.\n\nI believe that it is best if you start this theory with I have decided to use this theory for the Fallout 4 community.For Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas (my favorite games of all time), I believe that the events leading to Elijah's death occurred much later in the game.

      "When they're not working towards creating great art, the artists on the team create beautiful products. One thing they're pretty good at: telling us when they've made more money than they ever believed would be possible.\n\nOne day, after working late and failing to see the sun at the end of the day, an artist named Aaron came in to the office to see his salary rise to 6 million dollars. And he wanted to thank the team the way only a true artist could.\n\n\"Hey man, you know, I'm a pretty big fan,\" Aaron told us. \"But we all know that this is our job, and that if we make mistakes—the kind that we all make every time we start a project—then we should really be held responsible.\"\n\nThe group just stared. They had no idea what to say. The rest of the team had been working together on the project for a year, yet they had been blindfolded by a new, unknown artist and his 6 million dollar salary.\n\nThey were taken aback by the amount of money Aaron was making. He had only begun his work in December of 2014, and yet Aaron was already making 6 million dollars. It was staggering. It was like a dream come true.\n\nAnd it turns out, this man was the real deal.",
      "We used to joke that it couldn't get worse. We said that while the war was going on, the country was going to break apart, we'd see riots at airports, a federal judiciary that would have to take it seriously, and a Supreme Court that would have to get a grip. But it's gotten way worse than that. We now worry that Trump will use his presidency to destroy the United States of America, which isn't just a joke anymore, it's a threat.\n\nThat's because Trump is determined to follow through on his threat to tear his predecessor down like a broken record. If he couldn't destroy the country in eight months during the Obama administration, he's trying to do it now. Just like in his first campaign, when Trump promised to make Mexico pay for a wall and launch a worldwide trade war, he promised a full-scale assault on the American system. And just as in his first campaign, he's willing to kill the messenger to get his message over and over again.\n\nTake the travel ban, for instance. Trump first tried to stop refugees, but was blocked by courts, and he went into a huff, calling the judges a \"so-called judge.\" Then he threatened to strip funding from cities that sought federal assistance in keeping out refugees and immigrants. Now his Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, is preparing to join Trump in the fight to strip funding from cities that have stood up for the rights of refugees.\n\nTrump also said he would start World War III if North Korea threatened Guam, so his administration started trying to create a no-fly zone over the territory. To be sure, if North Korea had launched a nuke over the territory, the administration would be scrambling to respond. But if it took them a few days to figure out how to respond with all of their military assets, it would be easy to imagine that they wouldn't.\n\nIt seems Trump has figured out that he can't just send missiles out into the world and expect them to reach their targets. That sort of approach leaves everyone vulnerable, including the U.S.' allies. And since he is the ultimate imprudent maverick, if he wants to use the force of his office to solve the very problems he is complaining about, he can be sure that they'll respond. That way, he'll be able to make his threats come true.\n\nThe bottom line is that we now know that the only way to make any progress against North Korea's nuclear ambitions will be through a preemptive strike. The U.S. must make sure that Kim Jong Un doesn't get to choose when or where he will attack first – that it be right where it needs to be. And if the U.S. wants to stop Kim from making a nuke, we need to be ready to unleash the nuclear capabilities that are right beside him.\n\nNorth Korea is getting far too close to being able to attack the U.S., which is part of what's driving the president's mad obsession with taking out Kim. The regime is far too close to making a nuclear missile with which to strike the U.S., and the Trump administration can't wait until it gets that far.\n\nA new report suggests that the president is already preparing a new nuclear strike strategy. \"As the situation becomes clearer and clearer, they do their job to prepare a new nuclear retaliation plan\" targeting Kim in an attempt \"to get him to re-consider.\" That means getting as close to forcing Kim to reconsider as they can before Pyongyang actually does. And to be sure, this is not like Obama's \"pivot\" to Asia, which involved increasing military ties and spending money and effort to increase the capacity of U.S. military forces in the region. North Korea is much closer to being capable of a strike on the U.S. and we should make our efforts clear.\n\nAll of this is on top of Trump's saber-rattling about invading Guam, where the president has told North Korea that it's time to sit down and have some talks, as if North Korea would give up its nuclear bomb program in exchange for talks. Trump is doing everything in his power to make the Kim regime panic, and all these moves are likely to increase North Korea's paranoia toward the U.S. If the president can provoke Pyongyang to the point that they launch a nuclear missile to hit Guam, that will make Kim feel he's finally under threat.\n\nTrump has a number of options to take on Kim Jong Un. But we're not sure Trump himself knows what to choose. Trump's first instinct is, of course, to launch a strike. But we don't think he wants to be responsible for getting Kim to re-consider at a time that it might be too late. So if that is our goal, we need to strike with as much force as possible in as short a period of time as possible. And we'll still need to find a diplomatic approach to make sure both sides can come",
      "Mitt Romney was an active participant in the Romneycare debacle during his two terms in Massachusetts. (Getty Images)\n\nIn the early years of his first term, Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was in charge of a health plan that was being implemented. Romney had been a Republican before running for governor, and was now facing a difficult reelection fight. It was 2010, and state lawmakers in the state Senate were deliberating on a bill designed to cover more of the state's uninsured through a state-federal partnership. The House, chaired by freshman Republican Eric Cantor, also was advancing a health care overhaul.\n\nBefore the meeting could begin the bill's sponsor, Sen. Martha Coakley had changed her mind and decided to drop her support, citing concerns about Medicaid. She decided not to come back for another vote on the issue so that the bill wouldn't be tabled. The Democratic leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, refused to take up the bill, and it was tabled for a while.\n\nWith the Democratic caucus split, a number of Republican senators who had been supportive of the bill came out against it. They had enough clout to stall the measure and keep it from reaching the Senate floor, and they also had the votes to force a vote. They were joined by a group that included longtime Romney adviser Ken Mehlman and Republican state Treasurer Cynthia Cox. The group included four other state senators who had opposed the bill initially: Mark Udall (D-Colo.), Mark Begich (D-Alaska) and Dan Coats (R-Ind.), as well as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine). The group's only goal was preventing a health care bill from coming to a vote.\n\nThat meant it would be up to the senators who were on one side of the bill and the members who were on the other side of the bill to work out their differences. Each Senate office would put on a conference committee and try to find a middle ground for the bill. The only problem was that none of the members who were either in favor or trying to slow it down had the votes to force a vote.\n\nSen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), who was in the middle of a Senate seat race in 2000, was part of the group that included Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) on the Democratic side and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Sen. Pete Domenici (R-Nev.) on the Republican side. The three eventually reached an agreement. They needed to get all Republican senators on board and prevent a Senate vote on any health care bill.\n\n\"What we ended up with was a kind of compromise agreement that could pass,\" Kerry told the Providence Journal after the bill passed in a 37-56 vote. The Republicans were happy about the compromise, Kerry added, but there were issues that the compromise didn't provide. For example, the Republicans wanted the new federal funds to help pay doctors to treat more people.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the compromise we came to is not the bill that came to be known as Romneycare,\" Kerry said.\n\nFor his part, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was also disappointed that Romneycare got bogged down and wasn't passed. And although now the state of Massachusetts is expanding Medicaid, which does provide medical coverage to people who are not currently eligible for private insurance, the GOP-led Legislature didn't get on board with it. And that has meant some of the uninsured -- some 600,000 people -- are still unable to get their health care through Romneycare.\n\n\"If you had any measure of Romneycare, in Massachusetts you would see it was a disaster,\" McCain said, according to the New York Times. \"The bill I helped write as an advocate of expanded health care would not have passed in Massachusetts.\"\n\n\"I was the author of the bill that created the health care system we [in Massachusetts] have today,\" McCain said at a recent conference. \"So I do not feel responsible for a health care disaster that took place in Massachusetts when Romneycare was enacted.\"",
      "It was early in the morning on March 31, when, in the middle of the day, in front of a crowd at a mosque in Berlin, a man with a bag with explosives strapped to him detonated the explosives and murdered 12 people. The man fled on a bicycle, but he was quickly caught by police.\n\nAfter an intense and thorough investigation, it was announced later that day by German Chancellor Angela Merkel on March 12 that the suspect had died of his injuries. Authorities had already named a suspect who had been arrested soon after the event, a 19-year-old Syrian-German named Anis Amri, according to German media.\n\nA few journalists noticed that a picture posted to Facebook after the suicide bombing had a man that looks like the suspected killer.\n\nThat same picture was taken by The Local and it shows a man at the same mosque as Amri the day after the suicide attack. The newspaper reported that the man in the picture lived in Dortmund with his family, but was originally from the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. He was reportedly working at a supermarket.\n\nThe man in the photo, identified only by the name Mohammed, later gave his statement to local reporters. He said he was among the first to leave the mosque when the bombing took place, and said he ran to his house.\n\nAfter that, he said he was left alone and scared while police officers came from all directions. Mohammed said he heard a lot of explosions and heard the man say, \"We have to die in Iraq.\"\n\nHowever, Mohammed also said that he did not believe the man in the photo was Amri.\n\nHe says he believes, like many others, that he may have been mistaken and had mistaken the man in the photo for someone else.\n\nWhile his statement to reporters was a shock to people on social media, the German newspaper Bild noted that Mohammed said he had made several claims of having killed several others, but that the man in the photo had nothing to do with it.\n\n\"I thought the man in the picture with the backpack was just part of a video, but in the video he seemed to do something different,\" Mohammed said of the man in the photo. \"His behaviour surprised me a lot. But I was really surprised when the police arrested him.\"\n\nIt could have been the same man\n\nWhile Mohammed's claim of mistaken identity is not a proven fact, it was interesting that in the meantime German authorities were searching for the young Syrian who had been living in Dortmund.\n\nAt 9:00 on May 1 at 12:30pm, Mohammed said he saw a young man come into his house and then he noticed the police nearby. At that time he recognized the man as that in the photo from the mosque. When asked for evidence, Mohammed showed his mobile phone, which had the number 13 in it.\n\n\"I don't think it was just a coincidence,\" Mohammed said. \"I think they [the police] knew me as well.\"\n\nIn the phone number 13 phone call, the man in the photo explained in Arabic that he had been to Syria and that one of his brothers was fighting for ISIS and was at the scene of the suicide attack with the man who was identified as Amri.\n\n\"It could have been the same man. He went the opposite way in the mosque from me,\" Mohammed said. \"In the video he looked different, even though he had the same scarf [as in the surveillance images].\"\n\nThe Syrian-German in the picture, who was born in 2003, has not been named, but Reuters reports his family now lives in northern Germany and he had not spoken with them before the April attack.\n\n\"The day before the bombing you could see him playing with a doll in the park, but before the bombing he never mentioned any of this, he never showed his face,\" the teenager said.\n\nAccording to the teenager's lawyer, he has not been able to find out what happened to his client.\n\n\"We have received no information on his fate,\" lawyer Michael Seyfried, who works for the German refugee NGO Vollmer Fund for Justice, told German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle.",

      "I have been a long time user of Google.com, since its first days. Now, I believe it is time for me to move on. It has become too much of a distraction, and it gives the Google.com experience poor overall utility when compared to Amazon's offering.\n\nWith the Amazon EC2 instance, you can host your website with no limits. With Google, even if you can't host the whole website, you can still use the search engine. No Google, and you can't sell your wares. I see two ways this could work for both users of Google and users of Amazon – and that is, the EC2 instances will allow Google to run as it has, and it would just be the web browser with the EC2 instance. Thus, Google could be a nice and safe way of searching for a new business, to keep up with the competition. For the users of Amazon, they could host the website themselves (with some limits), and then if their website gets popular enough – Amazon would see that and offer their services to them, thus removing the Google part of the equation.\n\nBoth Google and Amazon can provide a very user-friendly experience at a low cost. You just choose what features you are willing to put into the app/package you are offering in your Amazon S3. If you want to provide search capabilities, you need a search module which will take your keywords. Google has a pretty smart search module, which will parse a query for your keywords in a way which is simple to understand, and it can be pretty easy to implement in a few minutes. The Amazon search module, will take some time to learn, so you might have to go through some guides to learn it.\n\nGoogle Search Engine\n\nGoogle search engine runs on Google's own servers, and is free for you to use. I use Google on a daily basis. If you are not comfortable using a free service, I highly suggest you give the Google engine a try for your next web project or project that uses Google.\n\nIf you want to go with web-based Google search, I recommend Google Chrome. Google Chrome is a bit more lightweight than the Firefox version of Google search engine. With Chrome, you can click an address from anywhere on the page, and then start a Google search for the same location – and it works as expected. Google has an option to include multiple web-based search engines in one location, if desired.\n\nAmazon Search Engine\n\nAmazon's search engine is also available on S3. I use Amazon's search engine to search for items and products. I do not use it very often, and I do not mind if someone else uses it to search with. All you have to do is copy and paste the URL you want to search, and then hit S3 search – Google will handle the rest.\n\nPros of Google search Engine\n\nGoogle lets you use the entire web without limitations.\n\nGoogle provides many search modules, and all you have to do is click a URL to start a search\n\nGoogle can serve as its own site, and therefore you don't have to take care of it (unless we are referring to Amazon)\n\nGoogle is free to use – and this is a great option if you have the budget for it (at least, not a large budget, but still plenty of money).\n\nGoogle has many search plugins which would let you do almost anything. I had never seen Google actually run a search with these plugins before, but they work.\n\nPros of Amazon Search Engine\n\nAmazon's search engine is very easy to use.\n\nAll you have to do is make a search request to your Amazon S3 account, enter some keywords, and then hit submit. It would simply index the information and return. This would probably work just as well as Google if I have to guess.\n\nI was surprised to find that Google doesn't support images in their search engine.\n\nCons of Google search engine\n\nAmazon's search engine is more advanced and gives greater power to the user.\n\nYou have to take care of Google yourself, and the setup for it is very easy\n\nIt might be harder to run a specific search, or use a specific plugin for Google.\n\nGoogle – It just works, and it is really easy to use. I've used it for a couple of years and have really come to LOVE it.\n\nAmazon – It seems to be a bit more complicated than Google, but that does not mean there isn't a good use for it.",
      "A little over a year ago, Google Inc announced it would build a fiber network along its corporate headquarters campus in Mountain View, California — a network that would ultimately eventually provide Google Fiber to the rest of the world.\n\nToday, Google says it's making good on its word, adding a total of two high-speed internet links to the campus. The first link, which Google said will be completed by the end of the year, provides the company's existing fiber network in the building with a new, 1 gigabit-per-second access connection. This is a significant increase from the company's current speed of 15 megabits per second for the campus.\n\nThe second link, a smaller fiber connection, will be ready late next year. It's a slightly faster connection, providing Google Fiber customers in the Google Fiber-served areas with a peak download speed of 1 gigabit per second. This new network will expand Google Fiber coverage both inside and outside the Google campus, while also providing Google's employees with faster connections to their work locations.\n\nGoogle's announcement also included a list of the cities where Google Fiber will be providing access in the very near term — Austin, Texas and Provo, Utah — though Google hasn't yet announced any cities where it plans to build out Google Fiber.\n\nGoogle had been working on the fiber network since 2010 without attracting too much public attention, but the company made its move into the business earlier this year when it announced plans to offer service in Louisville, Kentucky and to launch a Google Fiber TV service at launch in Baltimore. It's not yet clear how Google is going about expanding the service outside of California.",
      "This article was published in partnership with the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that covers the U.S. criminal justice system. Sign up for the newsletter, or follow the Marshall Project on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nThe year 2018 is shaping up to be a watershed for the criminal justice system.\n\nThe year ended with a record-setting number of people locked up in jails, prisons, jails and other detention facilities—more than 220,000 people and counting. That number was the highest number of incarcerated people ever recorded in a single year.\n\nThe Justice Department's annual estimates are based in part on data from local jails, but they also include data from federal facilities, with which the government shares criminal justice information for comparison.\n\nWhile most of the people locked up at the end of 2017 are in federal facilities, the federal government's detention levels have fluctuated throughout the year. After the 2016 presidential election, federal correctional facilities began to see a spike in detainees, according to the ACLU, a nonprofit constitutional rights organization.\n\nIt is no secret that many prisoners do not pose a serious threat, or pose even a small threat to society. Many of today's prisoners were convicted of relatively minor crimes as teens, and are serving sentences for drug crimes that are largely in place years or decades ago. While they may represent a danger to society, they are not a threat to the United States.\n\nBut the increase in detainees is due, in part, to President Trump's \"tough on crime\" policies. His administration has put a premium on sentencing discretion while prioritizing mass incarceration for people with few or no criminal histories, and has proposed increasing the number of detainees each year.\n\nIn the 2016 fiscal year alone, the government spent $7.3 billion on incarceration, an increase of 15 percent since 2010, according to the National Institute of Justice. The prison population is expected to triple from about 220,000 people in 2004, to 657,931 people in 2026.\n\nThe number of people incarcerated by state, county and local authorities also has increased over the years. As state and local budgets have been cut, some jurisdictions no longer have the resources to house their own prison population. This has led to the expansion of jails with higher and higher populations of jail inmates.\n\nCameron Tinsley, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, which tracks the number of Americans behind bars, said the increase in jail population in the country over the past 30 years can trace back to a 1990 Supreme Court decision that changed the standard for sentencing a nonviolent offender.\n\nWhile some state laws have changed their sentencing laws to be less draconian, the Supreme Court's 1989 ruling means a majority of states now choose to punish offenders for many of the same offenses.\n\nIn response, states began to shift resources to incarcerate more people, often making the crime of nonviolent drug possession a \"minimum-security\" crime, with few exceptions. If a defendant is charged with a drug offense today, more likely than not, it will be a class A felony, which carries very severe punishment. In a class A felony, the sentence is six months to 10 years jail, while a class B felony carries up to 20 years and a class C felony up to life in prison.\n\nThe increase in the number of inmates is in part due to the increase in the volume of inmates, but some are also because of changes in federal sentencing guidelines and sentencing policies.\n\nIn 1986, Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which made life imprisonment the maximum penalty for some crimes. It did not expand the maximum length of prison sentences beyond what it did 30 years later, in 1984. Meanwhile, in 1996, President Bill Clinton raised the statute of limitations for federal drug crimes from two to 10 years in exchange for a commitment to using mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders.\n\nThe ACLU said the majority of inmates are nonviolent offenders, and that most are not dangerous. But, Tinsley said, the \"over-incarceration epidemic\" is because so many people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses are locked up for long periods of time—and because there are fewer federal sentencing guidelines that give prosecutors more discretion when they choose to charge someone with a criminal offense.\n\n\"There is an epidemic of over sentencing, because we have reduced the use of mandatory minimum, so the number of sentences are higher because it's not as easy to charge someone with a crime,\" Tinsley said. \"When people think they aren't going to go to prison, they just say, 'I'll go to work.'\"\n\nThe ACLU released a report this summer that details some of the ways in which racial disparities in the criminal justice system continue to be a problem. The report analyzed data from a 2013 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report, and found that blacks are 2.5 times more likely than whites to serve their entire sentences in jail.\n\nAdditionally, while the report found that the overwhelming majority of people incarcerated for nonviolent offenses are in state",
      "In addition to the upcoming Xbox One release of Mass Effect Andromeda, BioWare is getting ready to debut its Star Wars Battlefront 2 project at Gamescom, though a name for the game remains a mystery as of now.\n\nIn the past there has been a lot of speculation about where this game will be called and what it will be named, but now with the game's debut happening right before E3, nothing is certain. However, it seems that EA has decided to call it something.\n\nWith EA's decision announced recently, Twitter user @ZakZacZ tweeted that EA and DICE have officially announced that Mass Effect Andromeda will indeed be called Star Wars Battlefront 2.

EA has confirmed that The New Jedi Order is now in production at developer Motive Studios, as well as that it is currently running its internal stress tests, and that the first Star Wars Battlefront 2 beta for the Xbox One will launch in the Spring.\n\nDICE has had some rough patches with its Star Wars game over the past year, with the release of Star Wars Battlefront 2 having been delayed until Q1 2018 due to additional work. But with a number of changes since Battlefront 2's release, from some of the most prominent ones being a return to the linear single-player narrative, a larger single-player campaign with more objectives in a single game map instead of a few, a more immersive multiplayer experience and most importantly a new hero with his own unique lore, Battlefront 2 is one game that will definitely be looking to improve upon its predecessor.",

It is home to the New York Film Festival and many other famous events.\n\nYou're not going to find a big group of people here – it's so intimate, it would be a pain to get in at the bar, so everyone does their thing in their own little world.\n\nThe location\n\nThe location is on 57th and Lexington, just down the road from the NYMF festival and the world famous Broadway Theatre.\n\nMost people know where to grab a spot on Lexington.\n\nHowever, since most people use Lexington as an alternate for Broadway, we've decided to give it up.\n\nInstead, at 55th and Madison, New York, you'll find a nice spot for sitting and chatting with friends, or you can order drinks at the Broadway Theatre, but you are in no way obliged to do so.\n\nThe views\n\nWhat is not to like about these huge glass windows on the upper level of Broadway, overlooking the Central Park and the rest of the beautiful Manhattan.\n\nThe best bit is, that you won't have to pay a thing to watch it all from below!\n\nThe food\n\nWhile it might have a few old-world influences, the restaurant is still contemporary – a little high-end, perhaps – a good mix; everything from sandwiches and salads, to paninis and beer.

There are also some desserts and other indulgent items, such as the paninis, which is an Italian variation on the traditional panini where it's made on a pan with a roll on top – a great appetizer.\n\nI love their paninis, and they are always served with a little bread on the inside so it's always soft and moist and the perfect accompaniment for your meal at 55th and Lexington.\n\nThe drinks\n\nThis is probably one of the best bartending jobs for New York City, even though their cocktails are small-tipped and simple. Their drinks aren't made with complicated ingredients but have been selected to have a modern twist, and so the cocktails have the perfect touch of flavor and texture. We love their New York style martini, with a nice touch of simple fruit or herbs – something to make you think of fresh fruit. We love the fact that they don't limit themselves with the classic drink that New Yorkers love so much: vodka martini.\n\nThe food\n\nWe really love the food here. You have the choice of anything from a sandwich to a delicious pasta. We always want to try a dish we've never had before.

      "The US government spent nearly $800,000 to settle two separate lawsuits over mass surveillance of cell-site records—the records of your location and communications—at AT&T and Verizon. But the court didn't rule on the constitutionality of the program, and didn't find any evidence that the plaintiffs could prove the spying had helped thwart terrorist plots or other significant national security threats.\n\nIn the first case, the US Department of Justice paid $200,000 to settle a case brought by a New York man. The government claimed that he was a terrorism suspect when an AT&T surveillance device picked up a communication he made to a friend in Yemen that was meant for him in 2011. The government said he had used the device to carry out a terror attack.\n\nThe second was a lawsuit brought by privacy rights advocates against the phone-industry giants. In 2014 the US Department of Justice paid $1.4 million to settle with a group of residents of California and Oregon who had sued AT&T for storing the \"tower dumps\" of their mobile data in what the company called a \"terrible, awful disaster.\" In this case the records included data such as your location, duration of calls and duration of texts, as well as the phone numbers you called and the number you texted. AT&T also sent your location to other companies as it collected personal data.\n\nThe legal proceedings against the AT&T settlement were conducted in secret, and the government agreed with the plaintiffs and denied the defendants any access to records they claimed to be evidence, or any access to the court's secret ruling that the government had been violating the law.\n\nThe settlement, which was first reported by New York magazine, came in December 2013, but was settled after a federal judge said she needed more time to make sure the parties weren't violating the privacy of other customers.\n\nThe settlement will not prevent the government from continuing to store and search these records. But it does indicate that other federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, will be given more access to the records. As the New York Times reported at the time, the settlement was reached without any public hearing. Instead, it was closed out by a single FBI agent, one of several in the US government who handle legal matters for the agency. While federal officials could still obtain the same information from a court order, the court said that AT&T did not appear to be providing the same transparency and protection that the rest of the telecoms were.\n\nThe case involving Verizon is still pending.\n\nIn response to inquiries from Ars, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice told Ars that, \"Although the Department of Justice (DOJ) continues to seek a final ruling on these claims, we don't disclose how many cases we bring or settle.\" However, a spokesperson for Verizon said, \"We also don't disclose how many people might have been included in the settlement, but it's well under 500, which is consistent with the Verizon Court Orders Act—the law that governs these agreements.\"",

      "\"D-Dirty Bastard\"\n\nIt's been years since I picked up a guitar. My old guitar, a '63, has been in storage for over half a decade, excepting occasional trips to the shops when I thought the need for a replacement guitar was greater than my skill at fitting strings, adjusting pedals, and arranging the guitar's various components.\n\nI'm still pretty much in the stage of acquiring skills, and I don't think I'm going to be putting a new electric guitar on the lot anytime soon.\n\nOver the last several years, I've tried to get better at playing by taking lessons. I'm not a terribly good student, but my own mistakes are so glaring that I try really hard to learn from my mistakes.\n\nOne lesson that really stuck out for me is a lesson in guitar chords. As I've already written about a few days ago, I discovered a technique that allowed me to play many of my favorite guitar riffs much more comfortably – more comfortable than I had been able to do before.\n\nAnd the technique was developed by the guy who created the guitar chords course I've been taking since October 2011.\n\nHow to Play Guitar Chord Progression Songs\n\nThis particular chord progression I'm playing was created by John Bonham. It's based on the song \"The Battle of Evermore,\" but you can find many other songs using the same chords that are also built on guitar in the songbook \"Strum Patterns – Guitar\" by Paul Young-Cote.\n\nIf you have the book, you can go to \"chordprogression\" and type in your favorite song to see all of the chords to play over it, and then click on any of the chords to play that chord in your guitar.\n\nFor example:\n\nClick on the chord that represents the third chord in the song \"The Battle of Evermore\" to hear the chord progression to the song \"The Battle of Evermore.\" You'll hear the song in D, Em, G, D.\n\nClick on the chord that represents the F7 chord in the song \"The Battle of Evermore\" to hear the chord progression to the song \"The Battle of Evermore.\" You'll hear the song in G7, A7, D7, F7.\n\nIf you click on any of these chord progressions in the songbook, you may have to scroll to the bottom, where they will appear a little bit larger.\n\nEach of these chords gives you a single line of playing with a different finger position. All of these lines come from one chord progression, however, and the song doesn't have anything else going for it.\n\nIt would be much harder to play in those same finger positions for each of the other 13 chords in the song.\n\nThe best way to practice and memorize chord progression is to play them one after another in the book, but don't forget to keep track of which chord you started at.\n\nAs soon as you decide you've had enough, you can just memorize the songs from the same chord progression. Then, when you have enough songs, you can use the songbook again to play each of the songs, remembering the chord progression to each one.\n\nIf your brain is too tired, I've also recorded some chord progressions to use while writing lyrics and reading songs.\n\nThese are all written for your instrument, so you can play them while writing music on your guitar.\n\nClick on a chord to hear the chord progression to \"Giant Steps,\" written for the acoustic guitar.\n\nClick on a chord to hear the chord progression to \"Little Wing,\" written for the electric guitar.\n\nClick on a chord to hear the chord progression to \"Wagon Wheel,\" written for the upright bass.\n\nClick on a chord to hear the \"Blue Yodel,\" written for the piano.\n\nClick on a chord to hear the \"Ace of Spades,\" written for the viola.\n\nClick on a chord to hear the \"Back to the Drawing Board,\" written for the upright bass.\n\nThis is an excerpt from one of my new songs, \"Dirty Bastard.\" It's a song I've been playing a lot for the past three weeks while I work on other new songs.\n\nIf you've been playing \"Dirty Bastard\" for some time, you'll notice that the chord progressions in the song aren't very hard to play. They're actually quite easy, but they're easier to memorize the progression for the acoustic guitar.\n\nOn a related topic – I'm working harder on my guitar skills than ever before. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and a perfectionist works!\n\nOne day when working alone, I thought I was going to pick a bad pick because I wasn't making really good progress and the pick was rattling inside my guitar case and my head was starting to hurt.\n\nI",
      "The American public has long been aware that we face a crisis of confidence in our democracy. But Americans can't seem to agree how dire the challenge actually is—with some even arguing that the nation should be moving forward, not backwards. The public isn' t buying the Democrats' latest \"big agenda\" of new taxes and socialized medicine and wants more specifics. Polls now show that the public disapproves of the Obamacare exchanges (though only 54 percent think they've been good at reducing health-insurance costs), just as their approval of the health-care law declines. They also disapprove of the tax hikes in the Obama stimulus package and disapprove of the administration's record-breaking deficit spending, but more surprisingly, they're sour about \"new\" entitlements like Medicare—in other words, they're not happy with what Obama and the Democrats are doing to the Medicare program (and the rest of the social safety net, in general).\n\nGiven the public's appetite for concrete proposals, there's a lot at stake for the president and his team. They must take a step that's at once bolder and more complicated than he and his advisers think. This strategy of compromise is no small feat. Obama can't simply tell the American people to \"trust us.\" So, he and his team have to offer a credible plan to fix the crisis of confidence in government, and in doing so, win them over:\n\nTell the public that the crisis—not their fears of the consequences of that crisis—is why it's important for them to work with him and the rest of the administration to come up with solutions. \"Trust us,\" Obama and his team can say, \"but we're willing to work with you, we can work together, we're looking for the best outcome, but we don't need your permission; we just need you to give us the freedom to find that agreement.\" It's a long-term strategy. It's also, for now, what the American people are seeking—and should be seeking.\n\nTell the public that the crisis—not their fears of the consequences of that crisis—is why it's important for them to continue to accept responsibility for the government's choices and for their responsibility to do something to improve the situation. \"Trust us,\" Obama and his team can say, \"but we have a responsibility to act on your behalf on this,\" and \"we've come together, but we've got to do it together.\" It may look like a bunch of big talk, but it's pretty much what the American people want to hear—if they want to vote.\n\nMake the crisis of confidence in the American people the centerpiece of Obama's plan, and then focus on the substance. The American public has a lot of ideas for how to make government work better—but it's not all going to be found in the president's plans for his own part in that process. A plan will have to incorporate both the good ideas from the American people and the good ideas that will emerge from the various players in the national debate, many more voices than are heard when it comes to Washington these days.\n\nMake the crisis of confidence in the American people the centerpiece of Obama't plans for his own part in that process, and then focus on the substance. A plan will have to incorporate both the good ideas from the American people and the good ideas that will emerge from the various players in the national debate, many more voices than are heard when it comes to Washington these days. Tell the American people they're responsible not just to fix this, but to fix others (like our political systems) around it—in other words, create something better. The president can focus on two big issues that really motivate the American people: economic opportunity for everyone and social equality. Obama needs to reassure the public that, from the bottom of his heart, he means what he says about equality for all. He also needs to make clear that his policies will reduce inequality and increase social safety, because these are ideas that really appeal to most Americans. By putting these issues at the center of his plan and letting them guide him, he can put the crisis of confidence back on the agenda for them, just as it was in the 1930s and the early 1970s. \"What if the only people making decisions about your economic security didn't share your values?\" he can ask. \"You'd demand change.\" He can also remind people that, in some important ways, economic policy matters less than government policy does. \"In other words,\" he can say, \"the people who hold the future of your future in their hands have already made up their minds.\"",

      "You may not expect anything out of the ordinary, but for many, a visit to the Grand Park is like a visit to a new place. That's because the area, which borders Downtown Toronto, has become the most visited destination in Scarborough, according to a new survey by Scarborough Tourism, an arm of the tourism arm of the province's Ministry of Economic Development.\n\nThe area is expected to attract more than 50,000 more guests annually, said Tourism Scarborough president Kevin Wilson. ( Carlos Osorio / Toronto Star )\n\nResidents of Scarborough were most optimistic among those surveyed said the area would get even more visitors next year, even as the city prepares for the 2014 Pan Am Games. That's due to the continued rise of Scarborough's entertainment and tourism industries over the past several years. The survey included 8,813 people.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n\"Scarborough is going to be the hot destination at the beginning of the year,\" Wilson said, noting it is already the second most visited place in the city for 2014. But while other areas have struggled with unemployment numbers that can rise and fall quickly, the area appears to be holding steady, he said. \"We're seeing an improvement in the area's labour market as well, even though it's at a low point in terms of labour supply,\" he said. \"People are going out to work, and coming back because they like the area.\" The survey, the fourth annual Scarborough Tourism Survey, found the average annual revenue generated by Scarborough's tourism industry is about $24.8 million and that the number of nights people spend visiting is increasing in both hotels and hostels as compared with last year. And Wilson predicted the numbers to rise further in 2014. \"With more people working, it will go up even further,\" Wilson said.\n\nThe survey also found tourism in Scarborough is growing in a variety of categories. \"A lot of people travel by rail, by bus, by taxi and it's continuing to grow. And the number of hotels has gone up at such a strong rate that, on average, people are staying overnight more than the year before.\"\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nMore than 45 per cent of the respondents said they would try to travel to Scarborough in 2014. Wilson said the growth is also good news for Scarborough's economy, which he said is recovering from the recession. \"In a lot of areas the rebound has not been as good but in Scarborough we're seeing a lot of growth and a lot of investment in the sector,\" he said. \"The economy is continuing to improve but it's not as good as it can be because we don't have as many jobs.\" Scarborough is one of the cities in Toronto that hosts more than 100,000 international visitors per year, which represents a boost of $3.7 billion to the local economy, according to statistics released last October. Wilson said tourism and tourism-related jobs are responsible for the creation of 2,600 jobs and generate about $1 billion in taxes. \"We are really optimistic for 2014,\" he added.",
      "Dell has teamed up with an industry leader with their new partnership with Dell Technologies. The company announced today that, starting on March 1st, 2016, Dell will become a founding member of the OpenStack Linux Foundation (OSPF). OSPF was founded by the Cloud Foundation of which Dell (as one of the founding members) is a member, and a number of other top industry players including Microsoft and SAP.\n\nDell's commitment to OpenStack began during the OpenStack Summit in 2012 when the company announced their own OpenStack provider, OpenStack Liberty. Their announcement at the time said that \"Dell will join our OpenStack effort because we've seen that OpenStack is critical to a complete IT and business infrastructure management solution.\" Later that year they also joined with Red Hat to make use of OpenStack.\n\nNow both the Dell IT and Systems business will join OSPF as founding members. According to Dell, their \"role will be to provide leadership and expertise for the OpenStack Foundation, to support the development and standardization of OpenStack, and to collaborate with the Cloud Foundation and other Linux and cloud vendors to drive the development and delivery of new and enhanced OpenStack technologies.\"\n\nThe addition of Dell adds a great deal of momentum to the development of OpenStack and its community. This move aligns with other large company involvement at OpenStack Summit this past year, with Oracle and Google joining the project.\n\nThis partnership will help to build on a great foundation for OpenStack, which is based on a proven foundation like Linux and open-source software. For example, while other cloud operating systems such as Amazon's EC2 and Microsoft's Azure use their own proprietary cloud software, OpenStack relies on open source technologies like the Linux kernel, OpenStack Liberty, and other pieces built over time.",

      "For those of you who just got around to watching last night's Super Bowl and then want to watch more (like us), we've got some very good recommendations, but before you go crazy and add them from the first half-hour, please remember that these shows are in order.\n\nThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart\n\nEpisode 1: Super Bowl XLVIII\n\nThe Daily Show is an excellent source for news and current events and the only show on TV that is not anchored by the legendary Jon Stewart, or Stephen Colbert. In addition to covering the story of the biggest game of all–and, in this case, a few great players—Jon Stewart's main focus seems to be politics and the state of the country. He may have the big audience, but what he does is news. That's his job and it is certainly his best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt does seem that Stewart does a better job with the big events, like the Super Bowl. He had his show on as the Patriots-Broncos game was starting, then when the Broncos ran out the clock, he began with a montage showing clips of their touchdowns, and then when the Patriots scored their last touchdown he did a similar montage with footage from the Pats' playoff wins. It's really good and it does an alright job of showing what the game is.\n\nThe Daily Show Without Jon Stewart\n\nEpisode 1: The Super Bowl\n\nThis is by far the biggest-grossing show and, if the game does end up being the biggest it's a tossup, for the title of best episode we've found. This hour and a half show is probably the least politically-based episode of the three, with a mix of the big news of the day (the Super Bowl, in this case) and political satire. And it does fine with the big events. The show begins with a clip from the Super Bowl, showing Patriots linebacker Chandler Jones yelling to the crowd after his win over the Colts (which was the last game he played in before his death earlier this year). When he is congratulated for the win by coach Bill Belichick Stewart starts off the show with a clip of his final game (when he played for the Titans) then cuts to Jones in mid-flow saying, \"I don't think I will die with my last name still on the helmet,\" before the show goes into a \"Big News Story\" segment.\n\nThe show mostly does alright with the sports news–Stewart is clearly the best sportscaster not currently playing (aside from Jim Nantz and Phil Simms.) But Stewart does a good job with the political news–and the politics of the Super Bowl. \"The President has just said that the NFL will get more money from the federal government, to the tune of $30 million. If they are going to spend $30 million you know what, we might as well get some cash out of it, because they've got too much money out there,\" he starts off with. The show also does excellent with the political situation on-going in the city of New York, and the political talk about NFL teams visiting New York on Sunday. Stewart did a great job of taking the Super Bowl and applying it to the wider picture of politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of you who feel the most invested in the outcome of the election, Stewart's main topic was the \"Obama Doctrine.\" And here's how he explained it:\n\nI was recently talking to a friend of mine as we sat in Times Square looking at the massive crowds. He called it the Obama Doctrine. Now, I've been pretty much a Republican for my whole life. I was really bummed when Newt Gingrich dropped out of the race. But Obama is pretty much exactly what most of my friends warned me about. Now, I still think Newt has a chance of getting the nomination. But now he has to worry about being the Vice President. He's a pretty smart guy and I'm confident he can rise above any situation and keep the country moving forward. The Democrats are definitely going to nominate somebody else, and most of the country doesn't like that, so who could be less likely to do something crazy, and certainly less likely to embarrass himself? So it's got to be Obama. And the second he gets elected, as he did in 2008, I think the country is pretty screwed. The media is all going to be against him. The Republicans are basically running on some crazy ideas, like abolishing the Department of Education. All of his plans are crazy, but I think he has a point. America's got some very serious problems, and maybe he has the tools to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it goes into the Obama's views on the Federal Reserve (which is a fascinating subject, but this show isn't about the Fed–it's about the Super Bowl).\n\nStewart covers everything from the Super Bowl, including a clip of Peyton Manning (who's played for the Colts, but not the",
      "Rising stars of the Republican Party are stepping up to the plate to support President Trump and oppose his critics. But few of them are making it to the national podium, and the handful who have become leaders in Republican politics are doing so in ways that make Democrats fear that Republicans will become the party of obstruction.\n\nThis week's big names in Republican politics – Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, and Reps. Martha Roby of Alabama, Tom Rooney of Florida, Dave Reichert of Washington – have signed a letter with a similar spirit to one Republican National Committee (RNC) official issued in early August, saying that \"the RNC has a responsibility to make our nomination process transparent.\"\n\nWith the help of Republican mega-donors and the campaign arms of some congressional GOP leaders, the letter urges the RNC to ensure that the party's nominating process for the general election is \"as open and transparent as possible,\" to \"ensure that delegates aren't forced to be bound in any way, and to protect individual rights to state their preferences.\"\n\nThe party should make all the ballots at all state conventions on the first day as transparent as possible\n\nThe letter comes as Republicans are coming together behind the president, who is currently trailing Hillary Clinton by 3.5 million votes nationally according to CNN. They are also coming together in a number of states, including Georgia, where Cruz is mounting his only competitive bid for president of the United States.\n\nThe letter is in line with calls by Senate Republicans earlier this year, and with a call from a group of Republicans in the House last week. Those efforts failed, though, to get party members to formally endorse the idea of a rule change that would help the Republican Party better govern its caucuses.\n\nThe letter, however, was endorsed by the Republican National Committee and was made public in a statement last Monday.\n\n\"The RNC agrees with the goal set forth by the letter to ensure that the nominee for president of the United States is elected fair and open to voters in all 50 states,\" RNC Chair Reince Priebus said in a statement. \"We are eager to see any action that helps achieve that goal.\"\n\nThe RNC has worked for years to improve its process for selecting presidential candidates. \"We had a good meeting on this [Tuesday],\" RNC spokesman Sean Spicer told Yahoo News. \"We want to make sure you guys are aware that the RNC has made some improvements to the process, particularly on the presidential caucus.\"\n\nThe RNC statement included several specific steps that should improve the presidential caucus that the party has traditionally used:\n\n\n1. Every member of the National Delegate Assembly must be present. 2. Each state, territories, district, and organization of the RNC shall certify who is a delegate. 3. If there are fewer votes for a candidate than delegates, the candidate receiving fewer votes also receives fewer delegates. 4. In caucuses where the votes are cast not only by delegates but also the members of the National Delegate Assembly, each of those members should cast a vote. 5. If both presidential candidates receive the same number of votes, then only the candidate who receives the most is the winner. However, if only one candidate receives the same number of votes, that candidate is not the winner.\n\n\nWhile Spicer said the RNC wasn't taking action at this deadline, the RNC did take a step last week with the formation of a \"committeeman\" position in the party, who is now the chief election officer responsible for overseeing the party's caucuses. It is this official, as well as the RNC's plan of making all votes public, that Cotton and Perdue call for in their letter.\n\nCotton, speaking at a breakfast in Arkansas on Tuesday and in a separate interview shortly afterward, said that the party does not need a rule change to make the caucuses more transparent.\n\n\"If they're going to do what they should do, they'll let a majority vote in the Republican Party,\" Cotton said of the RNC. \"If that isn't going to happen, then it's very important for us to not just talk the talk and do the right thing. But to actually follow through on it and do what we said we would do to be transparent and open and representative of the people in every single state of this country.\"\n\nCotton, who was elected to the Senate in August, said he's been in contact with fellow Senate Republicans on the issue and that he expects his colleagues \"will give our view and our support as they have been in this area.\"\n\nThe Arkansas senator expressed optimism about the impact of the RNC's plan to let caucus delegates cast their votes by electronic machines or not voting at all but said that Republicans in Arkansas might be less thrilled about change because the party's delegate structure isn't yet as open to new and independent GOP voters in that state as it is in the other, more open-party states.\n\nCotton declined to offer",
      "For a full list of updates, check out our previous post on the event.\n\nIf you've been to a convention or game store in the past year that was organized by a board-gaming group, chances are you've played a game that was set as a \"challenge\" for attendees. It may have been a game that asked a group of players to identify an item or solve an environmental puzzle as part of a single player's (or their group's) goal, or a game that pitted groups of up to five players in a series of different challenges (based on the theme of a particular game), or a game where a group of people battled it out to collect a specific item or score points for the group.\n\nWhat's the point? Why was this particular game used in this way? If not because the theme appealed to the group, then what was it about it that would motivate someone from the group to take it upon themselves to complete it?\n\nThat last question is crucial, and one that is rarely talked about. It's a tough one to answer, and it's especially hard if you've had no experience with a game or other creative medium that is similar in nature to board gaming; it's more about the cultural connotations of a particular theme that might get in the way of getting a group of friends together to play. While we're not interested in going down that road, we've found that for all participants, the more people play a particular item or activity in a convention, the more the participants become attached to it.\n\nWe call this phenomenon attachment to theme, and it's a powerful force to overcome. What we're interested in here is the effect of a particular theme on those that play it. Can theme actually influence and benefit an activity? Well, it can, but we're not sure that it's possible to be positive about it without taking that a step backwards and understanding that the \"theme\" is often a product of the players themselves.\n\nAttachment To Theme in Action: Munchkin\n\nMunchkin, which has been around since the early 90's, was originally designed to be a game with a group of players. In Munchkin, the goal was not to compete in terms of score but instead, to identify and collect items. It didn't matter if the item you were trying to find was hidden in a particular box or you'd had to hunt for it for a while. The idea was to identify it and collect it.\n\nAs such, this game was built from the ground up around the theme of hunting. A great way to illustrate that the theme is built around hunting is to look at the basic game rulebook from Munchkin:\n\nNow imagine what those rules look like if you had a group of people who were just about all looking for the same thing:\n\nThe rules will look very different in the two scenarios, and that's because of how the theme works. The Munchkin design is built for people whose goal is to collect items, and hunting is something that has a huge social context in the Munchkin experience.\n\nTo begin with, Munchkin focuses on the social context. In order to do that, it's built around the basic concept that a group of people at a table is an interaction. It's not a game in and of itself. It's a way to get players together, and then there's the need for them to feel connected to each other and to the game. That's one of the big themes.\n\nA great deal of that can be traced back to the Munchkin core belief in hunting. That's part of the core philosophy that the game is built around. If you've played any games in the Munchkin universe, you've all had the same basic experience -- you're playing a game and then you're going to hang around for a while, either to hunt stuff or take on challenges to help get you up to speed, or get out of your own head and go hunt stuff, or maybe it's just to shoot stuff in a game. Those are great experiences. The theme also takes you there.\n\nThis is one of the most important things that the design team at Hasbro has worked on. They've come right out and said this in their rulebook, in a very prominent place:\n\nYou can't play Munchkin until your first game. It's a one-time experience. The game is designed with one-time play in mind. You're there to get together with your friends for one game, then you're gone. You won't play Munchkin again before the game's over. You don't leave the game, and you don't enter into Munchkin again.\n\nThis is incredibly important. A game cannot succeed unless the group has had an enjoyable experience, and if they don't, the group will leave and probably not come back.\n\nThe other part of that that you might not have seen, if",
      "The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995\n\nThe Shivering Isles is part of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, a third-person, open-world roleplaying game. It was released in October of 2003.\n\nIn the Shivering Isles, you are not a warrior or a mage, but rather a pirate. Instead of the classic class system of Skyrim, you start with a character template, and are given skills that help to form the character you make. You also begin on the Isle of Artaeum, and are granted a map to Cyrodiil from the Emperor, and one quest from Vlindrel Hall. You enter the Shivering Isles and begin to explore the island, while taking quests from various NPCs. If you accept all quests offered to you as a pirate, the completion of the game will make you a legitimate member of the island's merchant crew.\n\nThe game uses a simple open-world design. You must travel in a ship, with a small group of followers and a variety of ships. Your ship may be destroyed in battle or the weather, but no other ship will be allowed to stop or dock on another player's island. If you wish to make your own island, be sure to follow the requirements at the bottom of this page.\n\nWhile you cannot have any followers with you, they will follow you around and help you wherever you can go. Each island has an NPC called \"Master of the Seas\", who will assist you with various tasks, as well as an NPC named \"The Captain\". When you accept a new quest from either or both of them, the Captain will inform you and give you the appropriate directions to make that island.\n\nYou use the arrow keys to move, use the spacebar to stop, and use the mouse to look. When moving, hold down left click to turn and then quickly release to continue forward. You can also press the 'q' key to toggle in and out of first person view, and press the 'd' key to get out of it. Holding right click or left click will zoom in with a mini-map, and holding down the left click button will zoom out once with a fully-explorable map. While using these keys, keep an eye out for other boats. When you are on a vessel with no other ships nearby, it will be highlighted in green. You can also press the 'P' key to get information about the position of other players on the map.\n\nThe following table summarizes what each key does:\n\nKey Action Shift A Quick travel to a desired location Ctrl / Z Cancel current item or action, return to character menu X Use a map screen (useful for navigating) Shift + P Get quest information from Master of the Seas\n\nWhen you start a new game, you will be automatically assigned a starting place on the Isle of Artaeum. You will later be given a quest to travel to Cyrodiil with the help of an Imperial Ship, which will bring you to a port.\n\nYou have a large compass at the top of the screen on which is written the ship you are currently on (note that each ship has different names and is unique to the island you are in). This compass is used for traveling in the Shivering Isles. On your right side is a map showing the location of islands and major cities, and in the top left corner is the compass, and a number that represents how far to the player currently is from the island's center.\n\nIn the above table, the number for the player's current location in the Shivering Isles is listed in parentheses beside the location's name. To determine what is currently on the compass and what is in the nearest island, the player must consult the map on the computer screen.\n\nIf you go back to the map and zoom in, you will notice that your movement is slowed down. This is due to distance to the center of the map being displayed in a smaller window than you are used to. This has been done to keep the player moving smoothly. If you go out of range of the map screen (as long as you stayed in range of the compass if zoomed in) you will have to move the mouse around until you come back onto the correct area of the map. You can also zoom out of a map screen, then zoom back in and have the map screen appear on top of the map.\n\nOne of the major features of the game is the unique quest system. For a full description of what can be done, and a list of what you may already have done, see Quest List (by quest title). In addition to these quests, there are many more optional quests you can undertake. If you want to see what some of these quests are, check out the Shivering Isles Main Quest List by Quest Title.\n\nThe quest system is unique in that it does not have a turn-based system as some open-world RPG's. Instead, you have",
      "TAMPA — This is what makes Donald Trump a formidable opponent, the kind of candidate who the party Establishment fears. If he can pull off a win next week, it will be one of the biggest showdowns in state party history.\n\nAnd it is all happening at the same time the Republican National Committee has launched an all-out assault on Trump, urging a new round of primary challenges as the GOP's presidential contest winds down.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"It's a lot to take, and it's a lot to swallow — but we've got our arms around it — and everybody's in line,\" one Ohio Republican operative said of facing Trump next week.\n\nThe anti-Trump effort is so far gaining little traction, and it's unclear just how much the RNC campaign can help in the short term as the battle with Trump drags on. The party is also counting on Trump to carry his usual base in the state's April 18 primaries — a large chunk of the GOP electorate that's traditionally stayed loyal to the party in off-year elections.\n\nGOP operatives said that in the near term, if Trump wins Ohio and can stay on track to pick up at least two other states that have voting that week — Illinois and Maryland — Republicans can keep him away from a clean sweep and save some of the party's highest hopes for Ohio next month.\n\nBut the party's campaign to blunt Trump's momentum — from the RNC to state parties to its candidates down ballot and its top leaders — is likely to continue for months. That's especially true if Trump doesn't win this week by a wide margin — he'd need only 30 or so delegates to win the nomination outright.\n\nIf Trump doesn't win the nomination outright next week, there are at least two ways he can win it in a contested convention. He could secure the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright: He'd have to win all or nearly all the remaining states (and the District of Columbia) by June 7 or June 14. Or he could collect the requisite number of delegates, but they would then be free to vote for whomever they want when the convention convenes the following week. That's called a \"brokered convention.\"\n\nBoth scenarios would be a major upset, and the Republican Establishment has been working to slow them. Trump's top rivals (particularly Ted Cruz) have already attacked him as a \"con artist\" and vowed to deny him the nomination if he's the nominee, although few actual delegates are currently involved.\n\nIf that happens, Republicans will need a new alternative candidate: The party has had enough of Trump, and Republicans want new leadership who is willing to lead — not just try to stop him and his attacks on GOP elites. While Trump's team has been working hard to woo reluctant members of the Republican establishment, they've been outflanked by a force much more willing to speak out: the Trump wing of the party and its grass-roots base.\n\n\"Any establishment candidate will get obliterated if the base decides it doesn't want one,\" said Scott Reed, a top operative in the Republican National Committee.\n\nA slew of candidates on the right is challenging Trump in the upcoming nominating contests. The biggest names are Trump's Ohio GOP rivals, but also former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.\n\n\"If he doesn't hit 30, who knows?\" said Mark Weaver, a former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. \"It might be 30, but it might be 15 or 18. It's going to be a very competitive field — this is what makes it hard for anyone else to carry the day. It's going to be a really tough race.\"\n\nOhio's voting next week is going to be a key battle in the party's long-shot effort to deny Trump the nomination before the GOP convention. Trump had hoped to make this one a one-on-one race before the convention, but Ohio Republicans have refused to give him a clear path to victory — a situation that hasn't changed since the state GOP announced its ballot line ahead of time. There are just two days left before the voting.\n\nSo if Trump doesn't hit enough of the state's delegates before the convention, his campaign will likely move on to the next primary contest.\n\nIf his opponents split the primary vote (as some are arguing) Ohio is likely to go for someone else:\n\n• Cruz vs. Trump – Texas Sen. Ted Cruz won the primary in Ohio's March 15 primary by less than 1 percentage point, but the Texas firebrand has a history of winning the Buckeye State. Trump needs more delegates than Cruz to avoid a clean sweep in the March 15 winner-take-all contests.\n\n• Huckabee vs. Trump – Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee will try his best to beat Trump in the winner-take-all states of Ohio and Florida's winner-take-all primary. If Trump wins both, he doesn't need all the state",
      "\"Our experience with these groups is they don't have the best track record with children, especially young children.\"\n\nThis story was produced as part of the project \"The Children of Guantanamo.\" This story is part of a year-long examination of the detention center's impact on U.S. veterans.\n\nBobby Ray Moore is seated in a bright classroom at the Naval Academy Preparatory School, studying how to use his camera. He's on break from class to film the school's annual graduation ceremony on Friday. That's a pretty good excuse to go out in public, says Moore, a Navy veteran who spent 15 months in a Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. But after working as a public relations professional in Washington, Moore is struggling with the idea of being filmed by his 11-year-old cousin.\n\n\"I'm not going to get shot in the back at something I'm doing,\" he says. \"But I think I don't want to be on a public street, I don't think I want to be in a bar or anything where I could be in danger.\"\n\nThese are among the many concerns of U.S. veteran men of color who served in Guantanamo Bay or have since returned to the U.S., many of whom have had negative experiences interacting with the public. The men say that they are especially concerned about what happened to them once they were released from Guantanamo, whether because of retaliation for their activism or because they struggled after being detained for years.\n\nThese concerns are raising questions about whether the U.S. should continue to hold its prisoners indefinitely or should consider ending the practice of sending detainees to the U.S. It's been nearly 11 years since the prison was closed and less than a year since President Obama signed into law the detainee policy overhaul called the National Defense Authorization Act, which ended indefinite detention without charge or trial for U.S. citizens, including many former detainees.\n\nThe question of whether to close Guantanamo remains divisive among many in the U.S. government and security communities, raising the specter of another war for the Republican Party in the wake of the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, last year. Many Republicans have criticized Obama for signing an executive order on the prison and his administration for not doing more to close the prison, arguing that he could have done more.\n\nThat executive order was enacted by President George W. Bush in December 2006 and required that detainees released from Guantanamo between January 23, 2006, and the end of December 2011 be brought to the U.S. and tried in federal courts, with the possibility of a death sentence if convicted there. After five and a half years of war in Iraq and a year at Guantanamo, and three of the detainees still in military custody had already been tried and convicted, that order was renewed in October 2009, and a moratorium on other detainee releases was lifted. President Obama signed it into law in January 2009.\n\nBut over the last year, the Obama administration has asked Congress a series of questions aimed at tightening those restrictions on detainee releases that could end up closing the prison and ultimately bringing some of the more than 600 detainees who remain out of Guantanamo to the U.S.\n\nIn interviews, these men and others who have spent time at Guantánamo say they often worry about how they'll explain their experiences at the prison to their families back home. The Obama administration has taken steps to give former prisoners the chance to tell their story publicly or privately through media interviews, as well as through the use of the Freedom of Information Act, as long as the information does not identify them by name.\n\nOthers, though, are still waiting for this information. That includes Navy veteran and former Guantanamo detainee Christopher Hicks. Hicks, who has been interviewed extensively by military investigators, was among the first to become eligible for the executive order permitting him to discuss his experiences there. Hicks was released from Guantanamo a few months after it was closed.\n\nHicks also has another concern. He says he was threatened with physical violence when he was detained for more than a decade. His ordeal began in December 2002. On that day, he went to the market with his father, who ran a grocery store, for a turkey. Hicks had just been freed from the military prison at Guantánamo Bay and was on his way to the grocery store by bus. The bus broke down as he was trying to drive, and Hicks says a man tried to steal his purse from the bus. Hicks chased him down the street and ran into the store he works at, the U.S. Post Office. The same man tried to steal a sandwich from the store's deli, and Hicks was again forced to chase him out of the store.\n\nHicks' father, George, was working in the deli and was not able to intervene, Hicks recalls. He says he found himself standing outside the deli, with the man standing in front of his store, pointing a gun at him. \"I was being",

      "The Obama administration just released an official proposal for the creation of a military sanctuary in Puerto Rico that would give the islands' military a safe haven from the potentially violent waves of migrants coming from the U.S. mainland. Obama also promised the \"best of the best\" in federal manpower to assist in the relief effort.\n\nBut the proposal also offers one of the most draconian solutions ever put forth in federal policy—a \"no-pass, no-go\" policy that would make it illegal for citizens to travel between the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico for longer than 48 hours without prior authorization, even if they had a valid visa.\n\nThe proposal—which was published online Friday by the Department of Homeland Security—is designed to allow Puerto Rico's Army National Guard to protect some of the island's infrastructure, the government says, including power stations, hospitals and the military hospital on the island that treats wounded and sick soldiers.\n\nThe Obama administration's request for funds amounts to about $25 million, the government says, but it is currently up to the Puerto Rico legislature to decide how to spend it if approved. If the Puerto Rico Legislature approves the request, the plan comes with a list of other measures that the government proposes to enact to \"reminiscerate the island's vulnerability to climate change\" and to \"protect and restore Puerto Rican life and heritage to the fullest extent possible.\"\n\nThe proposed plan would require that anyone from the U.S. mainland traveling to or from mainland Puerto Rico for longer than 48 hours before being cleared by U.S. authorities must obtain authorization, and it would also apply to residents of \"foreign countries and territories\" who travel to Puerto Rico for purposes \"other than tourism.\" Even U.S. military personnel traveling with valid military credentials would be required to have a permit to enter Puerto Rico.\n\nThis is a draconian proposal. The White House has been working on the proposal for \"more than three years,\" officials say. According to official figures, more than 5,000 Americans, nearly half of them military personnel, have traveled to Puerto Rico—which has a population of 3.5 million—between October 2011 and the end of October 2013. More than 2,500 military personnel have also been treated in hospitals on the island.\n\nBut there is little reason to believe that these statistics are representative. The Puerto Rican media has reported that some U.S. military personnel have been staying in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where many of the same conditions exist for U. of R. citizens traveling to Puerto Rico.\n\nFurthermore, as a recently released investigation by The Daily Beast revealed, many U.S. military bases were built in Puerto Rico and are still used by the government. Moreover, in the first two months of the Obama administration, U.S. Coast Guard ships rescued almost 4,000 people from drowning in the South Atlantic. These people had been swept to the beaches, which were then flooded by rising sea levels.\n\nThe federal officials' proposal would also grant Puerto Rico control over a portion of the federal prison system, which would mean that the island's prisons, which are largely run by the Department of Justice, would have to transfer inmates to other federal prisons on the island in order to receive U.S. prisons' security costs. These cost-sharing measures would be imposed not only on jails, but also on prisons in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nIn addition, in a particularly chilling measure, the proposal makes it illegal to travel between U.S. states without prior \"authorization,\" without disclosing the reason for the trip and without carrying an \"exit permit.\" If you have been to Puerto Rico without a visa, and you decide to go back to your home state because you fear the situation there will get worse, you will be arrested and held in jail until you are permitted to enter again.\n\nIn a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said:\n\nToday's proposals take a big step forward to rebuild Puerto Rico. Over the next few weeks, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will work with our partners in Puerto Rico, in Congress and abroad, to craft a legislative proposal that will secure the resources necessary to rebuild and restore Puerto Rico—and to rebuild our nation's confidence in our immigration system. These proposals make clear that, at a time of serious challenges in U.S. immigration, we will continue to take a comprehensive approach to protecting our borders and security, while at the same time working to improve our immigration status for Americans.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R), the ranking member of Sen. Marco Rubio's (R), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that is studying the proposal, said \"the proposal comes with the greatest number of serious concerns and significant limitations\" for U.S. citizens traveling to Puerto Rico. In a statement released Saturday, Rubio said:\n\nI strongly believe that the current U.S. administration will abandon its efforts to take away Puerto Rico's",

      "\"What does the Bible teach about eating animals?\" I heard that question for years by myself and it always perplexed me. My understanding of the Bible was only as good as the version of its story I learned as a kid. It was only through the Internet that I could start learning more. Since that time I became an advocate for meat-eating in general. I was not alone in that and a good number of Christians in America became vegan as a direct result of learning about the Bible. For those who are a bit more knowledgeable of Biblical principles, it is clear that Scripture provides ample insight as to the proper way to use animals and their products. This is the heart of what the Bible teaches about animal use:\n\n1- God created the animals on the fourth day, not as in modern times with modern technology.\n\n2- God's purpose was to be merciful before creating them for food, as a reminder to His people of His love for them.\n\n3- God did not create the animals with the intent of using them for food.\n\n4- Animals were intended to be our food, and we should treat them as such.\n\n5- The purpose of eating animal flesh and eating its meat products is to honor God by eating a living sacrifice made in His name.\n\nGod created Adam and Eve as a reminder for His people to be holy creatures and to not desecrate God's name. If God is our holy idol, then to desecrate Him we must desecrate His image.\n\n6- The Bible tells us that God gave man dominion over the plants, which is the reason we created all the animals.\n\n7- Even in our modern times, plants are the most intelligent of all living creatures. We can make them do all of the things we want with them.\n\n8- Animal flesh and animal products have become our most valuable commodity and are used as our first line of defense against disease and predators.\n\n9- God will eventually allow us to eat animals, at least for a small period of time. Then, it will be time to make more sacrifices from our most loved ones. Then, it will be time to start eating animals in their natural habitats.\n\n10- It was not God's intent to allow us to make animals into our slave labor of labor.\n\n11- Even though God created our bodies as male and female, we can still make a covenant with God and change our sex. Our bodies are our best gift to God, and if we choose to use them to be a gift to others God will bless us with more than we could ever have imagined.",
      "\nA couple of days ago, my parents were visiting from Canada. On the way to dinner we passed a large wall of ice in front of the subway station. It looked like there had been a massive storm, and the roadways were filled with ice. The cold and the wind looked like it would drive people to suicide.\n\nIt was like the scene in The Shining where the kids watch the dead kids hanging from the ceiling. A horrible and tragic scene.\n\nThe truth is, the ice was frozen over this weekend and was not caused by a storm. The cause? Another meteorite, this one the size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia this month.\n\nI can only imagine what kind of devastation its going to cause in Siberia. How many cars are going to be destroyed? How many buildings are going to be damaged?\n\nAnd in what sense was I alone on the subway system? I was not. There were several dozen other people on the train when the ice began to form. It was a very loud and very ugly scene. I hope people who have been injured or killed by meteor strikes realize how beautiful and serene the world is until you witness such devastation.\n\nWe got off on the 6th floor and I was the only one who went down to the ground floor. Several people were going down the stairs.\n\nIt wasn't just that the subway was freezing over. The entire station was frozen over. You could see the ice on the walls. You know, the stuff on the walls in our high school science labs? It was the stuff all over the ceiling. The ice was as thick as brick on the walls and the tracks, and the ceiling tiles were already cracked, like they'd been dipped in ice and allowed to dry. It was pretty scary. We had no idea what might have happened at the top of the subway.\n\nThe entire thing was terrifying. You feel helpless to tell your parents to come back to Canada. What the hell can you do, right? You're here. Do something. Call your friends, but you're also scared that your parents might freak out.\n\nIt was only the second time I'd ever been on the underground. I'd seen plenty of them in school. It was always crowded, just like the subway was on my way to the first day of high school.\n\nAnd there were a lot of people in this tunnel when I got out. I can't really tell, because there really wasn't any time to make out the crowd or see their faces through the ice. I could hear the trains speeding past me. I couldn't hear anything from the bottom part of the tunnel but I knew something had fallen down.\n\nI went to the bottom of the train and looked down. The rest of the people seemed to look up along with me. I had never seen so many people together before on the subway. That is when I realized that I was not alone.\n\nA lot of kids my age were looking up at the sky. We were all looking up toward the sky to see what had happened. As I watched the sky, I saw that the clouds were very large, and then much larger. Suddenly there was a big piece of ice in the air. It was not going to move, but it was there, a small chunk of ice, just sitting there. I could even see one of the trains pass over it as it continued to break up and fall to the ground, the cloud of ice covering the train.\n\nI realized that I was not alone anymore. This little piece of ice was a small part of the whole. The whole thing was big. It was more impressive and magnificent than any movie scene I'd ever seen.\n\nThe cloud of ice turned back into a piece of ice before it reached us, which was quite strange. We could all see it breaking through.\n\nAs it went through the air, the clouds cleared as it headed straight for us. It stopped to give me a look. A look that said, \"Do whatever you want with that frozen mass. I'll be happy to watch.\"\n\nI started walking away. You can't go so fast on a subway. The ice was moving, but it was not moving very fast, and we just couldn't seem to keep up.\n\nI was out of breath, and I was so surprised to see that the whole of the sky cleared away before it got me. It's almost like they were watching us. It looked like it was saying, \"You're not going to get away.\"\n\nWhen it turned back into a piece of ice, I was a bit freaked out. There were no more cars that I could see, and the sky was now clear again. I was back on the ground floor of my apartment where I was standing two seconds before.\n\nI have never seen so many kids on a subway. A whole bunch of people were standing around, not too far from the train",

      "The New York Times\n\nI had a good run.\n\nFrom the time I ran for mayor of New York City six years ago — when I ran as a populist and a radical, calling for a city where every woman held a top-level job, a city where every child could go to decent public schools, a city where children and families were treated as more than a budget balance, and a city that built great schools, community centers, public housing, affordable housing, and job training for New Yorkers of all backgrounds — we had the most vibrant young and vibrant Latino population, the deepest and best-organized working class, and a vibrant Muslim community. And we made enormous progress.\n\nBut the job is not done. Our city is much too racially divided. Our budget is too huge. Our transportation system is too broken. Our schools are not keeping up. The gap between rich and poor is too wide. As a city, we remain under-served by police, by fire and by education.\n\nSo I take stock. In addition to taking more personal responsibility for the things we can do, I plan to get even more ambitious: I will put forward a plan for the citywide creation of a task force — like a commission or a government-wide task force — to take a hard look at the problems and take concrete action. I will also have a task force on homelessness.\n\nSo, after a decade of running for mayor of the most diverse and most prosperous big city in the country, I don't have high hopes for success.\n\nBut I've learned that change can happen. And it's better today than it was when I came here in 2005. So I'm ready to go to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times\n\nLet's look back, shall we?\n\nI can't remember a time of better times. The economy was booming: We had over 300,000 new jobs, the unemployment rate had dropped to 2.7 percent, and home values were booming. New homes were being built; the number of renter households was rising.\n\nI remember standing on Fifth Avenue with the people of Brooklyn and Queens watching the skyrocketing rent rates they were seeing. I know from talking to people in housing projects, low-income apartment complexes, and churches that rent is a struggle for people in this city.\n\nI remember when I was still in my 20s working three jobs and struggling with housing issues, and when I was running — a city where housing conditions were terrible and there were no new homes being built and where a new city council member from Brooklyn would have to walk from his house to the public safety building on Fifth Avenue in order to get to work.\n\nI remember running, campaigning for my first full term, in an election where turnout was at only 38 percent. And what really got me was listening to people I'd met in my first campaign, many from the neighborhood with the most problems.\n\nI remember when I talked to people, I was standing in the lobby of a hotel on Lexington Avenue, and I asked a group of young people to help me move one of their desks. They said, \"We can't do that!\" I said, but your life depends on it. And they couldn't believe it. They just couldn't believe it.\n\nI remember when I ran for mayor, with only a few days to go, and I was having breakfast at two different spots — one was at La Boulange — when the young woman who helped to make my food came up with a brilliant idea: We should have one place where we could all grab a bite to eat at 8 o'clock in the morning.\n\nI remember when I was running for the mayor's office, and someone called to say that I had won the Hispanic endorsement. It was a remarkable achievement for a candidate with so little political experience.\n\nI remember when I was running for the executive office of New York City, and I walked into the office of one of my supporters — a very bright and dedicated young man who had already worked on my presidential campaign in Miami — and asked him, \"Can I come over for a few minutes and talk to your kids in the living room?\"\n\nI remember how in my first inaugural in Brooklyn, a young man from a low-income community came and told me, \"The first thing I want to do is to hug my mother and father.\" I told him, \"Well, I think I've seen what a hug feels like, but I think I can handle it.\n\n\"I love you son,\" he said. \"Go hug your mom.\"\n\nThe New York Times",
      "Hate Crime: The Latest and Greatest Trend in America Right Now\n\nThe media and the political establishment are on the warpath against Donald J. Trump for his criticism of illegal immigration and his opposition to the establishment's open-borders policies.\n\nThe hate crime panic is an attempt to silence and control the president-elect, one that will be futile for the simple reason that most Americans — conservatives, libertarians, and even most liberals — are too familiar with race-related crime in the United States to accept an influx of \"outsiders\" whose very presence doesn't threaten their safety or their culture.\n\nThe media is also desperate to keep America from focusing its national attention on the real problem: the corrupt economic system that is destroying the United States before our very eyes, which leads to the rise of ISIS, an Islamic caliphate that is terrorizing the West and even attempting to conquer the U.S. mainland.\n\nIf the Left can create an enemy to justify the loss of the presidency, then we can forget about changing the system.\n\nBut, the most ironic part of the anti-Trump frenzy is that some of the biggest haters of Trump are the same people who routinely defend and celebrate racially-motivated crime and violence.\n\nFor example, a recent article by the Boston Globe highlighted the rise of \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Stop and Frisk\" policies in New York City. It did, however, provide a quote from a Boston police officer speaking to Breitbart News in response to the article.\n\nA black officer of the Boston Police Department commented on the Boston Globe about \"Black Lives Matter\" and how the group is trying to paint African-American men as criminal.\n\n\"Let me quote that again for you, this isn't a 'Stop and Frisk,' this is 'Black Lives Matter,'\" said Lieutenant Michael McCarthy of the Boston Police department. \"You know, stop and frisk was instituted so the police department would have a better chance of finding weapons on individuals when there were weapons on persons.\"\n\nThese statements are consistent with a recent poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) and found that 60 percent of Americans believe it is \"acceptable\" to assault police officers on camera, to film them in the act of assaulting unarmed civilians, or to taunt them with violent threats.\n\nThis doesn't end with cops of all races: According to PRRI: \"Majorities of both conservatives (62%), Republicans (67%), and Republicans (65%) agree that it is acceptable for a citizen to film or photograph police officers engaging in a public official's duties.\" In addition, 53 percent of Republicans think it is \"acceptable for police officers to be beaten up during a citizen's police arrest if the citizen believes the officer has committed a crime\" and 52 percent of Republicans say violence against police is acceptable in some or most cases.\n\n\"Black Lives Matter\" and their allies also find such sentiment acceptable. For example, a recent article in the Baltimore Sun revealed that Baltimore activists are calling for the destruction of \"Whitey\" statues:\n\nMore than a third of blacks in Baltimore favor destroying statues of Robert E. Lee and Confederate Gen. Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, according to a survey released Monday by the African-American Policy Forum. \"White Americans should take them down,\" said the Forum's executive director, Derrick Johnson. \"The American Civil War was fought over these monuments. You cannot erase history. The Civil War was fought over slavery, and this is how you honor your enemy.\"\n\nWhile white supremacists love to use a symbol of racism to rally around — even if it is a symbol of an oppression inflicted by a large segment of a minority population against the majority — a symbol representing a historically oppressive group is not a symbol of racism.\n\nThese statements are consistent with several surveys that document that racism is on the decline, especially among young people:\n\nJust this week, The Atlantic highlighted another poll from the Public Religion Research Institute, which found that young Americans are much more likely to support policies to protect minority rights. When asked if they \"strongly favor\" or \"somewhat favor\" having laws that would establish \"racial preferences for public schools,\" a majority were in favor of such protections. Young Americans also opposed the notion of having \"racial preferences for hiring and firing.\"\n\nDespite the general decline in racism, however, the media and Left are determined to paint Trump as racist and even \"fascist\" for criticizing our illegal-immigrant immigration policies.\n\nAfter all, why would an American president — especially a presidential candidate — openly criticize a policy that puts the safety of Americans and their security at risk?\n\nIndeed, why wouldn't the entire GOP establishment, including the mainstream media, demonize Trump for daring to question our open-borders policies?",
      "You're driving and your smartphone shows an error message saying that the battery is low. Why do these notifications happen and what's wrong? Here are the most common ones. (Daron Taylor,Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\nLast spring, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into one of the leading smartphone apps, \"Find My iPhone.\"\n\nThe problem was that no one was monitoring that app when it showed the message. Because only one carrier actually monitored the app, when it showed that a user's battery was about to run out, few people noticed. As a result, it was easy for phone hackers to gain access to phones and access data, such as text messages and photographs, using the Find My iPhone app. Now the FTC is looking into whether the app should have been more visible to users.\n\n\"The findings of the investigation have shown that consumers had no way of knowing they were being scammed,\" Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, a division of the agency, said in a statement.\n\n[FBI asks Apple to help it crack iPhone passcode protection]\n\nThe FTC complaint against Apple, which the agency filed in April, alleges that the company violated three separate agreements with consumers. The first one was an agreement with Microsoft in February 2013, when the company announced that it had signed a new agreement allowing it to offer the popular Find My iPhone app on the Microsoft Surface. But by that time, Apple still didn't have that app.\n\nThe second is an agreement the companies made in July 2009, and Apple still hasn't fully complied with, according to the FTC's complaint. The third is a confidentiality agreement.\n\n[Apple faces new charges as U.S. probe widens to include Android]\n\nApple does require the use of the Find My iPhone application, which it sells as a separate app, and it charges $14.99 for the app.\n\n\"Apple's use of Find My iPhone was designed to make it easier for consumers to locate their phones,\" said Jay Edelson, an attorney with Mayer Brown who specializes in technology and privacy law. \"By selling it for pennies on the dollar, Apple could make as much money as they wanted and not worry about any repercussions.\"\n\nIn response to the FTC's complaint, Apple issued a statement saying:\n\nApple is the only company that is required to provide notification to its users of this service. When a user receives that notification, that notification is only visible to the user. As consumers use Find My iPhone, they are encouraged to immediately open that notification, which provides the user with the ability to manage his or her contacts, contacts groups, photos, calendar and other important information. We also ask that consumers not to reactivate the feature after being notified about it. The Find My iPhone notification notification is only a notification and does not require any action on the part of the user.\n\nThe FTC complaint, filed against Apple along with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Trade Commission and several states and territories, seeks redress — penalties and attorneys' fees. It also seeks an order declaring Apple in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Federal Wiretap Act or the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. If Apple is found to have violated any of those laws, the FTC could seek the same penalties or additional relief as part of a separate suit in federal court.\n\nApple and the FTC declined to provide an interview for this story.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Apple has not done enough to make sure the app is only installed on devices owned by a consumer, not one that has been purchased with a stolen credit card.\n\n\"There's plenty of reason to suspect that Find My iPhone might be a scam,\" Edelson said. \"But people weren't asking for that.\"\n\nFraudulent applications \"can make people so nervous of using any device that they never do,\" he said. \"So consumers are not being told about it.\"\n\nFor example, some people thought that the iPhone was hacked into when a message popped up on their screen saying, \"The iPhone has been compromised and has been accessed.\"\n\n\"I didn't even know there was a Find My Android app,\" said Brian W. Ho, a lawyer in Boston who is representing a customer in a class-action lawsuit that alleges that the iPhone is hacked in every major city every day.\n\nHe also didn't know that the Find My iPhone app was supposed to be used only on one specific Apple device at a specific time. And he thought that, if someone used their iPhone to make a purchase, the retailer would notify the buyer that their phone no longer has access to any of their information.\n\n[What it's like to have your phone hacked and what you can do to protect yourself]\n\n\"A lot of people have been misled about their device,\" he said. \"I think the FTC has an obligation to give consumers and businesses the information",
      "By Paul Baimel\n\nFor the past several years, a new development in the war against the Islamic State has taken place in northern Syria, as the groups opposed to the Islamic State started to realize that their greatest enemy was not the Syrian state and its army, but the Kurdish population in northern Syria.\n\nThese groups now seek to fight the Kurds for real, and as a result they are moving into Kurdish territory to create a Kurdish state. That's a new development when one considers what the Kurdish authorities are saying, which is that they are not going to allow their territory to be divided as soon as Islamic State is defeated.\n\nIn fact the Kurds have already begun to negotiate with the Islamic State's enemy within Syria, Turkey. The United States, which has spent billions of dollars to try to overthrow the Syrian regime, is also working behind the scenes to find a way to keep ISIS out of Syria and to give the Kurds some degree of autonomy. This is why it is no surprise that the Americans have been negotiating with the Turkish government as well, in an attempt to keep ISIS out of Syria's northeast.\n\n\nThe Kurds' main concern is to protect their land and keep ISIS at bay. But they are now coming into conflict with the US-backed groups that are operating across the border in northern Syria and they need help in that area.\n\nThey can't win either against ISIS, Turkey or the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But they want to fight against Kurds for real. That's what has caused the crisis in Iraq, where a local Kurdish independence movement has grown very strong and is now threatening to push out the central government in Baghdad.\n\nKurds of Syria seek autonomy on Iraqi-Turkish border, Iraq's Kurdish officials say\n\nThe US-led coalition against ISIS, however, is a major impediment to any possibility of a sustainable regional Kurdistan in the Middle East. It refuses to allow the Kurds to establish any kind of independent statelet. The Kurds fear that any autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria and northeast Iraq would inevitably have to fight ISIS for its survival.\n\nThe Kurds cannot afford to let this happen. A large majority of the population of Syrian Kurdistan would be ethnically Arab. The majority of the region's ethnic population is Sunni Muslim and wants to see the regime of Bashar al-Assad toppled.\n\nTherefore a Kurdish state, whether it be in Syria or northeast Iraq, will always be opposed by the Syrian regime. That's why the Kurds are fighting against ISIS together with the Turks, US-backed insurgents and the other forces backing Syria's regime.\n\nThe Kurds are thus working against each other, which is why they need outside help when the coming battles against the Islamic State are over. They also face the prospect of being attacked by the Syrian regime.\n\nThe Kurds are not only fighting the Islamic State or the Syrian regime. They have also been fighting each other for several years, especially along the Turkish border. It's only since the civil war began in 2011 that the Kurds have moved into more powerful positions inside of Syria. Now the Kurdish commanders see that it is in their best interests to strike a deal with Washington. This would give them some sort of autonomous autonomy, something that they believe would satisfy their own interests.\n\nAnkara would be very happy with this deal, as it wants to crush the Kurdish militants and break up the Kurdish-majority region in northern Syria. Turkey is deeply skeptical of a viable Kurdish statelet in northern Syria, which is why it prefers to see a permanent regime in Syria instead of independence. The Syrians oppose the idea of Kurdish independence and a permanent Kurdish regime as well.\n\nThe situation has created a rift between Ankara and the Kurds. The Turks and the Kurds do not even recognize each other. The Kurds, for their part, want the Turks out of their country as well as the Kurds. This is why the Russians are currently bombing Kurdish positions and in some cases Kurds have begun to turn to the Russians to defend their positions.\n\nThis is why it is no surprise that the Kurds are already negotiating with the Turks, a move that Russia had announced two days ago during its peace talks with Turkey. Russia wants to see a permanent Syrian government, the Kurdish autonomy and the end of the bloody civil war that pits President Bashar al-Assad and the rebels against each other.\n\nThe Kurds, for their part, will only accept a regime that controls all of Syria without Syria's borders being changed. If the Kurds are to be successful they must be strong enough to resist Turkey and the regime of Assad, as well as the Western-backed insurgents.\n\nTherefore it is not surprising to find a Kurdish state negotiation underway right now between the Kurds and Turkey. This is also why the United States and the Russians are trying to break up a possible deal between the Kurds and the Turks.\n\nAnkara is angry with the Kurds, which is a natural consequence of the Kurdish independence movement and Kurdish-on-Kurdish fighting between the Kurds",
      "By Robert Romano\n\nAs much as the media and political class have criticized this year's Democratic National Convention, most commentators and political journalists are not talking about the very real economic and social inequality that the event highlighted. As this year's convention has gotten off to a slow start, the media should have noticed as the media covered the economic inequality issues raised by the Democrats, including Bernie Sanders' speech, Hillary Clinton's speech, Bernie Sanders' foreign policy speech and Elizabeth Warren's speech. And since, it is not the media that should have noticed, the media should have focused more on it, especially considering that the U.S. government has a very negative public perception of poor people in this country.\n\nThe New York Times did report on the issue of economic inequality as part of its \"The Race is on\" series, while the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have covered it extensively through their articles on Hillary Clinton's economic speech. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, as well as MSNBC's Chris Hayes has highlighted the importance of economic inequality while appearing on the network's show.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, like the majority of mainstream corporate media, is not talking about economic inequality because it is a problem that they are too easily influenced by. As The Wall Street Journal put it, this is because \"social liberalism\" is the ideology of \"those on the left who tend to believe that government should provide broad-based remedies to improve the lot of the disadvantaged, including by strengthening the safety net.\"\n\nThe Washington Post put it more succinctly, \"When it comes to economic inequality, the Democratic Party has moved far from its roots as a party that had the party platform pledge to 'end a rigged economy in which economic and political power is transferred from ordinary workers to a shrinking number at the top.'\"\n\nA large percentage of the editorial board of the New York Times, a liberal news organization with a conservative editorial page, wrote in a recent editorial titled \"Our Divide\" that \"We must acknowledge inequality is not a Democrat or a Republican issue,\" while the Washington Post has argued that \"the United States remains the economic envy of the world and the only advanced democracy where inequality is not a problem of choice but one we have imposed and made worse.\"\n\nWhat those news organizations and other mainstream corporations are failing to recognize is that they have a strong incentive to be pro-inequality, and they benefit from inequality as they reap the social and economic benefits of it. As the U.S. government has taken more of its wealth and power into the hands of the very few with the most access, there is greater social inequality in America and an economic disparity when everyone is equally or at least equally well-off.\n\nAs we see, the U.S. government is not very sensitive to the social and economic inequities that are growing in society in this country, in part because that country is a large and mostly white capitalist enterprise that exists to increase its profits in order to expand its business. But, it is also, unlike the rest of the Western world, because these corporations are largely unopposed, have little accountability and do not have to answer to their investors or shareholders. For these reasons, the U.S. government can and should be more sensitive to and more sensitive to the growing inequalities and problems that are happening in societies throughout the world.\n\nIndeed, as the U.S. has become a more unequal and unequal-by-the-way-we-do society, with a shrinking median income, growing poverty, rising inequality of wealth and the declining middle class, the media, social justice organizations, academia and other institutions that are supposed to focus on solving the problems of those with less will be much more interested in discussing how we can alleviate our national disparities rather than discussing how we can get the U.S. government back to a more democratic socialist agenda.\n\nThe Obama administration failed to address social and economic inequalities during his first five years in office, which were due largely to U.S. corporations and investors not paying any price from the U.S. government. They did not expect President Obama and Democrats to respond to their demands, or that Obama would follow the demands of the corporations and their wealthy special interests.\n\nIt is unfortunate that a few media journalists did not see through the agenda and propaganda that the Democratic Party uses to sell the American people on the idea that we have a government in place there to care about their problems, but only the problems of rich white people and not the problems facing our poor and working class; that the U.S. is a country that is great and wonderful because it is so rich, and that the country needs an influx of foreign workers to take their jobs and that we must have trade agreements that help enrich those corporations who use workers to build their factories overseas.\n\nThe media has played a crucial role in the U.S. political system and the election process. The media has long been corrupted by power in the interest of corporations and other special interests. The U.",

      "There are a few reasons why companies like Tesla and Toyota might choose to give away their patents. One reason might be to encourage the development of new technologies or to encourage the widespread adoption of their technologies. By making their patents available to other companies or individuals, they can help to stimulate innovation and competition, which can ultimately lead to the development of new products or services that benefit society as a whole. \nAnother reason that companies might give away their patents is to build partnerships or collaborations with other organizations. By sharing their patents with other companies, they can work together to develop new technologies or products, which can be beneficial for both parties. \nIt's important to note that giving away patents does not necessarily mean that a company is giving up all rights to their technology. They may still be able to license the technology to others or receive compensation for its use in some cases. Ultimately, the decision to give away patents is a strategic one that companies make based on their business goals and the needs of their industry.",
      "Muscles get bigger when we lift weights because lifting weights causes tiny tears in the muscle fibers. When the muscles heal, they get a little bit bigger. This process is called muscle hypertrophy. Bigger muscles can lift more weight because they have more muscle fibers, and each muscle fiber is able to generate a certain amount of force. So, if you have more muscle fibers, you'll be able to generate more force overall. Think of it like this: imagine you have a bucket and you want to carry it full of water. If the bucket is bigger, it can hold more water. In the same way, if your muscles are bigger, they can lift more weight. It's also important to note that while bigger muscles can generally lift more weight, there are other factors that contribute to strength as well, such as the nervous system's ability to activate and coordinate the muscles, and the efficiency with which the muscles use energy.",
      "All websites are potentially hackable, but some are more secure than others. The level of security depends on how well the website has been designed and maintained. It is very difficult, if not impossible, for any website to be 100% secure and invulnerable to all hacking attempts.

Even the most secure websites can be hacked if the hacker is skilled enough and has enough time and resources. It's a bit like a game of cat and mouse. Hackers are always trying to find ways to get into websites, and website developers are always trying to stop them.

      "The technological singularity is a hypothetical future event that would mark a significant change in human history, particularly with respect to technology. Some people think it could be a good thing because it could potentially lead to great advances in science and technology that could improve our lives in many ways. For example, it could help us solve some of the biggest problems facing humanity, such as poverty, disease, and climate change. On the other hand, some people think it could be a bad thing because it could also lead to unintended consequences or negative impacts on society. For example, some people worry that it could lead to the creation of artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than humans and could potentially become a threat to humanity. Others worry that it could lead to social and economic disruptions, as many jobs and industries could be replaced by automation. Overall, the technological singularity is a complex and controversial topic that is still being debated and discussed by scientists, philosophers, and policymakers.

      "Sparta was a city-state in ancient Greece, located in the region of Laconia in the Peloponnese. It was one of the most powerful city-states in ancient Greece, known for its strong military and strict social and political system.\n\nIn 650 BC, Sparta was at the height of its power and influence. It had a strong military and a well-organized society that was divided into three classes: the Spartiates (citizens who were full members of the society and had the right to vote and participate in government), the Perioikoi (non-citizen residents who lived in Sparta and its territories and who were free to own property and engage in trade, but did not have the right to vote or participate in government), and the Helots (slaves who worked the land and provided agricultural labor).\n\nSparta was known for its strict and disciplined way of life, which was centered around military training and service. All male citizens were required to undergo rigorous physical training and serve in the military from the age of 7 until the age of 60. Sparta's military was considered one of the best in ancient Greece, and the city-state was able to expand its territory and influence through military conquests.\n\nDuring this time, Sparta was also involved in various conflicts with its neighbors, including the city-state of Corinth and the kingdom of Argos. In addition to its military pursuits, Sparta also had a strong economy based on agriculture, trade, and manufacturing. It was known for its high-quality iron and bronze goods, and its agricultural production included grains, olives, and wine.",

These muscles are responsible for moving the bones and joints, and they also play a role in various bodily functions such as breathing, digestion, and circulation.\n\nThe muscles of the body can be divided into three main categories: skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscles. Skeletal muscles are attached to the bones and are responsible for movement. Smooth muscles are found in the walls of organs and blood vessels, and they help to control various functions such as digestion and blood flow. Cardiac muscles are found in the heart and are responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.\n\nIt's important to note that the number of muscles in the human body can vary slightly from person to person, and the exact number can also be a subject of debate among experts.

      "Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time, including temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. It is caused by the Earth's atmosphere and the way that it interacts with the planet's surface and the energy from the sun.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere is made up of gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen, and small particles, such as dust and water vapor. When the sun's energy reaches the Earth's surface, it is absorbed by the land, oceans, and atmosphere. This absorbed energy is then radiated back into the atmosphere as heat, which can cause the air to rise. As the air rises, it cools and the moisture in it condenses, forming clouds.\n\nThe movement of air, known as wind, is caused by the difference in air pressure between two areas. When there is a difference in air pressure, the air will move from the area of high pressure to the area of low pressure. This movement of air can be caused by many factors, such as the temperature difference between the two areas, the humidity of the air, and the presence of mountains or other obstacles.\n\nPrecipitation, such as rain, snow, and sleet, occurs when the air becomes saturated with moisture and the water droplets or ice crystals in the clouds become too heavy to remain suspended in the air. They fall to the ground as precipitation.\n\nThere are many different types of weather patterns that can occur on Earth, and they are influenced by a variety of factors, including the Earth's rotation, the angle at which the sun's energy strikes the Earth's surface, and the Earth's distance from the sun.",
      "Bounded rationality is a concept in behavioral economics and decision-making that suggests that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the cognitive and emotional constraints of their minds. This means that people's decision-making is not always fully rational or logical, but rather is influenced by their biases, emotions, and other mental limitations.\n\n\n\nThe concept of bounded rationality was developed by economist Herbert Simon in the 1950s and suggests that people's decision-making is not always fully consistent with the ideal of rationality as defined in traditional economics. Instead, people's decision-making is shaped by their limited cognitive abilities and the information that is available to them.\n\n\n\nBounded rationality is an important concept in understanding how people make decisions in real-world situations, as it acknowledges that people's decision-making is not always fully rational or based on complete information. It is also an important consideration in fields such as management and public policy, where decision-making is often based on incomplete or uncertain information.",
      "A sudden drop in the bid price of a security can occur for a variety of reasons. It could be due to a change in market conditions, a negative news event affecting the company or sector, or a large sell-off by investors. It is important to keep in mind that the bid price is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a security, while the ask price is the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. The difference between the bid and ask price is known as the spread. When the bid price drops significantly, it could indicate that there is less demand for the security, and that buyers are not willing to pay as much for it. As a result, the price of the security could continue to decline. If you are concerned about a sudden drop in the bid price of a security that you own, it might be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or do further research to understand the potential causes and assess the long-term prospects for the security.",

      "Term life insurance is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for a specific period of time, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If the policyholder dies during the term of the policy, the insurer pays a death benefit to the designated beneficiary. Term life insurance is generally less expensive than whole life insurance, because it does not build cash value and the coverage only lasts for a limited period of time.Whole life insurance, also known as permanent life insurance, is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for the entirety of the policyholder's life. In addition to a death benefit, whole life insurance policies also build cash value over time, which the policyholder can borrow against or withdraw. Whole life insurance is generally more expensive than term life insurance, because it provides coverage for the policyholder's entire life and includes the cash value component.Both term and whole life insurance can be useful in different situations, and it's important to consider your individual needs and circumstances when deciding which type of life insurance is right for you.",

      "Discussion of Banana Destribution Aspects Essay\n\nGeographical distribution and location\n\nBanana is a popular fruit crop that grows all over the world and has several health advantages. Bananas are particularly significant in several low-income, food-insecure, least developed nations, where they may help with both household food security and revenue-generating as a cash crop. The crop is a key export item for a number of agricultural nations, and it is Africa’s, Asia’s, and Latin America’s biggest fruit crop in terms of production and commerce (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Bananas from Central and South America, as well as the Philippines, account for more than 90% of all exports (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The EU, the USA, China, Russia, and Japan are the top importers (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Banana output worldwide is projected to be 130 million tons per year (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Approximately 87 percent of bananas produced in the globe are consumed by farmers or sold in local marketplaces. Almost a third of it is farmed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it meets more than 25% of the dietary energy requirements of over 100 million people (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). East Africa produces and consumes the majority of bananas in Africa.\n\nSpatial Distribution\n\nLarge supply growth in top exporting nations Ecuador and the Philippines, as well as strong rises in import demand, particularly from China and the European Union, are key drivers of trade (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Large retail chains from key importing nations are now operating directly in the global banana value chain. These networks buy bananas directly from growers and distributors rather than via typical fruit corporations (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The intricate web of interactions involved in the production, distribution, and trade of any given commodity may lead to genuine conflicts of interest among groups of individuals over who benefits the most from a product. Cheap bananas are frequently passed on to small farmers and plantation employees down the supply chain, resulting in lower salaries and working conditions (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Currently, the main issue in terms of spatial distribution is that large-scale banana production may negatively affect the environment, worker health and safety, and local populations. This occurs due to the frequently harsh techniques employed to regulate irrigation and plant diseases.\n\nSources\n\nMacKinnon, D., & Cumbers, A. (2019). An introduction to economic geography .

      "Women’s Liberation Movement in the Arts Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. The Women’s Liberation Movement\n 2. Music Video\n 3. Book\n 4. Poem\n 5. TV Series\n 6. Works Cited\n\nThe Women’s Liberation Movement\n\nThe women’s liberation movement that gained momentum in the 1960s was not an entirely new social phenomenon. Lee calls this a second wave because the first attempts to draw attention to women’s problems were made earlier (25). Through the efforts of small groups and widespread protest campaigns, in the second half of the 20th century, women from different countries actively promoted the protection of their rights. Bruley examines the course of this movement in the UK and notes the role of post-war reforms as triggers for females to demand changes in their social status and gain more rights (68). In general, this movement is part of the spectrum of a broad feminist idea that has influenced social and other spheres of life, including art. This paper is aimed at analyzing four different art objects that are relevant to feminism and either anticipate or summarized the events of the 1960s.\n\nMusic Video\n\nAs an example of an art object that touches on the idea of ​​feminism, one can cite a modern music video by Ava Max, a famous dance-pop singer. Her song is a hymn to feminine power and emphasizes females’ value in a world they could rule ( Ava Max – Kings & Queens ). Notably, there are no men in this music video, only women. Released in 2020, the video is a retrospective of the events of the women’s liberation movement and concerns it indirectly. In addition, this art object does not condemn the lack of women’s rights but speaks about the potential opportunities that women could achieve in their world, which also underlines the indirect connection. However, the current situation differs from that more than half a century ago, when, as Lee states, feminism manifested itself in more radical forms (27). Ava Max does not pursue special political views, but her work shows that from a social standpoint, she is ready to speak out against the oppression of females. Thus, the proposed music video differs from art objects in the era of active movement by its less aggressive and categorical presentation.\n\nBook\n\nAnother example is the book The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan, published in 1963. The author calls gender inequality “the problem that has no name” and emphasizes the importance of women’s struggle for freedom in various fields, including education, politics, labor, and other areas (Friedan 15). The book is a contemporary of the liberation movement and can be considered one of the catalysts that prompted a massive wave of protests. Friedan directly emphasizes the importance of proactive action by ordinary women and presents the image of “the suburban housewife” who cannot fulfill herself in life (31). Based on the author’s position, this is clear that she adheres to radical views, including in politics, since one of her demands is the admission of women to the ruling elites (Friedan 25). This book was a breakthrough in feminist literature, and Bruley cites it as an influential work (75). Therefore, this art object is one of the strongest from the perspective of the effect on the masses.\n\nPoem\n\nAdrienne Rich is the author who devoted a substantial part of her creative career to poetry on the theme of women’s oppression. An example of one of her famous poems is “Diving into the Wreck,” which entered her collection and became one of the vivid reflections of the author’s anxiety (Rich 22). The collection was published in the early 1970s, although the poem itself was written earlier and was a direct retrospective of the recently developed liberation movement. While Rich does not talk about humiliation directly, she uses understandable symbols about oppression, such as “the book of myths,” to show the deceitful nature of equality (22). This poem has retained its value and is considered an outstanding call for change associated with the poetess’s personal experiences. She does not express her political position directly, but the social context is clear: “you breathe differently down here,” which can mean gender division (Rich 23). Thus, this poem is consistent with the 1960s mood, although the author’s style differs from the radicalism of other writers and poetesses.\n\nTV Series\n\nAs another example of the pop culture movement for equality, the American TV series called Sex, and the City can be cited. It represents a modern adaptation of emancipation when four successful and free women have an opportunity to realize themselves in life and choose their individual paths ( Sex and the City ). It does not directly reflect the events of the liberation movement, but its background is associated with the idea of ​​the struggle for gender equality, which manifests itself in the freedom of choice. The main focus of the TV series is on social life, and political nuances are omitted. Sex and the City is a hymn to women’s independence and the result of the active work of activists in the 1960s. Thus, it highlights the success of the previous efforts, although the events in the series have little to do with those earlier. At the same time, Bruley mentions social mobility as one of the aspects to which women of the 1960s aspired (76). Sex and the City fulfills this goal and reflects total freedom, thus showing the value of the liberation movement.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Ava Max – Kings & Queens [Official Music Video].” YouTube , uploaded by Ava Max, Web.\n\nBruley, Sue. “’It Didn’t Just Come out of Nowhere Did It?’: The Origins of the Women’s Liberation Movement in 1960s Britain.” Oral History , 2017, pp. 67-78.\n\nFriedan, Betty.

      "Christianity and Islam: The Concept of Godhood Essay\n\nIt is important to note that although both Islam and Christianity are Abrahamic religions, which share a number of key similarities, there are inherent differences in the concept of godhood, especially in regards to Jesus Christ. The key underlying difference lies in the fact that Christians believe in Jesus embodying both divine and human forms, which makes him both God and human. However, Muslims believe that Jesus is not a God but rather chosen Allah’s prophet, similar to Muhammad.\n\nThe first key point of the debate is centered around explaining the key difference and reasoning behind it, where James White argues that Christ has distinct and intertwined natures, such as divine and human. Whereas Abdullah Kunde begins his argument by identifying what god or Allah is and substantiates the point on Christ being a prophet and mere human with no godly properties, which makes him a separate entity from God (Sola Church). In other words, both sides have similar definitions of God, but Christians also attribute these divine properties to Jesus Christ, whereas Muslims separate these two beings.\n\nThe second argument begins with White pointing out that both religions and their theological perspectives have similar definitions of the Creator of the universe. Both sides believe in the virgin birth, but Muslims deny the notion of incarnation. White argues that God chose to incarnate himself in Jesus Christ in order to experience and manifest in human existence and experience, which is why he was tired and need to eat, sleep, and drink (Sola Church).\n\nHowever, Kunde argues that incarnation did not take place and that it is incompatible with the idea and properties of God. Moreover, there were major disagreements on the idea of the Holy Trinity, which is rejected by Islam, whereas Christianity believes that each actor of the Trinity can act separately and at the same time work in unison to manifest the entirety of God. In addition, according to White, the notion of miracles performed by Christ is evidence of his divine nature, whereas Kunde states that Moses and other prophets also performed miracles, sometimes more impressive than of Jesus, which is why he claims that it does not prove Christ’s godhood (Sola Church).\n\nThe third key point revolves around argumentations on whether or not God can become a human. White argues that Kunde God is all-mighty and all-capable, which is why it is in his grasp to manifest himself in human form and live human life while also preserving his divine nature, which is Jesus Christ (Sola Church). Kunde’s counterargument is centered around the essential properties of God outlines in Islam, where Allah’s manifestation in human form would contradict or eliminate some of his divine and unique properties, which is why he claims that there are major logical fallacies involved in such thinking (Sola Church). In other words, as soon as God becomes a human, he loses his properties, which no longer makes him as such, which makes Jesus Christ a mere human being.\n\nIn conclusion, Christianity and Islam share a wide range of similarities in terms of the definition of godhood and understanding the unique role of Jesus Christ. However, Muslims reject the ideas of incarnation, the Holy Trinity, and Jesus having diving properties, whereas Christians uphold these concepts.\n\nQuestions to White:\n\n 1. Why the concept of Trinity is not directly mentioned in the Testaments but rather based on conclusions of these two documents?\n 2. What makes Jesus different from other prophets, such as Moses, without accepting statements in the scriptures at their face value?\n\nQuestions to Kunde:\n\n 1. If God cannot manifest Himself in a human being, does not it contradict his all-mighty and all capable nature?\n 2. If Jesus is a prophet, why are his teachings not as important as the teaching of Muhammad?\n\nWork Cited\n\n“James White vs Abdullah Kunde – Can God Become a Man?” YouTube , uploaded by Sola Church. 2011.

      "Creating a Policy Briefing Book: Climate Change in China Essay\n\nDuring the creation of my policy briefing book, I completed several stages that contributed to the quality and coherence of my project. First of all, it was imperative to conduct extensive research on climate change in China, seeking credible references and establishing an overview of the issue, which was highly inspiring for me. After that, a necessary step included the evaluation of the data gathered and the development of a summary that perfectly demonstrated the crucial points of this complication. Finally, a distinct element of this endeavor was the consideration of valuable recommendations that could positively impact climate change in China and provide the audience with relevant information about current resolution approaches. This part was especially interesting for me, as it necessitated the incorporation of received data into a comprehensive framework.\n\nA significant challenge that I encountered while completing the project consisted of finding relevant resources and assessing their academic credibility. It was vital to rely on viable sources that displayed correct information and could contribute to the policy briefing to present a purposeful and insightful overview. Additionally, it was difficult for me to create a summary of the obtained knowledge, as the scope of the material was extensive and included a variety of details essential for the overall argument. From a current perspective, if I had learned of these complications earlier, it would have been easier for me to manage my time allocation, increasing the effectiveness of the completion of the stages. Furthermore, I would have given more thought to the recommendations list, diversifying the suggested options.\n\nTo impact climate change in China, I will use the information I now possess to evaluate my contribution to the environmental conditions carefully. I will aim to participate more frequently in ecologically friendly activities, reducing the potential damage to the atmosphere (Mi et al., 2017). Moreover, I will try to spread the knowledge via the public sources available to me to increase the positive effect and improve general perceptions of this issue.\n\nReference\n\nMi, Z.-F., Wei, Y.-M., He, C.-Q., Li, H.-N., Yuan, X.-C., & Liao, H.

      "How Is Globalization Affecting Rates of Disease Essay\n\nIt is still difficult to assess the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, but economists have little doubt that it will cost the world more than the epidemic of atypical pneumonia of 2002-2003. This, in turn, means it will become the most expensive epidemic of the 21 st century. The amount of changes the pandemic brought, and the speed with which it occurred was literally a shock and a complete surprise for the world community. According to Antràs et al. (2020), “even without lockdowns, multiple waves of infection can occur in the open economy, when there would only be a single wave in each country in the closed economy” (3). The global scale of the spread of the coronavirus and its consequences have sharply turned public interest and attention towards global issues.\n\nGlobalization, in itself, creates, initiates and exacerbates various problems of the planetary – global – scale. They are called this because they correspond to well-defined criteria of globalism and relate to various spheres of public life of the world. This allows the researchers to classify such problems into groups, one of which includes the problem of health care. Thus, the coronavirus, being alone of the many diseases that humanity suffers from, has become an integral part of a common global health care problem. It happened when this disease, very quickly overcoming the threshold of an epidemic, acquired a global scale and turned into a pandemic.\n\nIn fact, this pandemic became the first case in the history of mankind, when the problem of health care has overcome not only local, but also regional boundaries and reached the global level. Does this mean that all previous pandemics were not global? Yes, that is true, although it might be hard to believe at first. Before the era of fundamental globalization, which originates at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries, health problems in general, and all kinds of pandemics, in particular, did not go beyond regional scale. Restraining factors for the spread of any disease until the end of the 19th century were the relatively insignificant global contacts and a low speed of movement of large people masses over long distances. In other words, moderate migration population, as well as spatially limited military campaigns and battles were an important reason behind the localization of epidemics and pandemics within certain local or regional territories.\n\nHowever, the situation changed fundamentally with the onset of fundamental globalization, when the basic spheres of public life economics and politics began to became fully a global phenomenon. Economic ties, political contacts and relations by this time finally acquired world outlines and an ever-increasing mobility. Antràs et al.’s (2020) research shows that “a decline in any international trade or mobility friction increases the rates at which agents from different countries meet one another” (2). Scientific and technological progress, which gave people trains, and then cars and airplanes, incredibly expanded the possibilities of movement and direct communication of large masses of people on a global scale and in real time. For example, World War I and the associated active movement of people, as well as military clashes of numerous armies, contributed to the rapid spread of the Spanish flu. Thus, it can be concluded that, since the development of globalization, the disease rates have never lost their growth. Before the globalization, they certainly were a territorially limited problem, but with the world changing, they became an acutely standing category of modern global problems.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAntràs, Pol, et al. “Globalization and Pandemics.” MA: National Bureau of Economic Research , 2020, doi:10.3386/w27840.\n",
      "Writing Methods in by Zinczenko’s Article “Don’t Blame the Eater” Coursework\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Unique Writing Methods\n 3. Author’s Individual Position\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Work Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe article “Don’t Blame the Eater” by David Zinczenko is not an academic work in which the author conducts in-depth research and describes a specific problem with an open mind but rather a social appeal. The raised topic of the dangers of fast food and severe health outcomes in the case of addiction to such high-calorie meals is revealed through vivid speech turns and emotional language. Numerical statistics are supplemented by personal reasoning, which indicates the author’s concern about the existing problem. The main writing methods that make the article under consideration relevant and acute are include using set lexical expressions and original comparisons designed to increase the impact on the reader.\n\nUnique Writing Methods\n\nSet lexical expressions designed to reinforce the author’s key message emotionally are powerful writing techniques. For instance, when discussing the inevitability of overweight in children addicted to fast food, Zinczenko notes that many of them have already “crossed under the golden arches to a likely fate of lifetime obesity.” Such pretentious language is intended to draw the attention of the audience to the problem under consideration. In addition, writing manner indicates an unambiguous position: the attachment to high-calorie food poses a severe threat to the health of the younger generation, and for many, the way back is difficult.\n\nAnother approach implies comparing specific aspects of the issue in question with other examples from life in an absurd and, at the same time, effective form. For instance, when Zinczenko mentions lawsuits against McDonald’s, he notes ironically that such a position is tantamount to complaining about a vehicle for speeding. By resorting to this technique, the author strives to show that the responsibility for personal health lies with people themselves, who deliberately aggravate their well-being while ignoring all possible recommendations. Another example is evaluating the availability of fast food compared to other, healthier products.\n\nZinczenko states that the McDonald’s chain is so vast that a child is likely to buy a junk lunch that contains the daily calorie intake than find a grapefruit at the nearest store. All these comparisons have the same and uniquely expressed goal. Zinczenko wants to develop in people a sense of responsibility for their future and draw attention to the urgency of the problem of obesity as one of the likely outcomes of fast food addiction.\n\nAuthor’s Individual Position\n\nThe article is written in the first person and is not an observer analysis but rather a call. Zinczenko brings an individual experience of fast food addiction and cites his childhood eating preferences. At the same time, the author’s background allows him to reason about the problem objectively, and calls to change the existing practices of control over the policy of selling junk food fill the article. Zinchenko expresses individual requirements unambiguously: to oblige McDonald’s and similar companies to label their products accordingly, tighten state control over the activities of such companies, and expand people’s knowledge of potential threats. As a result, all the aforementioned writing techniques make “Don’t Blame the Eater” an article that puts the idea of ​​impact above that of enlightenment.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the main writing methods utilized in the article by Zinczenko, one can highlight set lexical expressions and vivid comparisons. In addition, the author applies to individual experiences when describing the issue of fast food threats, which is another technique. Zinczenko’s position is clear regarding the need to tighten control measures against McDonald’s and other similar companies to improve public health and, in particular, minimize the threats of childhood obesity and related health issues.\n\nWork Cited\n\nZinczenko, David. “ Don’t Blame the Eater. ” The New York Times . 2002.

      "Critical and Creative Thinking Presentation\n\nThe characteristics of critical and creative thought\n\n  * Critical thinking as a subject is an extensive subject that can not be adequately explained. The characteristics are followed (Harrington & Terry, 2009).\n  * Critical thinking and creative thought are reasonable and rational.\n  * Critical thinking and creative thought are also reflective in nature.\n  * Critical thinking and creative thought generate a behavior of inquiry (Chesters, 2012).\n  * Critical thinking and creative thought are an independent thinking.\n  * Critical thinking and creative thought work hand in hand.\n\nCritical thinking and creative thought are considered to be reasonable and creative because creative and critical thinkers are always slow to jump into conclusion. They observe and analyze the given facts before making a judgment towards the issues at hand (Harrington & Terry, 2009).\n\nSecondly, critical thinking and creative thoughts are also reflective as one making a decision based on a matter has to weigh the history and the outcomes of the decisions before taking any further steps (Brookhart, 2010).\n\nCritical thinking and creative thought generates a behavior of inquiry because when one thinks of the what, when, why and where of a problem then multiple solutions and questions are bound to be raised in the process.\n\nIn addition, the two are considered to be independent because thoughts or questions raised by a critical thinking are always personal opinions that are not shared with others. Moreover, when a decision or idea is raised, it always becomes difficult to manipulate a critical thinker to sway proposed opinion as in most cases the mind is always made up (Chesters, 2012).\n\nCritical thinking and creative thought also work in harmony as through the process of critical thinking does one acquire a creative thought.\n\nCritical thinking and creative thought generates a behavior of inquiry because when one thinks of the what, when, why and where of a problem then multiple solutions and questions are bound to be raised in the process.\n\nIn addition, the two are considered to be independent because thoughts or questions raised by a critical thinking are always personal opinions that are not shared with others. Moreover, when a decision or idea is raised, it always becomes difficult to manipulate a critical thinker to sway proposed opinion as in most cases the mind is always made up (Chesters, 2012).\n\nCritical thinking and creative thought also work in harmony as through the process of critical thinking does one acquire a creative thought.\n\nImages of critical thinking and creative thought being reasonable and rationale.\n\nHow Values Determine Performance.\n\nWhy is Critical Thinking Considered as a Higher Levels Of Thought\n\n  * Critical thinking are regarded as high levels of thought because of the following reasons.\n  * Critical thinking forces students to examine issues from different perspectives.\n  * Critical thinking enables students and other concerned parties to reflect on their thought after the completion of an exercise.\n\nCritical thinking is considered as the high levels of thought because individuals examine issues from a different perspective. An example is that when faced with the issues of war, critical thinkers will consider all the possible courses of the war without basing on a single idea (Thayer-Bacon, 2000).\n\nMoreover, after completion of tasks, critical thinkers reflect on the decisions raised to reach the results, outcomes, and the issues that may pose a challenge (Jones-Devitt & Smith, 2007).\n\nCritical thinking as higher levels of thought\n\n  * Critical thinking is also used for the purposes of deductive reasoning. An example is that since all students are borders, I am a student therefore I have to be a border.\n  * Critical thinking also promotes both divergent and convergent thinking. An example of convergent thinking is the use multiple choice questions in school whereas divergent thinking involves alternative uses of test and user test.\n  * Critical thinking also promotes the ability to think in a balanced manner. An example is weighing options before coming to a conclusion.\n  * Critical thinking also prevents an individual from falling into mental deterioration and dementia. An example is that one is able to think deeply into issues and find an effective solution without being stressed.\n  * The skills for critical thinking are necessary for the benefit of citizens practicing democracy in their nation. An example is that they think cautiously on policies and leaders to implement and select respectively.\n\nCritical thinking encourages deductive reasoning as it enables one to make a general assumption that leads to the conclusion of a statement. This enables an individual to think deeply before making such statement as the outcomes may either be biased or no (Thayer-Bacon, 2000).\n\nIn addition, it promotes both divergent and convergent thinking as it enables individuals to raise questions and solutions through divergent thinking and finally narrows them down through convergent thinking. When one thinks divergently, numerous solutions are offered, but when the thought opposes solutions presented, the entire process is examined and only one solution selected out of the many.\n\nCritical thinking promotes the ability to think in a balanced manner because through it, one is able to avoid issues related to prejudice as the general solution raised based on a number of questions that have been put into proper consideration (Jones-Devitt & Smith, 2007).\n\nIn addition, when one thinks creatively mental deterioration and dementia issues are avoided as numerous solutions are raised towards the problem at hand. Lastly, critical thinking skills are of extreme importance to the democracy of citizens in any given nation because through it citizens are able to think wisely about the policies they are supporting and the attitude or behavior of leaders they select to fill the different position in the government (Jones-Devitt & Smith, 2007).\n\nReferences\n\nBrookhart, S.

      "Health and Medicine: COVID-19 Essay\n\nDifference Between Influenza and COVID-19\n\nTo begin with, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus rather than bacteria. COVID-19 is caused by a virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family of viruses. Antibiotics have little effect on viruses. As a consequence, some persons who fall unwell with COVID-19 may get a bacterial infection. Antibiotics may be suggested in this scenario by a health care practitioner. The difference in transmission speed between the two viruses is significant. Compared to the COVID-19 virus, influenza has a shorter median incubation duration and a shorter serial interval. The COVID-19 virus has a serial interval of 5-6 days, whereas the influenza virus has a serial interval of 3 days. As a result, influenza can spread more quickly than COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact on Buisness\n\nJust a few weeks after the pandemic began and before the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act became available, the epidemic had already caused tremendous disruption among small enterprises. COVID-19 caused virtually all of the temporary closures, which accounted for 43% of all company closures. Reduced demand and staff health concerns were the leading causes for temporary closures, with supply chain disruptions playing a minor role. Since January, firms have reported a 39 percent reduction in active employment on average. COVID-19 may focus on attention, but it is only one of eight major macro trends that will transform the industry in the coming decade. The worldwide pandemic will have a long-term and far-reaching influence on business, but other macroeconomic developments, such as systematic distrust, deteriorating international ties, and climate change, are still present.\n\nCOVID-19’s effects will be primarily influenced by how long the epidemic lasts. People will revert to pre-pandemic modes of working more swiftly if the time limit is reduced. People, for example, returned to normal flying behavior three years following 9/11. If the pandemic continues, long-term social consequences are increasingly likely. For example, the Great Depression had a long-term influence on eating patterns.\n\nThe Sudden Appearance of a Pandemic\n\nTo most people in 2006, the notion of an unknown virus spilling out of a wild animal into humans, triggering person-to-person transmission and a worldwide pandemic, seemed a long way off. A different coronavirus was discovered in the body of a 68-year-old man returning from business in the Arabian Peninsula in 2015. Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) had been identified as a sickness three years beforehand and was dubbed “camel flu” because dromedary camels seemed to carry and transmit the virus to humans. However, the MERS virus may have originated in bats – perhaps the Egyptian tomb bat.\n\nIt is possible that it infected humans before 2012, but those illnesses remained undiscovered. It is unknown whether the Korean businessman was infected by a camel or contracted the disease from a person during his stops in Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. However, that question probably did not matter to the 186 South Koreans who were infected directly or indirectly from him, and even less to the 38 who died.\n\nIt is difficult for the global community to invest in something that you consider to be risky. Spending much money, especially if it is government money, is a risk in and of itself, even if it is necessary to protect against a more significant risk. When there is a Sars outbreak, a swine flu pandemic, or an Ebola epidemic, government leaders and private donors respond with frightening generosity, but these types of investments disappear entirely when the crisis ends. These circumstances explain the reason why the world was not ready for a pandemic. We may be better prepared for the next epidemic, but it is too late to prepare for this one.\n",
      "Hardened Concrete Compressive Strength Testing Report\n\nIntroduction\n\nConcrete compressive strength testing is used to establish the characteristics of specimens when subjected to a weighing load. The strength is measured in N/mm2 or MPa. In most cases, such strengths are dependent upon the quantity and type of cement used in the concrete mix. The compressive stress of hardened cement is the most significant of all the characteristics. Therefore, cement is often verified for its strength in the laboratory before it is used in vital construction works. Specimens tested are usually cuboidal or cylindrical geometries in nature. Compressive strength is dependent on the water-cement ratio (WCR), mixing technique, placing, and curing. Strength tests are not made on neat cement paste because of difficulties of the excessive shrinkage and subsequent cracking of neat cement.\n\nThe general objective of this testing is to evaluate the reliability and protection of the constituents used to make the specimen. Materials used in load-bearing applications with strong compressive forces must have high structural integrity. The formula for compressive strength is the force exerted divided by the specimen’s cross-sectional area. Consequently, the specimen is likely to have low compressive strength to withstand high pressure. Therefore, the specific objectives for the laboratory experiment include three tests. First, test 7-days old cement pastes cubes in compression using 2-in cement paste cubes with varying WCRs (0.30, 0.50, and 0.70). Second, to test the 7-days old “small” concrete cylinders in compression using 2-in diameter concrete cylinders with varying WCRs (0.30, 0.50, and 0.70) using the hydraulic machine. The last objective was to test the 90-days old “large” three 4×8 concrete cylinders in compression, which had a WCR of 0.40.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nMaterials\n\n  * Three each cuboidal or cylindrical Portland cement\n  * Water\n  * Weighing balance\n  * Glass cylinder\n  * “Small” concrete cylinders Cube mold (2” x 2” x 2”)\n\nPre-Labs Steps\n\n 1. Upon the preparation of mix from the previous laboratory tests, the required number of molds sufficient to make 3 cuboidal and 3 “small” cylindrical ones were filled. Three 90-days old “large” three 4×8 concrete cylinders were also obtained from the laboratory test of a previous laboratory test. The tamping pressure was then established sufficient enough to guarantee uniform filling of the molds.\n 2. After completion of the filling, the molds were placed in moist air for 24 hours and later placed underwater for 7 days.\n\nProcedure\n\n 1. After completion of the curing period (7 days), the specimen was taken out from the water and kept in the air to ensure that the surfaces were dry and free from water.\n 2. The bearing surface of the testing machine was then cleaned.\n 3. Weighing loads were then applied to the specimen faces that are in contact with the plane surfaces of the mold.\n 4. The specimens were placed in a testing machine below the center of the upper bearing block.\n 5. The movable parts of the bearing were then rotated gently by hand so that it touches the top surface of the specimen.\n 6. The total maximum loads specified by the testing machine were recorded and the comprehensive strengths were calculated in pounds per square inch. (The load were applied with the rate in the range of 200-400 lbs/s) with careful noting of any unfamiliar features in the type of failure.\n\nResults\n\nAfter completing the compressive testing for the concrete cubes on day 7 from curing of the concrete in the moisture room, compression testing data from the different WCRs were used and combined with current data to generate tables (Table 1-4) and the line graphs (see Figure 1). Appendix 1 also designates the sample results of the cubes and cylinders upon compression up to the maximum load before failure. The graph was used to identify the existence of an association between the maximum load of the mix designs and the water-cement ratio of the cement paste cubes, “small” concrete cylinders, and “large” concrete cylinders.\n\nTable 1.

For instance, concrete is a substance, which can be cast in many attractive shapes and various forms. However, the durability of such construction material depends on the compressive strength. Compressive strength plays an essential function in the stability of structures. From the above data (see Figure 1), the WCR is inversely correlated with the strength of concrete. In this case, if the WCR ratio increases then the strength decreases and vice versa. When the WCR is low, the cement is probably containing unhydrated cement particles that remain within it. For this reason, the lower the WCR the lower it can gain water after the first 7 days, thus the higher compressive strength.\n\nThe effect of the WCR ratio is different for various concrete shapes. For instance, as shown in (see Figure 1), the compressive strength for cement paste cubes is higher than the compressive strength for “small” concrete cylinders. According to Qasim (2018), the compressive strength of concrete cylinders is lower than the compressive strength of concrete cubes of the same WCR ratio and belonging to the same curing period. In the experimentation of cube and cylinder shapes, the molds are influenced by parallel stresses all through their length compared to the cylinder which has an unaffected focal area that is unaffected by parallel stresses. In this sense, the experimental data is in agreement with the standard situations based on scientific research. According to Qasim (2018), the strength of the cube of the controlled specimen will be different from the standard strength of the cylinder. However, Talaat et al. (2020) note that it is mostly accepted that concrete cylinders yield more reliable results than a cube, regardless of the testing circumstances which is attributed to the better compaction and uniformity (see Appendix 1).\n\nHowever, such testing of concrete cylinders has varied challenges emanating from such factors as size, shape and friction. For instance, because of the cylindrical shape and size of the concrete, increased frictional forces resulted in concrete uniaxial compression and demand for more capping. The compressive strengths of the “large” concrete cylinders with the water-to-ratio of 4.0 and 90 days old have a mean (x̄) of 17.2778. In this regard, the sampling distribution of the sample means of compressive strengths is approximately normal. Since n=51.8335≥17.2778, the central limit theorem applies. Arguably, though the sample of the concrete strengths is skewed to the right, the sample average value is normally distributed because the sample size is large. The data set for the compressive strength established a standard deviation of 5.2173 (small value), which designates that the compressive strengths are clustered closely around the mean. Moreover, the lower the value of the coefficient of variation, the more precise the sample estimate. In this regard, the CV of 0.309, where 1> 0.309, stipulates a relatively high variation, thus more precision. Therefore, the “large” concrete cylinders were likely to be made from the same material.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the effect of the WCR ratio is different for various concrete shapes. For instance, as indicated in (see Figure 1), the compressive strength for cement paste cubes is higher than the compressive strength for “small” concrete cylinders. Notably, as the WCR ratio increases the compressive strength also decreases. When the WCR is low, the cement is probably containing unhydrated cement particles that remain within it making the crushing load to be more. In the “large” concrete cylinders, the experimental data is suggestive that they were made from the same material because of the small CV of 0.309, which is less than 1.\n\nReferences\n\nTalaat, A., Emad, A., Tarek, A., Masbouba, M., Essam, A., & Kohail, M.

      "Qualities and Skills Needed to Become a Teacher Presentation\n\nEssential Skills that a Teach Should Acquire\n\nDecision making and action-driven skills are extremely important because the teaching is a process that implies critical thinking(Kyriacou, 1998).\n\nAbility to establish teaching objectives must match the learner’s perception and understanding of those objectives (Horton, 2011).\n\nFinally, the teacher should be able to implement those objectives through designing topic activities and collecting lesson material (Horton, 2011).\n\nNeeds Assessment\n\nWhat do you know?\n\nTeaching profession is a challenge for communication, experience, and abilities of a person. An individual involved in teaching should possess a good command of various disciplines, including.\n\nWhat do you want to know?\n\nTeaching can be considered as a field that undergoes constant changes due to the development of technology and education theories. In this respect, specific attention should be given to skills that a teacher should possess to become a free user of virtual space for conducting e-lessons (Odden, 2011).\n\nWhat are trying to measure to determine, measure, and define?\n\nIn order to determine whether the objectives have been met, specific attention should be given to the analysis of such aspects as individual’s flexibility and readiness to accept changes. The vision of instruction should produce measures assessing teaching effectiveness and practice.\n\nHow will you collect and record information?\n\nThe information should relate to education theories about teaching, as well as philosophical foundation of teaching as a profession. Consequently, the data can be drawn from recent surveys and research studies conducted to define what attributes teachers should possess to succeed in a learning environment.\n\nHow will you report the information you collected?\n\nThe collected data will be used as a PowerPoint presentation that will be presented during the lesson. The presentation will propose a set of engaging questions and activities based on the findings in literature. In addition, the survey can allow teachers to make up a list of questions to assess teacher’s readiness to accept changes.\n\nAre all interested groups included in planning and conducting needs assessment?\n\nThe interest group are future teachers who are ready to adjust to a constantly changing setting and implement new strategies in conducting e-lessons.\n\nTopic Activity: Objectives\n\nWhat: Students should be able to define their skills and abilities that are necessary to become a good teacher;\n\nHow: They also need to outline the skills they already have, as well as outline strategies that can allow them to acquire the missed skills;\n\nWhy: Students should learn the basis of teaching as a profession.\n\nTopic Activity: Learning definitions\n\nClassroom management: a process implying organization of sequence of activities that engage students into learning(Strong, 2007);\n\nManaging resources: teacher should be able to select materials for classes;\n\nAssessment checklists and rubrics: evaluation sheets that are necessary to measure students’ performance.\n\nThe above-presented definitions should be explained in the classroom for a teacher to check the level of understanding and comprehension.\n\nTopic Activity: Analysis of Case Studies\n\nTeachers should be able to retell the stories that are based on the following model:\n\n 1. Interactive representation;\n 2. Repetition in a meaningful story;\n 3. Communicative activities;\n 4. Entertaining activities;\n 5. Conversations.\n\nAll these activities will allow teachers to understand the level of their creative thinking and communication skills while discussing the story with students and engaging them into the learning process.\n\nInteractive Representation and Repetition of Context\n\n  * Presenting Characters;\n  * Repetition of important phrases and words;\n  * Understanding the Degree of Students’ Engagement;\n  * Estimating Students’ Stories;\n  * Analyzing personal involvement.\n\nThe first stage implies the assessment of the way teachers are creative, as well as the degree of their involvement into the class discussion. The second phase provides the analysis of teachers’ ability to involve students into the attention-grabbing activity. Teacher should be able to define how well teachers can recognize students’ weaknesses and strengths. Finally, it is important for a teacher to conduct self-assessment.\n\nCommunication Activities\n\n  * Teachers should discuss the characters and events and ask a set of questions to the students concerning relationships, morale, and prevailing topics in the story;\n  * Organizing games is another skills that a teacher should master to make students be more interested in topic elaboration;\n  * Problem solving skills are also important to check through analysis of teacher’s ability to define problems and provide solutions;\n  * Composing essays and checking them.\n\nEntertainment Activities and conversation\n\n  * Teachers should recite their favorite poems and define the main problems and theme. Further, they should make up a list of questions for students;\n  * Second stage implies connecting the poem with broader themes of discussion:\n  * Teachers should develop their own lesson on the poem.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs soon as teachers go through all the topic activities, it will be easier for them to define what strengths and weaknesses they possess.\n\nTeachers should be able to define what aspects of their experiences are valuable for teaching;\n\nFinally, they should understand what skills should be acquired, including creating thinking, communication skills, problem solving skills, and readiness to change.\n\nReferences\n\nHorton, W.

      "Market Segmentation by Various Companies Essay\n\nMarket segmentation is used by various companies to tailor their products and services to the target demographic or consumers who are thought to be most interested in these products and services. One of the research methodologies developed to segment people into different groups is called Values and Lifestyles (VALS).\n\nVALS segmentation model segments all US citizens into 8 distinct types, or “personas”: innovators, thinkers, believers, achievers, strivers, experiencers, makers, and survivors (US Framework and VALS™ Types, n.d.). Different groups are segmented according to motivations and financial resources in order to predict their behavior as consumers. The outcome of a VALS test is a certain persona assigned to the individual based on their responses interpreted by the VALS algorithm. In my case, the test results were not completely accurate. It part I believe it is due to the fact that the test is not a real representation of reality as it ignores context. In other words, the data obtained by the questionnaire is inconclusive and only some predictions, such as purchasing power, can be made. In the case of Costco Wholesale, a retail company chosen for the project, our target demographic is correlated with the general demographic of Costco. This fact is largely explained by the Costco business model, with the company’s stores open only to members and their guests. Costco customers are financially established since the average annual household income of its members is estimated at $156000 (Robins, 2015, par. 5). Costco members plan before their actions and are not influenced by what is popular since they enroll in a membership program. These two facts put Costco’s target market into the following VALS categories: thinkers and achievers. In the case of Costco, psychographic segmentation is important, because products sold at Costco should be aimed at consumers who visit these stores.\n\nAnother segmentation model is Claritas’ PRIZM, which provides much detailed segmentation with 66 different profiles or personas (Segment details, n.d.). Different groups are segmented according to demographics and behaviors (Segment details, n.d.). The most common segments for ZIP Code 97006 Beaverton, OR are young digerati (wealthy younger family mix), money and brains (wealthy older family mix), American dreams upper mid younger family mix), urban achievers (lower mid younger family mix), and new beginnings (low-income family mix). The majority of households are comprised of 1 to 3 people, and about half of the people living in Beaverton have children. It is difficult for me to judge whether the data is actually representative of the real Beaverton population. PRIZM segmentation does appear to be more accurate than VALS due to a much larger pool of personas, which means the segmentation is much more detailed. In addition, the fact that the data is based on income, education, occupation, and home value, makes the segmentation scientifically valid. I would say that the data seems to be interpreted correctly for my hometown.\n\nThe most difficult challenge faced by marketers today is finding the right demographic which will help create and advertise products and services specifically tailored for them. Market segmentation is the solution to this problem. The rapid development of technology allows for better data acquisition and processing, and it is quite logical to use this data to improve decision-making. The biggest takeaway for me relative to my group marketing plan is that it is important to consider market segmentation to help us tailor our marketing messages and create a better marketing strategy.\n\nReferences\n\nRobins, J.

      "Personal Leadership Profile Analysis Coursework\n\nIntroduction\n\nContinuous personal and professional development is critical for leaders. By improving their leadership skills, practices, and abilities, leaders can become more effective in their roles and contribute more to their organizations (Neck & Houghton, 2006). Consequently, self-assessment is an essential instrument since it enables leaders to analyze their strengths and weaknesses, identify potential areas for improvement, and create actionable and relevant plans for development (Lawlor & Hornyak, 2012; Peters & Haslam, 2018)).\n\nSelf-assessment and reflection can also be necessary for developing a personal leadership philosophy to guide leadership practices and goals (Benson, 2015). In the present paper, I will seek to reflect on my leadership profile, evaluate it based on transformational leadership theory, and define goals and actions needed for me to develop my leadership potential.\n\nReflection\n\nLearner\n\nThe first theme that emerged from the assessment is Learner. According to Gallup, Inc. (2012a), people who are talented in this theme have a desire to learn and improve continuously. Consequently, education and on-going self-development are of great importance to me. I also derive value from mastering skills and becoming an expert in a specific subject. I believe that learning is vital to leaders because it can support their continuous personal and professional development.\n\nBy fulfilling my desire to learn, I could become better at leading others through building the skills and abilities required to become a successful leader (Aalateeg, 2017). For example, by reading more about leadership styles and their application in practice, I could transform my leadership for the better and become more effective in my job. At the same time, I could also use my drive for learning to develop communication, motivation, conflict resolution, and other relevant skills that could enhance the performance of my team and the work environment in my organization.\n\nIntellection\n\nThe second theme that my assessment highlighted was Intellection. This means that I like to think and enjoy activities that are cognitively stimulating, such as solving puzzles, analyzing problems, and creating solutions (Gallup, Inc., 2012b). It also means that I am an introspective person who values their alone time because it offers me a chance to delve into my mind and think about various things (Gallup, Inc., 2012b).\n\nThis quality is also significant to leaders because it can help them in fulfilling their duties. Problem-solving skills are essential for leaders, and high cognitive abilities that can be developed through continuous thinking and learning can also assist in analyzing and navigating many difficult situations (Burns, 2012). For instance, this quality can make me more effective at making important decisions during crises, as well as at finding solutions to problems that affect my team and the organization as a whole.\n\nAchiever\n\nThe third topic that emerged from the assessment of my strengths was Achiever. According to the description, Achievers like to work hard and have substantial stamina when it comes to performing their duties (Gallup, Inc., 2012a). They also find pleasure in keeping busy, meaning that action excites and motivates them (Gallup, Inc., 2012a). As an Achiever, I am good at giving advice to others and often take up new initiatives to exercise my talents and achieve new heights (Gallup, Inc., 2012a).\n\nStill, there is a particular share of concentration in my pursuits because I am more interested in some fields and activities than in others, which makes me selective while choosing where to devote my time and efforts (Gallup, Inc., 2012a). While reading the description of this theme, it occurred to me that it might be related to entrepreneurship since it entails starting new, exciting projects and working on them relentlessly until specific goals or plans are fulfilled.\n\nI believe that being an Achiever contributes to my leadership profile since it motivates me to work together with my team rather than merely managing them. By being an integral part of projects, I can get closer to the people I lead and connect with them so that we can achieve excellent results together (Kellerman, 2007).\n\nContext\n\nContext is one of the themes that were evident in my assessment. People who score high in this theme refer to the past for information about and insight into current situations (Gallup, Inc., 2012b). By exploring the history and the past, they can identify the blueprints required to understand the world and conditions that surround them (Gallup, Inc., 2012b).\n\nBy studying the context, these people can generate novel ideas and solutions by creating a framework and putting knowledge into perspective (Gallup, Inc., 2012a). For me, learning about the past is indeed crucial because I believe in history repeating itself and think that by understanding past events, I can acquire knowledge of specific patterns and facts that would help me today. In relating this theme to leadership, it becomes clear that reflection on the past affects me as a leader in two ways.\n\nOn the one hand, it supports my development as a leader by encouraging me to look at my past actions and analyze them to improve future responses. For instance, if there is a conflict in my workplace, I can reflect on my actions in a similar case and use these lessons to solve it successfully. On the other hand, this ability can also support me in building my leadership capacity by learning from prominent leaders of the past and analyzing their actions in context.\n\nConnectedness\n\nLastly, the theme of connectedness emerged as one of my strengths. According to the report, this means that I believe that things are connected to one another (Gallup, Inc., 2012a). It also suggests that I have strong convictions and values that guide me through life and that I value people above things (Gallup, Inc., 2012a). These characteristics are important for me as a leader because they influence my views and behaviors.\n\nWhile looking into a problem or a situation, I tend to see patterns that drive my decisions and solutions. At the same time, I have a strong moral compass and strive to act ethically to live up to my own standards. This can help me in choosing what is best for my team while also solving problems successfully (Mostovicz, Kakabadse, & Kakabadse, 2011). For instance, in a delicate situation, I will be able to make a decision that is both ethical and effective.\n\nEvaluation\n\nPersonal Leadership Strengths\n\nThe leadership theory I chose for the evaluation is transformational leadership. Based on this theory, my first key strength is my high emotional intelligence. Transformational leadership is rooted in treating followers individually and understanding their needs, and this strength allows me to do that more successfully (Khan, Nawaz, & Khan, 2016; Nanjundeswaraswamy & Swamy, 2014). For example, I can easily connect with people and support them, thus learning more about them and their needs.\n\nAnother vital strength of mine based on this theory is my strong ethical values. Scholars argue that transformational leadership has a prominent ethical dimension and encourages both leaders and followers to contribute to the greater good (Bass, 1999; Khan et al., 2016). In my position as a leader, strong ethical values help me to choose between alternative decisions in challenging situations.\n\nFinally, my capacity for reflection is also a strength based on this theory. For example, it assists me in defining directions for improvement, identifying critical values and goals, and analyzing the environment to motivate change. Transformational leadership is highly concerned with development, and reflection is an essential capacity for leaders who wish to apply this leadership style in practice (Bass, 1999; Brown & Reilly, 2009; Kuhnert & Lewis, 1987). By building on these strengths, I could improve my leadership and become more successful in my role.\n\nPersonal Leadership Weaknesses\n\nThe first weakness that I can note based on transformational leadership theory is that I sometimes lack focus while evaluating directions or opportunities. When thinking about potential decisions, I see too many options, and it can be hard for me to choose one. Transformational leadership entails setting a clear vision and maintaining a sense of direction in myself and my team, and thus this characteristic can affect my leadership negatively (Bass, 1999; Khan et al., 2016).\n\nAnother weakness that I have identified is that I often focus on the outcomes of the work instead of the process or its effects on people. In an effort to achieve organizational goals, I can push myself and my followers too hard, leading to exhaustion and decreased motivation. Based on the transformational leadership theory, leaders should strive for a balance between meeting shared goals and fulfilling employees’ needs (Khan et al., 2016; Nanjundeswaraswamy & Swamy, 2014). Hence, this characteristic of mine disagrees with transformational leadership theory.\n\nLastly, my third weakness related to transformational leadership is that I tend to separate myself and my goals from my team. While I set goals that I want employees to complete, my own goals rarely match them, which leads me to disengage from the team. In transformational leadership, the emphasis is on the shared vision and goals, which requires overcoming this weakness (Bass, 1999; Khan et al., 2016).\n\nRecommendations for Personal Leadership\n\nIn order to overcome my first weakness, it would be useful to practice prioritization. For example, if there are too many opportunities, I could prioritize them by benefits that they offer to me, my team, and my organization. This would help me to narrow down the vision and set clear goals that are beneficial for all parties involved, thus contributing to my application of transformational leadership (Bass, 1999).\n\nThe second practice that would be helpful for me is continuous self-assessment. While working on a project, I should take breaks often to analyze whether my needs and the needs of my team are being met. This would aid me in focusing more on the people than on results and finding the balance between productivity and people’s needs as required by transformational leadership theory (Khan et al., 2016; Kuhnert & Lewis, 1987).\n\nFinally, I would also try to engage in goal-setting from the perspective of shared goals. As explained by Khan et al. (2016), shared goals are crucial to transformational leadership, and this practice would help me to become closer to my organization and my team.\n\nGoals and Actions\n\nSmart Goals\n\nThe first smart goal I would like to achieve is practicing reflection for one hour daily. This goal is important to my leadership since it is connected to my strengths, and more reflection time will allow me to make better decisions and engage in more self-development. I will measure the progress using timers to track the time I spend thinking without distractions.\n\nThe goal is attainable because there are tasks that I could do quicker or delegate to allow more time for daily reflection, and it is also relevant to my role as a leader since it would support my personal and professional development. I will accomplish this goal by the end of the year.\n\nThe second smart goal for me is to become more organized in my work so that I can engage more in self-development and allow myself enough rest to avoid exhaustion. I will measure the progress using a habits tracker where I will record habits such as maintaining a sleep schedule, keeping the desk clean, recording tasks on a timetable, and more. These habits will help me become more organized without taking up too much time, which is why I think that this goal is attainable. It is relevant to my work as a leader because I have a lot of duties that necessitate organization skills. I intend to accomplish the goal within three months.\n\nSpecific Actions\n\nIn line with my first goal, I will begin setting aside time for reflection at the end of each day. I will remove all distractions so that I could devote proper time to my thoughts and set the timer to avoid doing anything else during these periods. I will start at just ten minutes and increase the time gradually until I reach one hour. I believe that this action will contribute to my goal since it will give me time to think about my goals, development, and other critical areas where I need reflection.\n\nFor my second goal, I will start by evaluating my current routine and compiling a list of habits that would make it more organized. This will help me to narrow down the focus of my actions while also allowing me to track my progress toward the goal. Once the list of habits is complete, I will start recording them in my habit tracker, seeking to fulfill them daily.\n\nReferences\n\nAalateeg, S. (2017). Literature review on leadership theories.

      "Key Elements of the Nature-Nurture Controversy Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Why the nature-nurture debate is controversial\n 3. Similarities and differences\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe nature-nurture controversy centers on the contributions of the environment and genetics to the development of human behaviors. Nature, in particular, refers to the genetic composition that some psychologists believe has a significant role in the formation of behavior. On the other hand, nurture refers to environmental factors and interactions. Nature-nurture has been controversial because of the differing views among psychologists and researchers.\n\nWhy the nature-nurture debate is controversial\n\nSome researchers argue that people are born with innate traits and abilities. They add that these intrinsic abilities are fully responsible for the character growth and development of a person. On the other hand, their opponents assert that environmental factors chiefly influence the growth and development of human traits.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry , researchers from the Twins Early Development Study of King’s College London Institute of Psychiatry observed 45 childhood characteristics of approximately 6,759 pairs of identical and non-identical twins in the UK. These characteristics included their IQ, hyperactivity, height, and weight. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the genes or the environmental conditions contribute the most to the development of behavioral patterns. Moreover, the geographical difference in the UK was observed in terms of environmental and genetic variations (Brierley, 2011). The result of the study revealed that some places occurred to be environmental hotspots for certain traits’ formation. In other places, it was genetics that governed the traits. In London, the environment plays a key role in the formation of traits. One reason for this is income and social status differences within communities. Twins who grow up in the same place are likely to have different friends who impact their behavior.\n\nIn a study conducted by Dr. Peter Neubauer, a New York psychiatrist, five twins were separated at birth. They were brought up in different homes, and their families were informed about the study. Although they were twins, they participated in the research study without knowing their relationship (Discovery Communications, 2011). Dr. Neubauer discovered that despite the separation, the twins had common traits. He concluded that genetics plays a significant role in the formation of human traits. During the study, one set of twins was excluded from the program because they did not progress at the same rate.\n\nSimilarities and differences\n\nThe research conducted by the researchers from the Twins Early Development (TED) Study and the research of Dr. Neubauer involved twins. This was the main similarity. However, a large number of twins participated in the study by TED, while Dr. Neubauer had only 15 sets of twins. The TED group of researchers did not have to separate the twins, while in Dr. Neubauer’s study, the twins were separated. TED’s study revealed that it was the environment that influenced the traits of the participants. In Dr. Neubauer’s conclusion, he stated that genetics was responsible for forming human traits.\n\nIn terms of reliability in the conclusion of the research studies, none can be considered to be more acceptable than the other. TED’s research had several participants. Even though the results of most of the participants were influenced by environmental factors, it remains that some participants were not influenced by external factors. In Dr. Neubauer’s study, he excluded one set of twins who did not show the same progress rate. Any form of study which asserts that only genetics influence human behaviors may not be considered to be reliable. Both genetics and the immediate environment influence human behaviors. Further research studies should be conducted in this area of controversy.\n\nReferences\n\nBrierley, C. (2012). Nature or nurture? It may depend on where you live. EurekAlert! – Science News .

      "Hairy Frog’s Adaptations and Environment Essay\n\nThe Hairy Frog is a species of frogs associated with the Central African region. It belongs to the Arthroleptidae family, the genus Trichobatrachus, and is scientifically referred to as Trichobatrachus robustus (Wells 53). Its name originated from the presence of hair-like structures that appear on the body and thighs of males.\n\nAdaptations\n\nOne of the most unique adaptations of the Wolverine Frog is its natural ability to break its own bones in order to unleash a sharp claw that offers protection against predators (Iszatt par. 3). This claw is located on its feet and only appears when the frog is in danger of attack. It releases the claw by contracting the muscles in its rear feet and causing the claw to appear by piercing the frog’s skin (Wood 23). Another adaptation is the presence of hairy strands on males during the breeding season (“The Cabinet of Freshwater Curiosities: The Hairy Frog” par. 2). The strands (papillae) are an adaptation that allows the frogs to breathe for longer periods underwater while protecting unhatched eggs from predators (Wells 48). The papillae facilitate a process known as cutaneous respiration.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe environment of the frog comprises rivers, streams, and dense forests (Bartlett and Bartlett 29). The frogs are terrestrial for most of the year and relocate to freshwater habitats during the breeding season. The Hairy Frog is common in Equatorial Guinea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and Cameroon (Wells 36). Its habitat includes fast-flowing rivers and streams as well as agricultural land. Therefore, their environment comprises both terrestrial and freshwater habitats.\n\nReasons for choosing the Hairy Frog\n\nI chose the Hairy Frog because of its unique adaptation of possessing claw-like terminal phalanges on its hind feet that only appear during moments of danger (Iszatt par. 3). In addition, the claws cut through the skin and retract afterwards. The process of revealing and retracting the claws is a strange phenomenon that is not observed in any other animal species. This adaptation is also found in some frogs that belong to the Astylosternus genus (Brahic par. 6). In frog’s that have a similar defense mechanism, the bony spines grow through the skin and project outwards from the wrists. Unlike in Trichobatrachus robustus, the spines of other frogs are permanently fixed on the wrists (Brahic par. 7). They do not pierce the skin as in the case of the Hairy Frog.\n\nOutline\n\n  * Evolutionary phylogeny\n      + Belongs to the Trichobatrachus genus\n      + Classified under the Arthroleptidae family.\n      + Related to the species Leptopelis palmatus .\n      + Related to the family Hyperrolidae (Sedge and bush frogs). Subfamilies include Anthroleptinae, Astylosterninae, and Leptopelinae.\n  * Environment\n      + The Hairy Frog is found in both terrestrial and freshwater habitats.\n      + It inhabits terrestrial environments for most of the year.\n      + It relocates to freshwater habitats for breeding.\n      + Common in Central African countries including Nigeria, Angola, Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea.\n  * Selection pressures\n      + The population of T. robustus is declining substantially. This is due to loss of habitat and widespread deforestation (Bartlett and Bartlett 31). The species has been identified as endangered and it is therefore, on the verge of extinction.\n  * Adaptations\n      + The frog possesses sharp claws on hind legs: the claws offer protection from predators (Bartlett and Bartlett 29). It breaks its bones to produce the claws.\n      + Hairy strands (papillae) on breeding males enhance cutaneous respiration when they are protecting eggs from predators (“The Cabinet of Freshwater Curiosities: The Hairy Frog” par. 2).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBartlett, Richard, and P.

      "Obesity Trends in Canada and the USA Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nObesity is a major health concern in both developing and developed countries. The major cause of the disease is poor dietary patterns, especially high-calorie intake that lead to an energy imbalance in the body. It causes serious health problems to individuals such as stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes as well as certain types of cancer. It burdens not only the obese individual but also the entire society in that it strains the healthcare systems within a nation. Obese individuals are vulnerable to discrimination in different social settings. For instance, in 2005, twenty-seven percent of American adults could not join the military due to the disease (Shalikashvili, 2010, p. 19). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one becomes obese when his/her Body Mass Index is 30 or even more. This paper gives the obesity trends in Canada as well as the country’s obesity-related healthcare policy in comparison with the healthcare policy related to the disease in the USA.\n\nObesity in Canada\n\nThe prevalence of obesity in Canada has exhibited an increasing trend in the recent past. Research has shown that the proportion of individuals in Canada who are obese has tripled in the last three decades (Tjepkema, 2006, p. 21). The proportion of obese adults in 1985 was 5.7 %, which rose to 15% by the year 2000. In the subsequent years, there was a continual increment in the proportion reaching 58.8% in 2004. In terms of gender, men recorded a high prevalence of the disease compared to their female counterparts, 65.2 % and 52.4 respectively. This marked a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity among Canadian adults by nearly 12%. Further research has shown that approximately 8% of the people that had normal body weight in 1994/95 had become obese by 2002/03. The prevalence of obesity in Canada has not only increased among adults but also among children. Children who are overweight during their early stages of growth and development tend to become obese in their adulthood. According to Tjepkema (2006), between 1983 and 2001, the prevalence of obesity in children increased by 200-300% (p.23). However, the rates among Canadian children and adults seem to have stabilized in the recent past. Obesity has had a tremendous effect on Canadians, which led to the establishment of healthcare policies to deal with the epidemic.\n\nThe populations of Canadians who are victims of obesity present an economic burden to the nation. The healthcare costs that are associated with the disease, either directly or indirectly, are approximately $4 billion, which represents 2.2% of the entire healthcare expenditure of the country (Prince, 2009, p.31). Owing to this, the Canadian healthcare system established a research policy, regulation’s and action policy in an attempt to reduce the prevalence of the disease and its associated losses to society. This policy advocates for health promotion as well as educational programs among Canadians. It has led to the development of several initiatives such as Canada’s food guide, Canada’s Nutrition Labeling Program, Canada’s Physical Activity Guide, and the Pan-Canadian Healthy Living Strategy, among others (Prince, 2009, p.40). The policy seeks to reduce the prevalence of obesity in the nation by aiming to achieve a 20% increase in the population of Canadians who are active with healthy eating habits as well as healthy body weights by 2020. It advocates for the integration of the key public sectors and the healthcare sector, access to affordable recreation facilities as well as the long-term provision of funds towards the initiatives. Additionally, the policy seeks to ensure food security in the nation to prevent the consumption of unhealthy high-calorie foods, which is the major cause of obesity.\n\nObesity in America\n\nAmerica has recorded the highest rates of obesity in the world. According to Blackburn and Walker (2005), 74.6% of Americans are obese, with obesity being one of the leading causes of death in the nation (p.207). Obesity is one of the diseases that have led to the current crisis in the American healthcare system. The medical expenditures associated with obesity in the nation are approximately $70 billion, which translates to more than a quarter of the American healthcare system’s expenditure. Wolf and Colditz argue that America has suffered a loss of 40 million productive workdays and an additional 63 million days due to the frequent visits that obese individuals make to the doctor(s) (1998, p.100). In an attempt to curb the economic problems associated with obesity, the American healthcare system has developed the ‘CARE’ policy whereby ‘CARE’ stands for Communication, Action, Research, and Evaluation.\n\nThe policy aims to increase life expectancy by increasing both the quality and the years of healthy living of Americans. Some of the key issues that the policy seeks to attain are improvement of the nutritional value of foods in major educational institutions; ensuring the availability of physical education facilities not only in schools but also in public recreation centers; ensuring more intensified research on the causes of the disease and bringing the findings to public attention. The policy also advocates for the education of healthcare professionals and students on the prevention, management, and treatment of the disease together with its related conditions such as diabetes and coronary disorders. Moreover, the policy incorporates the need for more research on the prevention and treatment of obesity. This paves the way for new methods of dealing with the epidemic in the nation. It also calls for the promotion of health and nutrition-related curriculums in high schools besides raising awareness of the disease and preventive screening of all individuals in America. The policy addresses the special needs of the elderly obese individuals in the nation in one of its initiatives-Healthy aging initiative: Eating better and moving more.\n\nComparison of the Canadian and American Policies related to obesity\n\nThere are several similarities between the Canadian and the American policies. They advocate for healthy dietary patterns that lead to the implementation of health-related initiatives in the two nations. They also seek to improve the proportion of individuals who engage in physical activities as one of the measures of reducing the negative impacts of the epidemic on the nations’ economies. They acknowledge education as one of the pillars of sensitizing people on the prevention, management as well as treatment of obesity. Both policies support the involvement of food processors and producers in the fight against obesity. They should ensure not only proper labeling of the nutritional aspects of their food products but also seek to have the proper composition of nutrients as far as packaged food products are concerned. This ensures that people consume food with the proper nutritional composition, which is very instrumental in curbing the problem in the two nations.\n\nThe two policies differ in some aspects. For instance, the American policy recognizes the special needs of the elderly people in their country, which is not the case with the Canadian policy. The American policy advocates for obesity-related education to healthcare practitioners to equip them with adequate knowledge in dealing with obesity cases but the Canadian policy does not recognize the nations’ role in providing more education to their healthcare professionals. Unlike the Canadian policy, the American policy paves the way for more research on the possible ways of prevention and treatment of obesity, which is essential in eliminating the disease.\n\nMeasures that the Canadian government has taken to reduce obesity\n\nThe Canadian government has imposed a sales tax on some types of food. These include soft drinks, snack foods as well confectioneries (Leicester & Windmeizer, 2004, p.7). The sales tax increases the prices of these foods, thus discouraging many people from consuming them. This reduces the vulnerability of people to obesity as well as the economic constraints brought about by the disease.\n\nThe Canadian government has also introduced a standard rating of several food products. This applies to all foods offered as catering as well as fast foods. The rating seeks to establish safe levels of the food constituents to ensure that they do not contain high-energy elements such as fat and sugar. It, therefore, prevents a large proportion of the Canadian population from excessive calorie intake, reducing their chances of becoming obese.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe prevalence of obesity in Canada and America has exhibited an increasing trend in the last three decades. It has led to intense financial constraints in the nations, especially in their healthcare systems. Both nations have established policies as well as measures to curb the epidemic, with their major concern being the prevention and management of the disease. The policies and measures have played a pivotal role in reducing the rates of obesity in Canada, which seem to have stabilized in recent years.\n\nReferences\n\nBlackburn, G.L., & Walker, W.A.

      "Comparing Health Disparities in Three Populations Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfrican Americans, Hispanics, and Pacific Islanders Americans are some of the leading minority groups in the United States. According to Barr (27), these minority groups have experienced huge health disparities. The quality of healthcare services that they receive is much lower than what the majority of Whites receive within the country. In terms of health disparity, these three populations have a number of factors in common. The first factor is the number of people who have private health insurance plans besides what is offered by the government. According to Edberg (35), most of the minority groups, especially the African Americans, Hispanics, and Pacific Islanders, do not have private insurance plans that can enable them to visit some of the top private hospitals in the country. The majority of people in these three groups wholly rely on the health insurance plan that is offered by the federal government. It means that when they become sick, they just have to visit public hospitals where their bills will be taken care of by the government’s health insurance policy. Most of them cannot afford the cost of healthcare services offered in some of the best hospitals such as John Hopkins Hospitals. The low quality of service they receive in these public hospitals makes them more likely to succumb to their health complications than those who are able to get the best services from private hospitals.\n\nA critical analysis of the patterns of death, especially based on the leading causes of death, shows that African Americans, Hispanics, and Pacific Islanders share a number of factors. In these three populations, heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of death. These are diseases that can be successfully managed if they are diagnosed early enough. Unfortunately, the majority of people from these three populations always detect these life-threatening diseases at advanced stages where very little can be done to spare their lives. Unlike most of the Whites who go for regular medical check-ups as required by their private health insurers, most of these minority groups rarely go for medical tests unless they develop medical conditions that may require medical attention. This means that when they start developing cancer or heart diseases, they may not detect it until such a time that the symptoms start to show. Diseases such as cancer will have their symptoms pronounced in the body at very late stages in life. It is also easy to ignore heart diseases when they are at the early stages of development. That is why the rate of survival against these diseases among these minority groups is lower than the majority Whites.\n\nThe major cause of death for each population\n\nIt is clear from the discussion above that African Americans, Hispanics, and Pacific Islanders Americans share a number of factors in terms of health disparities. However, it is important to note that there are specific health facts that make them different. One of them is the leading cause of death among these three populations. According to Gao (76), cancer remains the leading cause of death among Hispanics, accounting for 20.7% of all deaths. Most of the Hispanics succumb to cancer majorly because of late diagnosis. When the disease is diagnosed at the terminal stages very little can be done to save the lives of such patients. In such cases, the patients are put under care to ensure that they are subjected to minimal amounts of pain and psychological suffering after being informed that their conditions are terminal. In what LaVeist (35) calls providing dignity in the face of death, the patients are offered regular counseling and medication to ease their physical and psychological pains. The cancer problem is also a major issue among Pacific Islanders. According to Barr (41), among Pacific Islanders Americans, the leading cause of death is cancer, accounting for about 27.1% of all deaths recorded among this group. Just like the Hispanics, late diagnosis has been blamed as the leading reason why a number of cancer cases among this group always lead to death.\n\nAmong African Americans, the leading cause of death is cardiovascular disease which accounts for 24.1% of all deaths among this group. According to Edberg (75), obesity has been a major issue among African Americans. Research by Gao (86) shows that over 56.6 % of all African Americans are either overweight or obese. The research further paints a grimmer picture about African American women where it is estimated that 4 in every 5 of them are either overweight or obese. Extreme cases of obesity among African American population are estimated to be 12%. It is important to note that obesity in itself is not a major leading cause of death among this population. However, it is the main cause of the major killer disease that affects this population. Cardiovascular disease, which accounts for the highest percentage of deaths among African Americans, is closely associated with obesity. According to LaVeist (53), most African Americans do not have access to some of the best physical fitness services used by the Whites that can help combat heart diseases. The problem of late detection of this disease makes it difficult to manage it successfully.\n\nThe population that has experienced the greatest health disparities in the United States\n\nAccording to Barr (63), most of the minority groups in the United States have experienced some form of health disparities in one way or the other. However, the worst cases of disparity according to a recent report by the Center for Disease Control and Management have been experienced among African Americans. The report looked at a number of areas of health and the report was startling. In the United States, infant mortality rates have gone down considerably over the last four decades. However, African American infants are still twice as more likely to die than Whites. This is majorly attributed to poor maternal healthcare, lack of adequate medical check-ups, and many other health-related issues. Heart disease is a common problem in the United States affecting people across all groups. However, African Americans are 40% more likely to die from this disease than Whites.\n\nThe same case has been witnessed when it comes to cancer, another major killer in the United States. Members of this minority group are 30% more likely to succumb to this disease than the Whites. This is a worrying statistic. Even more worrying is the fact that prostate cancer is more than twice more likely to kill African Americans than Whites. Women of this minority group are also more likely to develop breast cancer than their White counterparts. The most worrying statistics are homicide and HIV/AIDS as some of the major causes of death. According to Barr (97), African Americans are six times more likely to die of homicide than Whites. The rate of death from HIV/AIDS among African Americans is seven times higher than that of the Whites within this country. It is also important to note that the health disparity between the richest African Americans and the poorest African Americans is also very huge.\n\nAccording to Edberg (113), a number of factors have led to this great health disparity among African Americans. The main problem has been discrimination. Most of the African Americans who came to the United States before its independence were slaves. They came to this country to work for the wealthy Whites. During this period, they were treated as properties that lack some of the fundamental rights enjoyed by the Whites. In modern American society, African Americans are still seen as second-class citizens who cannot have the same opportunities in the country as their White counterparts. The discrimination against members of this group has made it difficult for them to get decent jobs similar to what the Whites have. It means that most of them are relatively poorer compared to the rest of the population. In the United States, just like in any other part of the world, quality healthcare services are available in the best private hospitals. It means that only the rich who can afford to pay for these services can access them.\n\nThe poor African Americans who work as casual laborers in the industrial sectors or house helps cannot afford to pay for the healthcare services offered at some of the top hospitals such as Mayo Clinic. The poor living standards among this group make it difficult for them to concentrate on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. They spend most of their time struggling to make ends meet. They fight to get the basics. They do not have time to go to hospitals for medical check-ups unless they start experiencing serious medical problems. Poverty, coupled with low educational achievements among this group, has led to a number of irresponsible behaviors among this group. That is why they have recorded the highest rates of HIV/AIDS and incidences of homicide. The frustrations in life and the feeling that they lack a sense of belonging in their own country are majorly blamed for such reckless lifestyles among this group.\n\nThe population that has experienced the least health disparities in the United States\n\nThe Pacific Islanders, just like many other minority groups in the United States, have also experienced some form of health disparities in this country. However, theirs can be described as the least health disparity when compared to the other two groups that have been discussed in this paper. In fact, Gao (113) says that the Islanders have performed fairly well in terms of access to medical facilities, early detection of a number of life-threatening diseases, and management of chronic diseases. It is only in a few areas such as cervical cancer, hepatitis, and tuberculosis that they have performed dismally compared to the Whites. It is only a small section of the Pacific Islanders that have recorded below-average performance in various health indexes, notably the Vietnamese women. The main reason why this minority group has not suffered as much as other groups such as African Americans is that they have not been subject to massive discrimination. Most of them have attractive disposable income that enables them to be responsible for their health and wellness.\n\nMeasures to affect change in the health disparities of these populations\n\nHealth disparity in the United States is a real problem that needs a proper solution in order to curb it. According to LaVeist (90), this problem has been ignored for a very long time, and it is getting worse as time goes by. It is worrying that African American is seven times more likely to die of HIV/AIDS than Whites. To get a lasting and sustainable solution, society needs to eliminate discrimination based on racial lines. The United States of America can achieve greater success if all its citizens work together as one in fighting some of the challenges affecting their society. Denying a section of the society quality health care services because of their skin color should stop. The minorities, especially the African Americans, should be financially and intellectually empowered. They should have the financial capacity to pay for some of the most important medical procedures that can help them overcome delicate health conditions. They also ought to know more about HIV/AIDS. They should know its causes and how to manage it in case one becomes negative. Above all, these minorities should be treated as rightful members of this society to help fight despair and recklessness among this population because this is one of the major issues making them pay very little attention to their health. To achieve success, all Americans irrespective of their leadership positions should take part in fighting stigma.\n\nReferences\n\nBarr, Donald.

      "Nursing Politics and Change Management Essay\n\nThe ability to point out the need for change, execute desired changes at the workplace, address inherent resistance and facilitate its articulation is crucial in the overall wellbeing and performance of an organization. Change enhances the ability of an organization to achieve its strategic goals and missions toward sustainability. In healthcare, nurses who call for change are often compelled to engage in political processes that may sometimes be highly dynamic in facilitating change at the workplace (Barker & DeNisco, 2013). The politics and policy development calls have been significant in creating change in organizations and addressing the needs of patients. This has improved the delivery of healthcare services to patients.\n\nModern scholars indicate that nurse leaders engage in political processes to influence others and consequently achieve a set of professional goals (Friesen, 2005). McEwen and Wills (2014) argue that being involved in nursing politics and policy development roles presents the best platform for calling change. Nurses are also endowed with enough potential for improving and addressing negative considerations enhancing enhance their positive outcomes.\n\nBarker and DeNisco (2013) observe that effective leadership fosters desired organizational change by developing workers and teams that work towards the holistic development of the organization’s mission. While cautioning the mechanisms of over-relying on teams in an organization to facilitate change, management analysts concur that leaders must be able to link their visions with expected benefits that may eventually lead to desired outcomes. Borrowing from organization conflict theory, Lundy and Janes (2009) indicate that a leader must be able to operate from a much higher platform when solve rising conflicts among members. The same has been echoed by Mc Gregor’s theory of X and Y which appreciates the inherent defiant nature among individuals who work in teams or as groups. The theory also highlights the need for critical understanding in making sure that nurses employ their best skills and competencies during any process of change. Therefore, nursing leaders must provide the much-needed guidelines that keep the group members united and focused on the benefits they are supposed to achieve after committing themselves to work.\n\nThe role of any change agent in organization sprouts from the driving forces that compel an individual to seek intrinsic outsets for improvements. Basavanthappa (2007) supports the latter by citing the Chaos model in an organizational change where change must be anchored on a strong force to facilitate re-evaluation and acceptance of the resultant implementable ideology.\n\nIn my nursing role as a change agent, the driving force has been created by the need to improve healthcare provision. I saw our service provision being threatened by the fast pace of competition from other private practices. I was moved by the rising number of patients suffering due to wrong medication. Besides, it was also clear that although the management appeared unaware of the nurses’ malpractices, it did not take long before it was found out by the administration. I informed them that this could change by adopting a policy of double-checking medication before administration.\n\nNurses can indeed influence change in their workplace environment. One such instance was observed in Maryland Hospital Ohio where there was a need to improve health outcomes based on proper working conditions. As reflected in the environmental theory, taking care of a patient’s environment by ensuring fresh airflow, proper drainage and cleanliness play a huge role in improving patients’ health. The change roles for nurses involved taking the initiative to clean hospital surroundings and calling for the creation of more working space and enough ventilation.\n\nReferences\n\nBarker, A.

      "Healthcare: Strategy Development and Strategic Alternatives Essay\n\nStrategy Development\n\nStrategy Formulation Strategies\n\nStrategy Development (SD) is a powerful concept that can make many healthcare organizations successful. Healthcare providers can use various strategies in order to implement their SDs.\n\n 1. Directional Strategy : This concept refers to “the missions, goals, objectives, visions, and values targeted by a specific organization” (Moseley, 2012, p. 16). According to Ginter, Duncan, and Swayne (2013, p. 28), “such directional strategies are also called the ends ”. A good example is when a healthcare institution identifies its mission or vision.\n 2. Adaptive Strategies : These are powerful concepts that make it easier for health organizations to achieve their directional goals. These adaptive concepts “are concerned with the scopes that define the operations of an organization” (Ginter et al., 2013, p. 64). For example, a healthcare facility might decide to maintain, reduce, improve, or expand its operations.\n 3. Market-entry Strategies: It is appropriate for a facility to achieve its adaptive strategies . This objective results in market-entry strategies. These strategies highlight the best ideas that can support the above adaptive goals (Hagen, 2013). For example, a healthcare institution might decide to purchase new resources or change its internal structure.\n 4. Competitive Strategies: These strategies ensure an organization competes effectively by providing quality services. For example, a healthcare facility might use different programs in order to improve its services.\n\nA Specific Value-Added Service\n\nA healthcare institution can support its competitive strategy using different value-added services. A good example of a specific value-added service is a “Corporate Wellness Program”. This program can ensure every institution empowers its caregivers. The practice will encourage every employee to offer the best services. The “program will empower more nurses to support the targeted goals” (Hagen, 2013, p. 39). The approach will reduce most of medical costs incurred by the facility. This value-added service will support the institution’s competitive strategy.\n\nStrategic Alternatives\n\nCost Leadership Strategy\n\nAccording to Cuellar and Gertler (2002, p. 5), “cost leadership strategies encourages healthcare organizations to offer low cost services without incurring numerous expenses”. This goal “is achieved by reducing an institution’s operational costs compared to those of its competitors” (Moseley, 2012, p. 108).\n\nCost leadership can produce various challenges in different healthcare institutions. The first challenge is the loss of experienced nurses and caregivers. The above strategy minimizes an institution’s operational costs. The practice might affect the morale of different workers. The second challenge is the inability to offer quality services to different patients.\n\nHealthcare institutions should find the best solutions to the above challenges. The targeted institution can embrace new programs in order to support the changing demands of its workers. The facility should also offer good salaries. New sources of motivation will make the healthcare facility successful. The institution can address the second challenge by improving the quality of its healthcare services (Cuellar & Gertler, 2002). The institution should ensure its caregivers use evidence-based concepts in order to offer the best services.\n\nVertical and Horizontal Integration\n\nAccording to Moseley (2012, p. 95), “horizontal integration takes place when two or more institutions merge”. Most of these institutions are usually at the same level of healthcare delivery. A good example is when two hospitals merge in order to offer better health services. A hospital providing cancer care can merge with another one providing quality care for different cancer types.\n\nOn the other hand, “vertical integration will occur when two or more health institutions offering medical care at different levels merge” (Hagen, 2013, p. 47). For example, a Community Health Institution (CHI) might merge with a Tertiary Healthcare Facility (THF).\n\nReference List\n\nCuellar, A., & Gertler, P. (2002).

      "Internal Organizational Problems: COSO and COBIT Frameworks Essay\n\nEvery organization faces problems sooner or later; thus, valuable experience can be gained. By choosing between the available options, the members of an organization learn to make decisions, analyze their mistakes and learn valuable lessons. Applying the COSO and COBIT frameworks to specific cases, one can understand the problems within the companies and draw important conclusions concerning the specifics of the companies’ assets.\n\n                                   COBIT area  COSO Components    \nGroupon Company                                Control Environment  Risk Assessment  Control Activities  Information and Communication  Monitoring\nDeveloping and maintaining policy                                   ●                ●                                                \nManaging changes                                                    ●                                    ●                            \n\n\nThe Groupon Company had an issue of severe money loss due to the miscalculation and putting their trust in the wrong companion (Johnson, McMillan, and Womack). This issue was related to a COBIT area called Acquire and Implement (Program Development and Program Change); as well as the COSO component of Developing and maintaining policy and procedures and Managing changes because the leaders of Groupon have put their trust in the wrong service.\n\nThe Groupon Company also had another issue of planning the company strategy, since the company did not have any backup plans, relating to the COBIT area of Planning and Organizing ad COSO component of Managing changes because starting the implementation of a new plan requires a thorough analysis of the possible threats.\n\n                                                  COBIT area  COSO Components    \nKerviel Company                                               Control Environment  Risk Assessment  Control Activities  Information and Communication  Monitoring\nIT strategic planning                             ●           ●                                                                                      \nCommunications of management plans and direction                                   ●                ●                                                \n\n\nIn its turn, the Kerviel Company faced a similar problem concerning the failure to get high income; in this case, the low revenues were the result of the company’s shady deals, which should be related to the COBIT area of Controlling Environment and Risk Assessment, and the COSO component of IT strategic planning, because the company aimed only at getting high revenues quickly without caring about the legality or, for that matters, the morality of their business (Smith).\n\nTo make matters even worse, the Kerviel Company had to deal with the problem of knowledge sharing. The above-mentioned problem could be associated with the COCO area of Control Activities and Information and Communication and the COBIT component known as Communications of management plans and direction since the company focused on a one-time gain.\n\nBoth of the specified problems are quite solvable, though rather complex. It seems that there are good reasons for the Kerviel Company directors board, as well as the leaders of Groupon to change their attitude towards what business and organizational values are. Once the heads of the companies realize the necessity to introduce corporate values, they will learn to provide people with decent services and decently run their own business.\n\nTherefore, with the help of the COO and COBIT frameworks, the analysis of the Groupon IPO and the Kerviel has shown that the true value of a company, its goals, and its leader is revealed when the company faces a crisis. In addition, the examples described above show in a very graphic way that the true value of the organizational leadership strategy becomes clear not when the company lands at the top of the charts, but when the true company values are discovered and the real motivations of the company leaders are exposed for everyone to see. Even though both of the companies seemed to have been successful over the past few years, the first complexities that they encountered showed that financial gain at any cost was the only goal of the company leaders.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nJohnson, Cory, Douglas McMillan and Brian Womack.

      "Public Policing v. Private Security Research Paper\n\nDifferences and Similarities between Public Policing and Private Security\n\nLaw enforcement officers in the public sector have the duty of ensuring that society is as crime-free as possible. Their training is from taxpayers’ money. Public police officers are expected to serve all people, irrespective of their location, culture, religious affiliations, race, and nationality, as long as they fall within their jurisdiction (ASIS International, 2014). On the other hand, private security is made up of guards who are hired by citizens, organizations, and businesses to offer protection to apartment buildings, workplaces, malls, gated communities, and in some instances, to break strikes. Their funding does not emanate from public coffers. Hence, they are not accountable to society.\n\nFor this reason, they cannot bear the blame for not responding to an incident of a crime if the affected entities have not subscribed to their services. Rather, they are accountable to their employer and/or anyone who pays them for their services.\n\nThis situation limits their role in society as a whole to specific cases. Private security guards are not allowed to make arrests. Their function mainly revolves around deterring criminal activities through their presence. Therefore, they are required to report cases that need arrests to the police department. On their part, public police officers have the authority to arrest criminals and/or book them for further questioning and imminent prosecution where necessary.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that private security and public policing share similar goals. Private and public security officers have a duty of offering protection to certain entities. While private security officers focus their efforts on specific entities that have subscribed to their services, public officers also offer the same kind of protection, although on a wider scale where they incorporate more persons and entities, irrespective of whether they have subscribed to them or not. In addition, they require one to undergo some form of training before he or she is allowed to offer the services (ASIS International, 2014). Law enforcement officers are trained in police academies while private guards receive their training mainly from the various private security firms that are available in the market.\n\nVariation of Leadership between Private Security and Public Policing Roles\n\nLeadership in the private security sector and public policing varies significantly. In the private sector, people who are tasked with leading a security firm’s activities are selected through various processes that are predetermined by the relevant firms. Such processes are set as standard procedures in their recruitment policies. They may or may not be experts in security affairs. It is upon the management of the boards of the various firms to choose the kind of formula to use in determining the leadership of the respective firms. The management departments of the respective private security companies determine the roles and positions of their officers.\n\nThese staff people are expected to maintain their functions within the requirements of their respective company policies. Any issues that fall outside these specific requirements are considered not being part of their job description.\n\nOn the other hand, leadership in the public sector varies from what is seen in the private sector. Leaders who run the activities of the public police departments draw their powers from the provisions of laws that determine the extent of their operations. The law requires that such persons should have the necessary qualification in areas that relate to criminology. Staff members who are bestowed with the duty of selecting new officers in this sector demand a certain degree of experience from the recruits in terms of handling crime-related activities, preferably from the public sector. Their roles are broad since they cover a wide range of aspects and entities.\n\nThey are expected to handle all matters relating to criminal activities within their jurisdiction. Their roles seem to cover even the responsibilities of leaders in the private security business. They are accountable to society. As such, they have to respond to issues that are raised by the public concerning their security. This observation is unlike the case in the private sector where leaders are only answerable to their clients who have subscribed and paid for their services. This disparity saves them from any responsibilities concerning crime-related activities that happen in their backyard since such incidents are not covered by any of their contractual agreements. Such leaders have the role of educating their employees on their duties and responsibilities.\n\nHow the Criminal Justice System relates with Public Policing and Private Security Roles\n\nThe roles of both public policing and private security fall within the functions of the criminal justice system. As such, their roles are linked to the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system requires both private security and public policing to perform its mandates in ensuring a near crime-free society. It is composed of a given set of processes and agencies that have been put in place by the government to assist in controlling crime and/or imposing penalties on persons or entities that tend to violate laws.\n\nOne of the roles of both public policing and private security that relates to the criminal justice system is the deterrence of criminal activities. The criminal justice system requires security apparatus to avail any evidence that may help prosecute perpetrators of crime to the authorities. Such security gadgets usually gather evidence regarding various criminal activities that have been witnessed and/or solve in society. Leaders of this security machinery usually analyze such evidence to provide their expert opinion concerning the admissibility of such substantiation in court. Hence, they serve to fulfill the role of law courts in determining the tolerability of such cases.\n\nAnother point to consider while analyzing the relationship between the criminal justice system and the roles of the private and public security apparatus are the similarity that characterizes them. The security equipment helps in implanting the goals of the government and other private entities in improving security, a function that is also performed by the criminal justice system. However, it is worth noting that public policing also falls within the criminal justice system as one of its sections while private security is an independent entity that serves to complement the activities of public policing and the criminal justice system in general.\n\nEssential Policies\n\nFor private security to deliver its mandates, several essential policies must guide their operations to ensure that their activities achieve the intended objectives while at the same time taking into account the requirements of the law (American Planning Association, 2005). One of the guiding principles is the comprehension of the basic duties of a security guard. The duties revolve around the protection of assets, citizens, and information.\n\nA security guard should prevent, detect, and react appropriately to crimes that are being committed against the entity of his or her client. The guard should also offer direction and leadership during emergencies whilst assisting the emergency personnel whenever necessary. Although some contexts may call for physical intervention, a vast majority of their duties require them to observe, record, deter, and/or report any criminal deeds.\n\nThe second guiding principle for private security involves access control policies. Such policies seem to vary from one firm to the next. It may be a requirement for guards to monitor and keep a record of every person who enters or exits a given site. Further, other policies may cover issues of crowd control and relevant procedures that have to be adhered to while controlling such crowds among others.\n\nOther essential policies relate to the role played by public policing. The first one is the ‘acceptable use policy’, which stipulates the kind of activities that are allowable on the company’s premises or while using the company’s resources. The second policy is the privacy policy. The third one, which concerns passwords, is known as the secret code rule that aims at promoting better password security. Another policy in the public policing role is the destruction and disposal policy.\n\nOther policies include the incident response policy, storage, and retention policy, management change policy, human resource policy, and firewall and classification policy among others. The existence of these policies helps to ensure that police officers cover all aspects of their jobs without leaving room for complaints from the public (American Planning Association, 2005).\n\nImportance of a Comprehensive Security Plan and its Components\n\nA comprehensive security plan helps a company to analyze the threats that it faces to come up with the best ways of approaching them. A firm that has a comprehensive security plan is usually in a better position to devise strategies and plans that can aid in minimizing the probability of occurrence of threats whilst availing suitable ways of dealing with them. The presence of a comprehensive security plan clearly outlines persons who are responsible for the maintenance of security to ensure that they perform their duties diligently knowing very well that they will be held responsible for their actions.\n\nThis plan helps to improve the security situation of a company or any other entity for which the plan is meant. Further, the plan helps in the identification of security policies that support its goals and objectives. A comprehensive security framework enables an entity to identify security control frameworks that apply to a company’s specific needs.\n\nA security plan has several basic components. The first is the scope of the plan that gives a clear description of what the project intends to cover. The second part of the plan is an assessment of the security to explore the status quo concerning security. The assessment should reveal what one needs to defend since this strategy will assist in determining any threats that the entity needs to defend, and hence the third component of the security plan.\n\nFor each identified threat, the next step is the determination of the risk with a specific focus on the likelihood of the threats occurring and their impact on the organization or entity of concern. Another component of the security plan is a prioritization of risks. Identification of actions that need to be taken should be done in addition to when such actions are to be taken. This step is followed by the assignment of responsibilities to different individuals to perform the various tasks. A regular update of the plan is also an essential component of a security plan.\n\nReference List\n\nAmerican Planning Association. (2005). Policy Guide on Security . Web.\n\nASIS International.

      "The Tragedy of Commons: Concept and Solutions According to Garrett Hardin Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. The tragedy of commons\n 2. Anarchy verses polarity in the international system\n 3. Solutions to the tragedy of commons\n 4. Works Cited\n\nThe tragedy of commons\n\n“According to Gardiner, the tragedy of the commons is a situation in which a prisoner is in dilemma involving a single common resource,” (Gardiner 108). In life, people are faced with situations that require deep reasoning before making the right decisions. Occasionally, individuals entangle themselves with situations that are beyond their control. In such situations, people are obliged to consider a lot of things before jumping to a conclusion. For instance, a group of herdsmen sharing the same resources may think of doubling the number of their animals so as to maximize profit. Unfortunately, an increase in a number of animals is associated with the depletion of the available resources. Thus, in such a situation, herdsmen are forced to reconsider their decision. On most occasions, they end up ignoring their desires for the sake of their few animals and future survival. Therefore, the tragedy of the commons is all about the diversus\n\nAnarchy verses polarity in the international system\n\n“Anarchy is defined as the absence of a sovereign source of authority and power in the international system,” (Art and Jervis 507). Anarchy is the key problem to international relations. It is also so significant in the causation of dilemma in most states. It also causes International competition over politics and wars. It is also considered by very many people as a thing that is hard to control. On the other hand, “polarity refers to the arrangement of power within the international system” (Art and Jervis 505). The balance power theory originated from it. Polarity plays a significant role towards maintaining stability and preventing war.\n\nThe existence of both anarchy and polarity in the international system contributes significantly to emergence and existence of cooperation problems. In most occasions, states fail to come into agreement concerning possession of military weapons. Nations tend to compete against each other in production of military weapons. However, situations do force nations to reconsider their decisions concerning military warfare. For instance, all states in the world prefer pursuing their own interests to the interests of other nations (Art and Jervis 505). From the above, it is evident that the nature of international relations is anarchy. This is because there is no country that has authority over regulations of the activities that take place in any state. Thus, states deliver themselves from such dilemma by doing away with inessential competitions such as military and power competitions.\n\nSolutions to the tragedy of commons\n\nAccording to Garrett Hardin, it is not appropriate to perceive regulation as the only solution to a problem. He believed in privatization as the solution to the tragedy of the commons. According to him, division of the commons and their distribution to different people enhance their management. He further argued that the involvement of many people enable every person enjoy the fruits of the commons. Garrett described the process of dividing the commons as a mutually coercion. According to him, mutual coercion was an association that involvement human enjoyment of a given resource.\n\nTyranny of small decisions is Kahn’s idea that elaborates on the impacts of the things that are perceived as insignificant. According to him, accumulation of small decisions may result to a severe outcome. His theory is significant in elaboration of the tragedy of the commons. Just as Garrett defined his theory, the tragedy of the commons, tyranny of small decisions may result to individuals making regrettable decisions. For instance, it is evident that increase of the cattle by the herdsmen described by Garrett will result to depletion of the food resources.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nArt, Robert, and Robert Jervis.

This can be achieved by organization of sufficient resources, establishment of credible healthcare institutions and harnessing of human resource required in healthcare delivery. The main goal of human resource management in health care in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda is to provide better health care services with positive outcomes that benefit patients. It has been pursued through stewardship, financing and generation of other resources needed to deliver healthcare. However, the latter is prone to management problems. This essay will compare and contrast health care provision in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda based on human resource perspective.\n\nSituational analysis- overview of each country\n\nKenya\n\nKenya is an East African country located at Longitude 42 E and 34 W, Latitude 4.28 S and 4.21 N. The country borders Indian Ocean with a shoreline of up to 400 kilometers (AHWO, 2009). To the east, it borders Somali. The southern neighbor is Tanzania while Uganda is located in the western side of Kenya. Additionally, Sudan borders Kenya to the northwest while Ethiopia shares a common border with Kenya to the north.\n\nIt covers a total are of 84,646 km 2 out of which arable land constitutes only about 20% of land mass while the rest is semi arid and arid land. It is also well endowed with parks and water bodies. The latter covers an area of 11,230 km 2 . Population growth rate, distribution, age and gender constitute Kenyan demography. According to statistical reports, Kenyan population has been growing steadily growing over the years. The figure below illustrates population growth rate in Kenya for three consecutive decades\n\nYear  Total       Male        Female      Male/Female (%)  Growth rate (%)\n1979  15,327,000  –           –           –                3.4            \n1989  21,445,000  –           –           –                3.4            \n1999  28,673,000  14,162,000  14,511,000  0.98             2.9            \n\n\nSource: KNBS 1979, 1989, 1999 census, growth rate facts and figures 2008.\n\nEconomy\n\nKenya’s economy can be analyzed in terms budget comparisons, unemployment, budget proportion for HRH as well as proportion of health GDP and poverty. Other areas include inequality in wealth and income, labor force, growth in GDP and GDP per capita (Ministry of health-Kenya, 2006). The table below shows the GDP and GDP per capita.\n\nI ndicators                                         2006(Kshs)          Source & year              \nGDP                                                 US$ 32.417 billion  Central Bank of Kenya- 2010\nNational debt as % of GDP                           52.1 %              Central Bank of Kenya- 2010\nEconomic aid as % of GDP                            4.9%                Central Bank of Kenya -2010\nProportion of budget spent on health as % of GDP    4.6%                2006                       \nGDP per capita (in PPP)                             $1,784              Central Bank of Kenya -2010\nProportion of population living below poverty line  45.9                KIBHS 2006                 \nProportion of population with malnutrition          –                                              \nUnemployment rate                                   NA                                             \nInflation rate                                      9.2%                KNBS: Economic survey 2009 \nUnderweight children below 5 years                  20%                                            \n\n\nHealth\n\nHealth issues affecting Kenyan population are largely demonstrated in the morbidity and mortality rates that have been compiled over a considerably long period of time (Ministry of health-Kenya, 2006). Some of the major illnesses that heavily contribute to disease burden in Kenya include diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, malaria, prenatal period conditions and HIV/AIDS among others. In addition, it is important to note that some of the indicators that have been used to analyze health in this country include sanitation levels, accessibility to safe drinking water, prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, l life expectancy and mortality rates (see appendix II).\n\nRwanda\n\nRwanda shares its borders with Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It is a landlocked country with high population density within an area of 26338km 2 . It has 30 districts and 5 provinces. Additionally, two dry and wet seasons define the distinct vegetation and tropical climate of Rwanda. In 2010, Data from the National Institute of Statistics (NISR) indicated that the population of Rwanda was approximately 10 million. Projections made by the NISR indicated that only 15% of the total population lives in urban centers. The remaining percentage lives and work in rural areas (Brown, 2006). Birth rate is relatively high in Rwanda compared to Kenya. According to a survey conducted by the Demographic and Health Department in 2007, the rate of population growth rate in Rwanda stands at 2.7% per annum (Ministry of Health-Rwanda, 2009). The male to female ration in Rwanda is 1:1.\n\nDistribution of population in Rwanda according to age group and year\n\nAge Group         2007       2008      2009      \n0-14 years        42.3%      42.2%     42.3%     \n15-59 years       55.1       55.2      55.3      \n60+ years         2.6        2.5       2.4       \nTotal             100.0%     100.0%    100.0%    \nTotal population  9,556,670  9,831501  10,117,029\n\n\nSource: NSIR 2002.\n\nYear  Total       Male       Female     Male/Female (%)  Growth rate (%)\n2007  9,556,670   4,597,277  4,959,393  92.7%            2.7            \n2008  9,831,501   4,736104   5,095,397  92.9%            2.7            \n2009  10,117,029  4,880,233  5,236,796  93.2%            2.7            \n\n\nSource: NSIR 2002.\n\nEconomy\n\nSince 1994, Rwanda’s economy has experienced growth as depicted by a recent GDP average of 8.83% (Ministry of Health-Rwanda, 2009). According to Human Development Index report in 2005, Rwanda was ranked 161 out of 177 in terms of GDP per capita growth. Its goo track record in alleviating poverty has made it easier for the country to receive debt relief from major international bodies such as Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives (MDRI) and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) as well as IMF. In spite of its exports, balance of payments is still unfavorable due to quite a number of factors such as over dependency on tourism and reliance on external aid (Brown, 2006).\n\nRwanda boasts of good governance, stable economic growth and security. Its major sources of revenue are statutory taxation, tourism, loans, multilateral and bilateral grants as well as agriculture.\n\nEconomic growth indicators in Rwanda\n\nIndicators                                               2006          2007          2008 \nGDP (Million $)                                          3076          3746          4691 \nExternal Debt as % of GDP                                15.8%         15.5%         14.3%\nDomestic + External Debt as % of GDP                     24.4%         22.7%         20.3%\nEconomic Aid as % of GDP                                 9.9%          10.1%         10.9%\nProportion of Budget on health as % of total GoR budget  11%                         11%  \nProportion GoR total expenditure on health               18.8%4                      6.7%5\nGDP per capita (in PPP)                                  $340          $8666         $492 \nProportion of population living below poverty line       60.4% (2001)  56.9% (2008)       \nProportion of population in extreme poverty              41.3 (2001)   36.9 (2008)        \nProportion of Under 5 with severe malnutrition           45%7                             \nUnemployment rate                                        1.2*                             \nInflation rate (Consumer price)                          8.9           9.1           15.4 \n\n\nSource: MINECOFIN, NISR & BNR, 2009; EICV 2, (2005/6).\n\nGovernance and Political stability\n\nRwanda is headed by a president elected through democratic election. Additionally, it has a senate, parliament and a cabinet. In 2006, the country instituted reforms on public and decentralization process thereby fostering a structure that had cells, sections, districts, and provinces.\n\nUganda\n\nUganda is a land locked country in East Africa with a population of 27.7 million. It covers a total area of 241,038km 2 . Ugandan land surface occupies about 197,096 square kilometers while the remaining portion is swampy. Mortality rate during child birth per 100,000 births stands at 506 while infant mortality rate per 1000 live births is 88 (United Nations Organization, 2005).

According to a report finding by World Bank in 2002, absolute poverty in Uganda had reduced by 21% owing to its proper allocation of resources to health, education and other social needs (Anon, 2002).\n\nGovernance and political stability\n\nPolitically, Uganda has three organs of governance namely the judiciary, legislature and an executive. It is headed by a president supported by a cabinet of ministers. The legislature addresses issues such as sanitation, water, education and health. Additionally, the judiciary tackles contentious issues regarding implementation of heath policies (United Nations Organization, 2005).\n\nComparisons\n\nHealth Systems and services\n\n  * Public\n      + In Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, the public health care system services are effective and resources are availed from the community to national level.\n  * Private\n      + Kenya and Uganda partly supports private health care systems while Rwanda does not support.\n  * Financial\n      + Financial resources to tackle health issues are not adequate in all the three counties owing to poverty and slow economic growth.\n  * Insurance\n      + Uganda health care and human resource department lacks health insurance for the public while Kenya and Rwanda have insurance cover on public health.\n  * Governance\n      + All the three countries receive support from government in terms of offering health care policies and governance from health sectors and the government\n  * Hospital\n      + Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda lack enough hospitals to take care of overwhelming number of patients.

      "Advanced Pathophysiology: Geriatric Patient Essay\n\nGeriatric patients experience multisystem failure, largely as a result of body fragility and susceptibility to numerous illnesses. When Elli Baker, who is aged 73-years, was transferred to the Emergency Room(ER), the nurse noted a few details before she became unresponsive. Therefore, for the nurse to carry out an assessment of Elli’s homeostasis, oxygenation and level of pain, specific medical and clinical procedures need to be followed. The patient’s assumptions about her body functional and biological status need to be made and for the actual revelation of the patient’s nature of the problem, direct assessment is required.\n\nThe assessment process will start with the utilization of the ECOG performance status (PS) scale or popularly known as the Karnofsky scale, which will enable the nurse to assess the patient’s level and capability to withstand therapy (Browner, n.d). Thereafter, the nurse together with other Geriatricians will need to utilize a combination of performance scales and a global direct assessment, one of which is the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment-CGA (Browner, n.d).\n\nWhile carrying out this direct assessment, it is always medically recommended to adhere to the eight domains of direct assessment, which include “function, comorbidities, cognition, emotion, geriatric syndrome, nutrition, pharmacy, and socioeconomic status” (Browner, n.d, p.1). Carrying out the direct assessment specified tools such as “Charison Comorbidity Index, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatrics (CIRS-G), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Folstein Mini-Mental Status are used” (Browner, n.d, p.1). Other tools will include FACES rating scale which utilizes facial expressions to rate the patient’s level of pain and SLUMS scales for geriatric syndromes.\n\nPhysical assessment for the patient should involve a review of all systems, vital signs, examination of the eyes, skin, lungs, cardiovascular system, head and neck, musculoskeletal system, abdomen and neurologic system (Hutchinson and Sleeper, 2010). In addition, typical vital signs to assess include blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, and pain where the practitioner should evaluate the patient to locate the type of pain the patient is experiencing.\n\nAbout blood pressure, the practitioner needs to select the correct size cuff, for instance, one which is small, regular or large and it is advisable to inflate the cuff to approximately 200 mmHg or higher than this before deflating the cuff (Hutchinson and Sleeper, 2010). Further, a full medication assessment of the patient is essential. This can be done through assessment of the patient’s current use of prescription drugs and over-the-counter vitamins, supplements, and herbal medications coupled with the patient’s pharmacy contact information (Hutchinson and Sleeper, 2010).\n\nNumerous technological tools exist that are utilized in treating geriatric patients. For instance, about Elli Baker, to determine her basic activity of daily living (ADL), two popular instruments are used; the Barthel ADL and Katz index of ADL (Luk, Or and Woo, 2000). In addition, to determine her instrumental ADL (IADL), the Lawton IADL scales will be used. With regard to her cognitive function an instrument known as Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) and the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) will be used (Luk, Or and Woo, 2000).\n\nTo assess her depression level, popular tools such as; Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Selfcare (D), and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale will be used (Luk, Or and Woo, 2000). To assess her gait and balance, two important tools will be utilized; the Berg balance scales (BBS) and the Timed Up and Go Test-TUG (Hutchinson and Sleeper, 2010). Utilization of these tools has been preferred due to their ability to effectively measure the severity of the disease in a geriatric patient while at the same time, detect changes. As a result, a comprehensive assessment of the patient becomes possible, which in turn enables the medical practitioners to administer appropriate medication and treatment to the patient.\n\nAbout data collection and how it was prioritized in the case of Elli Baker, first data collection processes involved the collection of data concerning the patient’s past medical history, family history, nutritional history, social history and miscellaneous history. The data collected in this case was important in that, it formed the basis upon which clinical pathways and treatment for the patient could take place.\n\nDeveloping a clinical pathway for the patient was found to be important in that, the patient’s medical problems were quickly identified, and implementation of the clinical pathway led to minimal level of care for the geriatric patient. Furthermore, clinical pathway guidelines provided many opportunities to device individualized care systems for the patient, which in essence, are unique and meet the expectations and needs of the patient.\n\nAssessing pain for a geriatric patient who is alert may proceed as follows: first, start by asking the patient key questions and noting his or her response to the pain, for example, ask him or her to describe the duration, severity and source of his or her pain. At the same time, it is important to look for physiologic or behavioral clues manifested by the patient as a result of pain’s severity (Williams and Wilkins, 2003). In addition, it is always recommended to tailor the questions to the patient’s cognitive level and allow sufficient time for the older patient to respond. Further, advice given is that, it is always important to consider the patient descriptions and the practitioner’s own observation of the patient’s physical and behavioral responses in order to properly assess pain (Williams and Wilkins, 2003).\n\nSuggested questions to ask an alert geriatric patient in pain include: “where is the pain located, how long does it last, how often does it occur, what does the pain feel like, what relieves the pain or makes it worse, how do you usually get relief from it?” (Williams and Wilkins, 2003, p.435). Furthermore, the practitioner should ask the patient to rank his or her pain on a scale of zero to10 where zero indicates lack of pain while 10 indicates the worst pain level (Williams and Wilkins, 2003).\n\nFor a patient who is not alert, pain assessment may include does the patient needs aggressive airway management or pharmacologic intervention; how is the patient breathing, is it labored, shallow, fast, or effective; how are the patient’s oxygen saturation and bedside glucose? In addition, what are his or her heart rate/rhythm and pulse ox; does the patient manifest chest pains, headache, difficulty breathing, speaking or even concentrating; does the patient manifest insomnia, restlessness, nausea or vomiting? (Keim, 2004).\n\nManagement of pain among geriatric patients is always a failure due to a lack of proper assessment of pain and sometimes underreporting by the affected patients. To manage pain in the above patient, the concerned practitioner must provide required and adequate analgesia to the patient by understanding various types of pain, both nociceptive and neuropathic; and subsequently utilizing nonopioid, opioid and adjuvant medication (Cavalieri, 2007).\n\nFor pain management to be successful for the geriatric patient, the practitioner is required to know the patient’s habits, baseline cognition, baseline organ function, cardiovascular function, and social stresses. Further, effective communication is necessary to achieve pain management goals. Overall, successful pain, management for geriatric patients constitutes effective and appropriate pain assessment where the patient should be part of the pain management plan. Moreover, when the pain assessment goals can be fulfilled with fewer indications of failures, then the pain management plan is said to be successful.\n\nThe overall lesson I have learned concerning the assessment of the geriatric patients is that the assessment should involve medical, family, social, sexual, nutritional and miscellaneous history where also the assessment process involves assessment of: cardiovascular system, respiratory system, musculoskeletal system, neurological system, gastrointestinal system, renal system, and integumentary system (Hutchinson and Sleeper, 2010). For effective care of geriatric patients, a collaborative team of health care providers is needed. The team generally involves a physician, NP, PA, social worker, psychologist, and other numerous therapy specialists.\n\nReferences\n\nBrowner, I. (N.d). Applications in Geriatric Oncology.

      "Understanding the Effects of Quantity of Light on Plants Growth Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Observation\n 3. Hypothesis\n 4. Predictions\n 5. Experiment and Methods\n 6. Results\n 7. Discussion and Conclusion\n 8. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe healthy growth of plants is inarguably limited by the factors existing in the macro-environment. Available literature reveals that one of the most fundamental factors in the external environment that affects every single aspect of plants is light (Doll, 2007). Without adequate light, a plant can neither grow nor reproduce. A multiplicity of other environmental factors, including soil composition, humidity and rainfall patterns inexorably constrains the healthy growth of plants if they become more or less than ideal (Hall & Rao, 1999). External factors are also known to be responsible for the physical distribution of plants. For instance, only plants adapted to certain amounts of acid concentrations in the soil and limited amounts of water can survive in deserts.\n\nLight has three foremost aspects that influence plant growth and development – quantity, length, and quality. The term ‘light quantity’ is basically used to refer to the strength and concentration of sunlight, and fluctuates with seasons (Hall & Rao, 1999). In many regions across the world, the maximum concentration of sunlight is found during the summer season, while the minimum is present in winter. Maximum sunlight, up to a given point, gives plants an enhanced capacity to produce their food through a process known as photosynthesis.\n\nObservation\n\nSome flowering plants meant to decorate the researcher’s house had been placed in two separate rooms after being purchased from the market. One had been placed in a vase and left in the well-lit living room while the other had also been placed in a vase and taken to the dimly lit bedroom. The only source of light to the bedroom was only through a small window, which was left shut most of the times. However, tiny streaks of sunlight still penetrated through. After a few days, the researcher noticed that the plant placed in the bedroom had grown abnormally tall and tended to bend towards the window. However, the plant in the living room was growing normally, and in an upright position. What could have caused the plant in the bedroom to grow abnormally and bend towards the window? This formed the basis for the inquiry.\n\nHypothesis\n\nA hypothesis can be described as a rationally testable justification for the observed phenomena. In devising an effective hypothesis, the researcher must endeavor to come up with preliminary suggestions aimed at clarifying the causes of the noted observations (Carter, 2004). This study was guided by the following hypothesis:\n\n  * H1: The plant in the bedroom was in need of adequate sunlight to produce its food and therefore it had to grow extremely taller and bend towards the only source of light to have access to its only source of livelihood.\n\nPredictions\n\nBased on the stated hypothesis, my predictions for the experiment included:\n\n 1. If it is indeed true that plants react to the quantity of sunshine, then I should be able to observe significant changes in leaf color\n 2. If it is true that plants react to the quantity of sunlight, then the length and stem will continue to grow abnormally until such a time when the plant will have adequate light to generate enough food\n 3. If it true that plants react to the quantity of sunlight, then the plants in my experimental group will continue to bend towards the sources of light while those in the control group will continue to grow upwardly.\n\nExperiment and Methods\n\nTo set up the experiment, the researcher went back to the market and bought six healthy plants more or less of equal height. However, he took a precautionary step to quantitatively measure the heights of individual plants and record the figures. According to the measurements, the smallest plant was 45 CM while the tallest was 46 CM, a difference of only one CM. Conventional approaches in the Scientific Method demand that two simultaneous groups – control and experimental – be involved in any scientific inquiry to effectually compare and contrast the observations between the groups. The two groups must be treated in equal terms except for the phenomena or variable under investigation for the sake of objectivity and generalization of the experiment’s results (Carter, 2004). In conceptualizing the variables for the experiment, the source of the light became the independent variable while the direction of bend, length of stem, and leaf colour became dependent variables for both the experimental and control group.\n\nFour of the six plants were put in an enclosed structure and grown under precisely the same conditions. The remaining two formed the control group, and were also given the same treatment as the experimental group except for the fact that they were allowed adequate sunlight to satisfy their food demands. After 3 days, 2 of the plants in the enclosed structure were introduced to some light from the left while the other two from the right. All the other conditions were kept constant for a period of two weeks. On daily basis, the researcher collected data on the color of the leaves, the height of the plants, and the direction of bend in the two groups – experimental and control\n\nResults\n\nAfter two weeks, the two plants with light introduced from the left had already bended towards the left, while the other two with light introduced from the right similarly bended to the right. The control group growth was vertically inclined, the same way it was before the experiment. The sources of light in the experimental group did not affect the length of stems since all the four plants enlarged in length in just about the same quantities. However, plants from the experimental group were 4.7 to 4.9 CM taller than those in the control group after the experiment. The leaves of all plants retained their green color\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nThe hypothesis that ‘plants in my bedroom are bending towards the window to secure enough light for food generation through photosynthesis’ was proved right by the experiment. Two of the experiment’s prediction’s, increase in length of stem and bending towards the source of light were also confirmed. The prediction that quantity of light affected the colour of leaves was proved wrong since no significant change of leaf colour was noted. However, the leaves in the two sets of the experimental group turned straight towards the sources of light. It is therefore prudent to underscore the fact that the relationship between light and the capacity of plants to grow is an intricate one since plants completely depend on the light to generate their food. Further research is needed into how the colour of light affects plants growth.\n\nReference List\n\nCarter, J.S. (2004). The scientific method . Web.\n\nDoll, A. (2007).

      "Agency Termination and Process of Repossession Essay\n\nThe contractors’ recruitment provides flexibility to the employers and gives them complete control over any business management changes; it is a great opportunity for the executives to adapt to market changes under the pressure of time and workload. Nevertheless, to hire a contractor, it is necessary to follow some important tips, such as, have a team within the organization to specialize in the contractor’s project; reviewing the contractor’s agreement in case of long term cooperation concerning all the running schedule points; and document all the meetings and deals made by the contractor. The issues identified above should have been the key elements in Aker’s recruitment activities. The immediate termination of the agency can put his business under the threat of bearing responsibility for all Potter’s operations with 200 customers. (Osten, M. and Kanter, 2006)\n\nThe termination of the agency is to be correctly fulfilled for the employer to protect his liability from the customers and employees; the termination process covers the following steps: mutual agreement – the parties are to agree to terminate the agency relationship; achieved purpose – in case the workers being hired for definite tasks fulfilled them, the termination of relationships is done automatically; time-lapse – the period of agent’s tasks fulfillment is set in the contract; events occurrence – in case of bankruptcy, death or insanity, the termination is automatic. (Emerson, 2003) Agency termination is considered to be a complicated process; in case of its mistakes, the employer sticks to employment law and breach of contract. It is necessary to underline the fact that after the contractual relationship and agency termination, the commercial representative has the right to claim against compensation if he loses his commission claim in case of transaction continuation with canvassed customers. Potter is to follow all the terms of proper termination of the agency not to bear responsibility for Aker’s operations with the customers and their contractual relationship. In case of contracts or agreement absence, the employment and agency termination can take place by Employment at Will Doctrine.\n\nThe process of repossession is to cover the strict following of regulations under the agency law; the case study under analysis touched property repossession by the employee; it is necessary to evaluate his potential liability of this operation. Al Agent is to check the contract before the repossession commitment for him to avoid legal troubles; the document must cover all the points of mutual agreement, in the case of terms breakage, the parties bear responsibility by agency law. This case is to be analyzed through the principal’s liability for the agent’s torts. It should be stressed that the principle is to authorize the commission being tortfeasor liable. In case the agent demonstrates no actions for the principle, then he is to present them personally. The principle is liable for the agent’s torts being committed within the authority’s scope. If the tort does not occur during employment performance, the principle is not liable for it. (Cheeseman, 2006)\n\nThe principle’s liability on the agent’s contract is dependant on the agent’s authority. In the case of broker contracting as an agent for the definite principle, the latter is entirely liable to the contract’s party. “It is a general principle of the law of agency that a principal is not bound by the acts of the agent not within the actual or apparent scope of the agency, simply because the agent falsely asserts that they are within it”. (Cheeseman, 312)\n\nReferences\n\nCheeseman, H. R. Business law: legal environment, online commerce, business ethics, and international issues. Sixth Edition.

      "Hospice Care in Kenya and the United Kingdom Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Hospice in Kenya and United Kingdom\n 3. Differences and Similarities\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Works cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nHospice Foundation of America (2007) stated that: “Hospice is a special concept of care designed to provide comfort and support to patients and their families.” HFA further explains that for one to qualify for hospice he/she must be having a life expectancy of six months or less and this type of care may even continue for more than six months but this normally requires a physician’s certification. English and Gong (2001) defined hospice as: “a concept of care in which the physical, psychological, spiritual and social needs of the terminally ill patient and his or her family are met”. According to them, hospice offers palliative care to the chronically ill with the center of attention being pain management and other symptoms that arise as a result of a terminal illness. It is not geared towards curative treatment.\n\nHospice in Kenya and United Kingdom\n\nIn this discussion, hospice services in Kenya and the United Kingdom will be discussed. Hospice in Kenya started in the year 1991 with the establishment of the Nairobi Hospice. Initially, hospice care was for terminally ill cancer patients, this has changed over years to cover care for AIDS sufferers. Rural settings have not been left behind with other hospice services such as home care setup (Bird, 2002). Currently, there are 17 hospice centers in Kenya under the national association known as Kenya Hospice and Palliative Care Association (KEHPCA, 2009).\n\nHospice in the UK has an umbrella body known as the National Council for Palliative Care (NCPC); this includes England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Hospice and palliative care in the UK is offered in health care and social settings. Hospice services are provided for clients across all age groups, i.e. the children, youth, and adults including the elderly (NCPC, 2009).\n\nDifferences and Similarities\n\nHospice care in the UK as compared to hospice in Kenya is more developed and at a ‘mature’ and advanced level. Owing to the early history of its early development way before Kenya’s hospice, it has undergone more advances that have ensured high-quality care and a wide variety of services. In Kenya, initially, it focused on Cancer patients and currently includes even AIDS sufferers, this shows that it is still ‘young’ as compared to hospice in the UK which covers a wide range of terminal and chronic illnesses. In the UK, youth and children are well established and developed, this is not the case in Kenya who has no hospice care specifically for these special groups. The UK hospice has an ethical committee that specifically deals with ethical issues; this demonstrates the high level of quality and integrity of services offered. The Kenyan case is so different in that the ethical, and or professional conduct is guided by those codes of conduct of the professionals involved; there is none specifically for hospice.\n\nAs already mentioned, in both countries, there is an umbrella body that guides and controls hospice services. Kenya’s health care system is similar to that of the UK and therefore is similar in terms of training hospice professionals. Most training agencies come from the UK. The type of hospice services is similar in both countries; they are both guided by similar practices.\n\nConclusion\n\nHospice is an integral part of health care that is spreading its wings worldwide with new standards of care and practice being developed hence living the better option in the provision of end life care to dying patients.\n\nWorks cited\n\n 1. “Hospices.” Kenya Hospice and Palliative Care Association. 2009.\n 2.

      "The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Abstract\n 2. The First Case\n 3. The Second Case\n 4. The Third Case\n 5. The Fourth Case\n 6. Class Action Lawsuit\n 7. Works Cited\n\nAbstract\n\nAssessing the importance of law in Canada, it can be said that jurisprudence became essentially vital for its practice, with the establishment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ( the Charter hereinafter). The Charter makes the moral justification of legal norms and decisions the main part of Canadian law. Accordingly, Canadian courts do not have a choice other than to examine the fundamental meanings of specific terms’ morals, such as freedom of expression, equality, human safety, etc, to determine whether a specific part of the legislation or legal norm is compatible with the Charter or not.\n\nAn important part of the Charter is contained in its first section, which basically can be interpreted as a declaration of a guarantee of the rights and freedoms, contained within the Charter. The inclusion of certain conditions in this section, such as stating that the rights and freedoms are guaranteed “only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society” (Constitution Acts 2009), allows the interpretation of this section to be used as a limit of these rights.\n\nIn that regard, the examination of the “reasonable limits” in the court might lead to instances, where the judgment on the lack of reasonability in limits “justified in a free and democratic society”, is only about finding a loophole to justify infringing the freedoms and the rights. Thus, the challenges before the court in certain cases revolve around living up to the expectations of the Charter maintaining the balance between freedoms and rights, and the law. In that regard, the analysis of the following cases in this paper will be addressed toward examining the implementation of the first section of the Charter in practice, stating that the section’s main purpose is the protection of infringement rather than its justification.\n\nThe First Case\n\nThe first case, Montréal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc. (2005) was concerned with the appeal lodged by the City of Montreal on the decision of the Superior Court, which quashed the conviction of 2952-1366 Québec Inc., a strip club accused of producing noises on the street. The decision was based on the infringement of the respondent’s, i.e. the club, freedom of expression, a decision which the City of Montreal appealed, and which was subsequently dismissed. The dismissal of the case was based on the fact of infringement of the freedom of expression under s.2 (b) of the Charter, which states that everyone has the fundamental freedom “of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication”.\n\nIt can be seen that the noise produced by the club was falling under reasonable limits which guarantees the protection of the fundamental rights. In that regard, the appeal of the City’s municipal lacked a justification, which in connection to article 9(1) in by‑law concerning noise, did not pass the test of justifying the infringement. It can be said that the justification was lacking in the part that establishes that the issue is pressing and substantial, while merely relying on the fact that the measure will minimally impair the freedom of expression, as the club owners can advertise their business using other means.\n\nIt can be stated that the dismissal of the appeal was based on the Charter. In that regard, the infringement of law was not justified, because the infringement was not measured on the scale of this particular case of the club, but rather on the scale of Montrealers in general.\n\nThe Second Case\n\nThe second case, Ramsden v. Peterborough (1993), was concerned with the appeal lodged on the decision prohibiting postering on public property and charging Kenneth Ramsden under the by-law of such offenses. The appeal was based on that the prohibition infringed the freedom of expression under s. 2(b) of the charter. The appeal was dismissed and the infringement was not justified by the court (Ramsden v. Peterborough, 1992).\n\nApplying the Oaks test (R. v. Oakes, 1986), it can be seen that the act of infringement met all the required conditions, but one, where postering on poles is a pressing and substantial issue, the mean, i.e. the prohibition, is directly connected to the objective, i.e. the safety of the workers and the preservation of the city’s aesthetic, the minimal impairment of rights, i.e. the ability to advertise using means other than postering on poles. The condition which was missing was related to the proportionality of infringement and the objective.\n\nIn that regard, it can be stated that the infringement of the rights cannot be justified in favor of safety issues, social concerns, and the preservation of the visual style of the city. It should be mentioned that the measurement of proportionality could be applied in the case, and which shows the extent of infringing on the long term. It can be seen that in case the right was not infringed, the lawsuit can be used as a precedent in issues related to freedom of visual expression on properties.\n\nOn the other hand, the infringement of the right and the complete ban on the visual expression would extend to “trees, all types of poles, and all other public property” (Ramsden v. Peterborough, 1993). Accordingly, it can be seen that the second case used section one of the Charter to control and limit the infringement, rather than the opposite.\n\nThe Third Case\n\nIn Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys (2007), the case was related to the infringement of the fundamental right under s. 2(a) of the Charter, which is the freedom of expression. The case revolved around the appeal lodged by Balvir Singh Multani and his son, both are orthodox Sikhs, whose religion requires them to wear a kirpan, a religious object, and a dagger, all of the time. An initial agreement was held between the school and Multani, allowing his son to wear the kirpan at school, provided that he sealed it while being there. The agreement was not ratified by the school board, to which Multani appealed on the basis that the actions of the school board infringed the Charter of rights. The appeal was allowed, as the infringement was not justified.\n\nApplying the Oaks test, it can be seen that the missing condition is the minimal impairment of the rights, where the measure was of big significance to Multani’s son, through either abandoning a significant religious practice or missing the school. Accordingly, it was stated in the case that the board did not examine the reasonableness of the limits indicated in the first section of the charter, where the agreement on wearing the kirpan under certain conditions was a solution that was met upon, and which the board did not consider. It can be stated that the infringement of the right was not justified, and accordingly, the ruling of the court, in this case, can be considered objective. Thus, the third case also used the first section of the Charter to limit the infringement of rights by law, or in this case, by an administrative decision.\n\nThe Fourth Case\n\nIn the fourth case, R. v. Butler (1992), the main issue was related to the appeal lodged by Donald Victor Butler stating that the right to possess obscene material is protected under the s.2 (b) of the Charter, a right that was infringed by section 163 of the Criminal code, based on which he was accused and convicted (R. v. Butler, 1992). The court upheld the decision that the rights were infringed, but justified under s. 1 of the Charter.\n\nThe application of the Oaks test outlines the main condition to consider in this case, which is the issue being of pressing and substantial concern for society. Accordingly, the link between the mean and the objective was established, the infringement and the objective were proportional and there was minimal impairment of rights in the case. The point of controversy might be seen in the classification of the obscene material as a terminology, while other than that, the condition of minimal impairment should be met with other materials, which did not fall into the category. Accordingly, it can be stated that the infringement of a right, in this case, was justifiable, with the court ruling an objective decision.\n\nIt can be concluded from the four cases, that the standards of justification of an infringement are high to be easily met. In that sense, it can be stated that section one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is mainly used to protect the rights, rather than justifying their infringements. The cases in which the infringement of the government was justified turned into landmark cases such as the case R. v. Butler (1992). In the majority of cases, the Charter served its purpose perfectly, providing a guarantee of protection of rights and freedoms.\n\nClass Action Lawsuit\n\nOutlining the purposes of the class actions lawsuits, it can be stated that the rise of such phenomenon put the question of their practices and outcomes in a perspective that complicates the process of their differentiation. In that regard, it is stated that class actions lawsuits involving small-dollar claims “pose multiple dilemmas for public policy” (Hensler and Institute for Civil Justice (U.S.) 119). One such dilemma is that with the rise of such cases and the corresponding rise of the number of compensations, resulted in a shift from a useful social purpose of the lawsuits toward opportunity gains from the financial incentives through these cases. In that regard, this paper briefly analyses the type of class action lawsuit, and its inclination toward public policy or financial gains, based on the Ticketmaster class action lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit is based on the allegations that Ticketmaster, a ticket sale and distribution company, was redirecting their customer to subsidiary brokers, which were charging higher prices on ticket sales (FindLaw). People with the same kind of damages might be able to join the suit, provided they fulfilled several conditions related to the date of their visit to the website service and the date of the purchase. It can be seen that such lawsuits can be classified as cases that arise as individual litigation, and are later aggregated. These cases can be seen as damage class actions and are epitomized by mass personal injury and property damage suits (Hensler and Institute for Civil Justice (U.S.) 67).\n\nIn that regard, such cases are mainly concerned with possible gains, with little emphasis on regulations. Drawing a parallel to Ticketmaster, the consequences might lead to compensating the charges of the customers, with no regulatory effect or framework for the regulation of online transactions by private companies. This can be also caused by the fact that the damage itself is based only on one dimension, which is the financial dimension. The scale of the case might have increased due to the enormous population of online consumers. Additionally, it is stated that to influence public policies, the best solution is to draw two systems of enforcement, the administrative law, and private class actions. Thus, in the Ticketmaster case, for regulation to take place, an administrative lawsuit should be filed in parallel.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982”. 2009.

      "Billie Eilish’s Concert: Review Report\n\nIn the current report, I will be focusing on Billie Eilish’s concert that I attended on September 15, 2019, at 7 pm. The performance took place at Music Midtown Festival in Atlanta. Billie Eilish is an indie-pop singer and songwriter. At the concert, she performed her songs written together with her brother (a musician) Finneas O’Connell, who was a part of the show.\n\nIn this paragraph, I will be looking into details of Billie’s performance: her voice, instruments, dynamics, and tempo. Billie Eilish has a very memorable soprano voice that sounds somewhat intimate, quiet, dreamy and mysterious. In addition, her voice’s dynamics vary significantly: it goes from monotonous, slow sound to dramatic and passionate. Her tempo ranges over Largo, Adagio, Allegro and Presto. Despite the fact, that her vocal is generally characterized as deep, slow, whispery and emotional, her songs are engaging and rhythmic. It could be felt, but also seen at the concert, as everyone was dancing following the sound and rhythm of the music. The music texture consists mostly of homophony. Another important part of her show is an astonishing harmony in which all the controversial details exist. On the one hand, her monotonous voice and her calm facial expression, and, on the other hand, her crazy dancing performance and weird clothing. Additionally, it is a remarkable fact that Billie Eilish has no backup dancers on the show. She dances on her own during the concert, and she can keep people’s attention. Speaking of the musical instruments that were employed, there are piano, guitar and drums.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to mention that the atmosphere of the show evoked almost all positive emotions. The coherence between the various components (dynamic, tempo and instruments) made the show of exceptionally high quality.\n",
      "Gross Domestic Product, First Quarter 2020 Essay\n\nDespite some fluctuations, from 2016 until the first quarter of 2020, real GDP was positive. The sharp decline in early 2020 was probably due to the global pandemic, which disrupted the export and import network and significantly reduced citizens’ consumer opportunities. However, the situation should not be expected to improve by the second quarter. Swagel believes that real GDP will decline by 12 percent between April and June 2020, which will be an even more severe decline (Swagel). Moreover, the author believes that the unemployment rate will approach 14%, while the federal budget deficit will be at $3.7 trillion. It should be predicted that when the situation with coronavirus infections begins to disappear, GDP will recover gently and slowly to positive values. At the same time, it is essential to assume that growth will not be significant and rapid, as the data show that positive quarterly GDP fluctuations rarely exceed two percent.\n\nThe main reason for the initial decline and then a gradual recovery by several points is the global situation concerning the pandemic. It is known that two levels, microeconomic and macroeconomic, justify GDP growth. From a microeconomic perspective, GDP growth is associated with increased consumer spending on goods and increased employment. Macroeconomic factors usually include a general increase in investment in business and housing construction, growth in exports, and an increase in federal spending. In practice, the situation in the first quarter of 2020 is the opposite — due to the pandemic, a large number of citizens were quarantined and unemployed (Makridis and Hartley 1). This has created a chain of interrelated events that have affected both the fall in exports and the rise in unemployment and impoverishment. As a result, this situation caused a severe drop in GDP. The situation is expected to improve over time, and by the second half of 2020, according to Swagel, GDP will start to grow positively. This is due to the recovery of damaged economic chains, the return of people to work, and increased exports of goods and services.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAversa, Jeannine.

      "The Value of Children’s Playing Essay\n\nThe play is a concept that is inextricably linked with childhood. Although there are many games designed for adults in the modern world, playing is the most important for children. They learn about the world around them through the game, acquire new skills and knowledge. The purpose of the essay is to assess the value of children’s play, as well as to consider all aspects of this phenomenon.\n\nLearning About the World Through Play\n\nThe desire to play is inherent in every child without exception. Through the game, a person learns the world around him. This knowledge consists of the constant formulation and search for answers to two essential questions: “what is it” and “how does it work.” By playing, children learn about their abilities, develop both physically and mentally. Physical games teach a child to control movements and improve coordination. Cognitive activities give a person information about the materials from which objects are made. Finally, creative games allow developing one’s imagination, apply the acquired knowledge in practice.\n\nAt the same time, activities must meet and support the interests of children following their capabilities. The process of the game maintains the child’s morale and gives a sense of self-confidence. In other words, the concept of inclusiveness must be implemented in the creation and provision of games. It is necessary to create multiple options that ensure the availability of various and worthy alternatives. However, no child should be excluded from the game because of gender, race, or other things. This rule is enshrined in documents such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Early years foundation stage statutory framework for the UK.\n\nChildren’s rights\n\nAs mentioned above, children’s rights are cherished in such global organizational structures as the United Nations. This organization has a separate convention that protects the interests of minors. Following the text of this document, interests concerning the games are protected by article 31. According to it, children have the right to play and rest, engage in activities appropriate to their age, and freely participate in the cultural life of society. Each state that follows this agreement undertakes to help them participate in various events, providing everyone with equal opportunities. Despite the indicated obligations, unfortunately, they are far from always fulfilled. There are many cases where access to certain activities was restricted by gender or religion. There are also families that, due to their poverty, cannot provide their children with cultural participation, but the state does not help such people in any way. Thus, although these rights exist on paper, it is necessary to work on their full observance in real life.\n\nParticular attention must be paid to the timely satisfaction of the needs of the minors, as preferences change during growing up. Each child’s age has its games and its characteristics in interaction with the outside world. For example, during the first months of life, the child’s activity is often limited to interacting with parents, getting used to them. In this period, games are the study of objects that can be held in hands and put into the mouth. At this stage of development, it is necessary to have many bright-coloured objects that can be safely studied by pushing and grabbing. Children of ages from 1 to 3 begin to use their imagination, so it is essential to turn to activities that allow creating something. With further growth, the aspect of fantasy becomes increasingly critical. At the same time, the child shows more physical activity, actively exploring the world and nature. Therefore, it is vital to create safe places where children could complete their interests without harming themselves and open access to creativity so that they may develop their inner world.\n",
      "“Fire and Ice” by Robert Frost: Devastating Struggle of Human Emotions Essay\n\nFire and Ice (1920) is one of Robert Frost’s best-known poems. It metaphorically represents relationships between people, the struggle between the two extremums of human emotions, and its ability to bring the end of the world. The poem meticulously combines formal conciseness and conceptual depth. Thus, Fire and Ice is a remarkable example of the author’s skill to render a profound meaning using a minimum amount of linguistic tools.\n\nThe poem is composed of a nine-line stanza with irregular meter and rhyme pattern. The first two lines immediately establish a conflict between fire and ice as two extreme poles of the author’s worldview. Each of these elements is capable of bringing the world to an end: “Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice” (Frost 197). The narrator emphasizes the fundamental opposition between fire and ice through the use of anaphora, that is, the repetition of the phrase “Some say” at the beginning of each of two lines (Frost 197). This conceptual juxtaposition imposes the tone for the rest of the poem and has a decisive role in its metric framework.\n\nIn lines 3 and 4, the narrator compares fire to a human passion towards someone or something. The author suggests that one’s strong desires can have a destructive capacity. However, the speaker further introduces another powerful agent. In the last three lines, ice represents human hatred and cruelty. Indeed, cold reasoning also may be a disruptive force with similarly devastating outcomes for the world. Hence, the poem relies on the stylistic device of personification, which implies the endowment of inanimate objects with human traits. In such a way, Fire and Ice provides a vivid and compelling representation of abstract notions.\n\nIt is also necessary to observe that the poem’s tone is seemingly casual and relaxed. However, it discusses the serious and fundamental issues of human relationships and world order. This intention is evident in lines 5 and 6: “But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate” (Frost 197). The narrator hints that the world’s demise is inevitable, that he is ready to face it more than once. The speaker also declares that he has already experienced the ugly side of human nature. In such a manner, the poem ensures a more profound effect on its audience. The author deliberately applies a careless tone to attract the reader’s attention to this discrepancy between the form and the content.\n\nFurthermore, the line breaks in Fire and Ice are not accidental and convey a deep meaning. As one can easily observe, the break between the first two lines demonstrates the irreconcilable antagonism between fire and ice. Indeed, these two forces cannot exist within a single space, eventually breaking the poem into pieces. This graphic rupture symbolizes the world’s breakdown as a result of the devastating struggle of human emotions.\n\nThe line breaks are also significant for the poem’s conclusion. The last two lines are the shortest ones, consisting only of three words each. This splintered architecture provides the extreme conciseness of the poem’s ending and demonstrates the speaker’s pessimistic prognosis. In other words, the last lines symbolically depict the end of the world, where everything perishes in the struggle of human ambition and hatred.\n\nThus, Robert Frost’s poem vividly represents human relationships and their destructive potential. The central images of fire and ice symbolize the powerful emotions of passion and hate, and the speaker emphasizes that both of them are equally dangerous and disruptive for the world around us. The narrator admonishes thoughtless obedience to one’s inherent ambitions and aspirations, since it may have tragic consequences for humanity. The formal elements in Fire and Ice effectively contribute to rendering the profound and symbolic meaning of the poem. Hence, the surface means effectively working in tandem with its thoughtful content and ensuring the author’s strong message to the audience.\n\nWork Cited\n\nFrost, Robert.

      "Harvard Business: Digital Project Simulations Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nProject implementation is often characterised by several challenges that cause delays in the realisation of set timelines and cost overruns. Kaulio (2018) says the lack of proper collaboration among stakeholders and resistance to change are leading causes of these adverse outcomes. Consequently, it is important to manage project variables to ensure desired objectives are achieved. However, it is difficult to carry out this task theoretically because of the difficulty in accounting for all variables that affect a project. Carter (2019) refers to this challenge as the “black box” of project management because of the struggle to predict the effects of all variables in project management. However, the Harvard digital project simulation offered a unique opportunity to understand barriers to project implementation and self-assess to complete project tasks.\n\nPrototyping project activities in the simulation plan stood out for me because of its close semblance to the real-world work environment. Relative to this statement, Law (2019) says this type of simulation is useful in implementing project plans. Indeed, the simulation felt as if it was real, to the extent that I drew several similarities between online and offline project experiences. Consequently, the exercise made it easier for me to identify project challenges and address them effectively.\n\nHuemann, Ringhofer and Keegan (2019) suggest that this kind of exposure could lead to the development of project careers because multiple simulations exposes a person to several work-based experiences that improve the proficiency of managing implementation issues. Key concerns that emerged in the simulation focused on human resource issues, changes in project schedules and cost overruns. They are discussed below.\n\nKey Project Issues in Different Scenarios\n\nProjects are often characterised by several challenges. However, each one of them is unique to a particular case or context of implementation. To this extent of analysis, the digital simulation program helped me to identify three key challenges in project management that affect the overall process: human resource challenges, project costing and scheduling.\n\nHuman Resource Challenges\n\nIn week 1 of scenario A, there were no coaching or stand-up sessions, but week two accommodated one stand-up session. In the fourth week, there were three coaching sessions, while week 6 had one stand-up session. I gradually stopped stand-up and coaching sessions by the end of the project because I believed the team members had understood their tasks. This strategy aligns with the recommendations of Law (2019), Nijhuis, Vrijhoef and Kessels, (2018), which highlight the importance of educating team members about the complexity of projects. To do so, I selected partners who had a medium skill level and did not support an outsourcing strategy. The target date for completing the project was consistent throughout the period under analysis (200/200). However, team members had a moderate level of stress, which affected their morale.\n\nIn scenario B, management expected to launch a new printer before the competitors. In week 1, I started work on the project with a team size of three people who worked until week 6, when I was left with one person. However, I revisited this decision in week 9 after and increased the team size to four people. The high-speed target scope of the project and the need to obtain quality input, as proposed by Alami, Bouksour and Beidouri (2015), justified this decision. Two coaching sessions were completed in week 4 but the sessions increased to four after the expansion of team size and number of tasks completed per person (3.17). Collectively, in scenario B, I encountered several human resource management issues, which led to a typical level of stress among team members.\n\nIn scenario C, outsourcing was extensive and team skills were medium. During the first and second weeks of operation, there was no coaching or stand-up sessions offered but upon realising the team was not ready to undertake additional tasks, I offered three coaching sessions from the third week until completion of the project. Team stress levels were typical but morale levels were relatively high (89/100).\n\nI encountered similar human resource challenges in scenario D, which led to severe stress among team members and low morale. Comparatively, in week 1 of scenario D, I had no coaching or stand-up sessions. However, after the second week, I increased the number of coaching activities to four per week. Gradually, from the 12 th to 15 th week, I also reduced the number of coaching sessions to “0” and increased the team size from four to five during the 9 th to 15 th week to make up for human resource gaps.\n\nIn scenario E, I participated in four coaching sessions within the first and last three weeks to acquaint new employees with the requisite skills needed in project management and to improve product development processes. Although team members were relatively stressed, they had high morale. With a team size of three people and medium-high skill level, outsourcing was extensively practised throughout all stages of project execution.\n\nLastly, in scenario F, the team size comprised of four people with high levels of skills, while the outsourcing rating was extensive. Team members disagreed on the justification for assigning resources to the adoption of new and untested technology on the printer. Furthermore, other departmental heads were resource-starved. Therefore, it was imperative to show the merits of the chosen decision. Nevertheless, I developed a happy team that had high morale. Furthermore, I minimised the potential for human resource problems occurring by maintaining project schedules. Therefore, none of the employees left because I completed the project with the same number of people as I started with.\n\nThe team had a manageable workload because each member completed 0.7 tasks. Each one of them also worked for about 44 hours per week. No problems emerged in the course of the project development process and the weekly cost was $4,725. Comparatively, the team process rating was 78/100, meaning that there were some team-building issues. Coupled with a high level of stress, the team also exhibited low levels of morale, which Rispens, Jehn and Steinel (2020) attribute to weak management styles.\n\nProject Costs\n\nIn scenario A, I completed the wireless product meeting, as set out by the management and got a score of 200/200. After completing the task in week 18, I reduced the team size to three people to keep project costs low. The reduction in team size happened after week 6. However, this strategy failed to work because project costs increased to $59,000 against management’s target of $42,500. Consequently, as highlighted in figure 1 below, the project was over budget and behind schedule.\n\nFigure 1. Scenario A (Source: Developed by Author).\n\nIn scenario C, I completed the project after suffering a cost overrun because I incurred $54,338 in project overheads against the management’s target of $40,700. There was a similar cost overrun in scenario D because the total cost for the project was $53,275 while the management’s target was $40,000. The same situation replicated itself in scenario E where the targeted amount of $40,000 was surpassed because the total cost incurred was $51,975.\n\nIn this case, the product launch was over-budget and behind schedule. However, from the 12th week of scenario F, I met management’s targets and completed the project under budget. The multifunction product meeting was also undertaken according to management’s expectations with a project scope rating of 300/300. This score means that I surpassed expectations and that the results were consistent throughout the project. Thereafter, I successfully minimised project costs because the total overhead was $57,015, while management had set a target of $57,500. In this regard, I exceeded the goal by 1/200, as reported in the project resource rating score.\n\nScheduling\n\nIn two scenarios, management reduced the schedule for completing the project, thereby creating an urgent need to revamp manufacturing and marketing activities to pre-empt a similar product announcement by the competitor. Due to this change, I was unable to meet the deadline for the completion of the high-speed product launch because I delivered it in week 18 and opposed to week 17, which was the management’s target. Figure 2 below highlights the impact of this problem on the project’s cost structure and schedule.\n\nFigure 2. Scenario B (Source: Developed by Author).\n\nIn the first week of scenario C, I started the project with a team size of three people. I increased it to four during week six and later to five on the 7 th week because management reduced the project timeline, as it aimed to outdo the competition. Gnyawali and Charleton (2018) refer to this strategy as a hallmark of innovation when rivals try to outdo one another through technological developments. Nonetheless, the changes made by management to the project schedule were responsible for the delayed delivery of the product in scenario C because It was availed in week 17, while management expected this to happen on the 12 th week (project schedule rating – 214/250).\n\nIn scenario D, I was supposed to deliver the project on the 15 th week, but, as highlighted in figure 3 below, I was behind schedule as it was submitted on the 15 th week. In the first week of scenario E, I started the project with a team of three people. However, because of limited and scheduled timelines, I expanded the team to four people.\n\nFigure 3. Scenario D (Source: Developed by Author).\n\nIn scenario E, I completed the multifunctional product expectations, as stipulated by management (300/300), but the delivery of the product was behind schedule because it was supposed to be delivered on week 12 but I did so on week 15 (118/125). With a team size of four people who have extensive outsourcing capabilities in scenario F, I hosted stand up meetings every fortnight within six weeks. My goal was to complete the task ahead of schedule but this was not possible as I was behind schedule.\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nParticipating in the project simulation exercise was enlightening because I determined project outcomes without necessarily taking part in the real-world implementation of the project plan. Particularly, the ability to vary environmental conditions and investigate project outcomes through the digital simulation emerged as one of the key benefits of the learning process because I could determine the impact of variations of internal and external inputs on project outcomes. I conducted this analysis in terms of the number of employees and training opportunities provided through coaching and stand-up exercises.\n\nParticularly, human resource challenges emerged as top reasons for missed deadlines and budget overruns across the multiple scenarios analysed. This observation is in line with the findings of Claus (2019) and Akkermans et al. (2020), which mention the potential impact of human resource challenges on project outcomes.\n\nLastly, the ability to slow down the simulation process and study the outcomes more keenly was a unique feature I found appealing to the simulation process. However, as has been demonstrated through cost structure analysis, it was difficult to account for the financial impact of all variables on project outcomes. This is why most of the scenarios analysed were characterised by cost overruns. Consequently, a comprehensive simulation process should happen when project leaders have a proper understanding of what is needed to implement independent tasks and are aware of all factors pertinent to the process. The failure to account for these variables would lead to project failures and missed deadlines and milestones.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe project management exercise highlighted in this study helped in explaining the effects of multiple variables on project management outcomes in a controlled setting. The exercise is useful in designing future project management plans because some of the most pressing challenges are already highlighted in this paper. Therefore, better plans can be made. Furthermore, through this simulated experience, I can also determine the correctness and efficiency of a project model without operationalizing it. Overall, the simulated experience was eye opening because of its potential to improve managerial competencies in project management.\n\nReference List\n\nAkkermans, J. et al.

      "The Scientific Revolution as the Greatest Achievements by the Humanity Essay\n\nThe Scientific Revolution can be enumerated among the greatest achievements by the humanity during the whole course of the history. It changed the whole perception of the world around us, and established new tendencies in social, economical and political developments. The period of the Scientific Revolution became the time when science became more significant in people’s life that religion which was never possible before. Such considerable change led to the new way of thinking spread among people including atheism and pursuing materialistic values rather than spiritual ones. Overall, evaluating the situation it should be stated that the Scientific Revolution helped humanity achieve incredible progress in different areas including biology, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and chemistry which made it possible for people to break free form the chains that the Church put on them.\n\nFirst, speaking about the Scientific Revolution, it is important to give a definition to this important development in human life. The Scientific Revolution can be explained as a historic phenomenon which occurred between The Enlightenment and the beginning of industrialization in the end of the eighteenth century. The main characteristic of this period is unprecedented development in the area of science including such branches of science as biology, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.\n\nAmong the key figures of the Scientific Revolution were Nicolaus Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Giordano Bruno, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, and Francis Bacon. Nicolaus Copernicus was a great mathematician whose counting enabled him to acquire the true understanding on the world’s organization. He realized that the Earth is not the center of the Universe or the space as it was stated by the Catholic Church. This important finding became central in changing people’s understanding of the world around them. According to Tarnas (248), ‘more than any other single factor, it was the Copernican insight that provoked and symbolized the drastic, fundamnetal break from the ancient and medieval universe to that of the modern era’. Copernicus’ work was continued by the efforts of Galileo Galilei who was not afraid to die for his scientific findings and the triumph of truth. Galileo Galilei realized that the Earth was not a flat and motionless platform put on some visible pillars as it was taught by the Catholic Church. ‘With Galileo telescope, the heliocentric theory could no longer be considered merely a computational convenience’ (Tarnas 259). This ingenious finding became the reason of putting him to the list of heretics by the Church, and public execution by being burnt alive. Giordano Bruno had a similar lot in life: he ‘was burnt at the stake in 1600’ (Tarnas 253). The revelations of similar importance were offered to humanity by Isaac Newton, René Descartes, and Francis Bacon whose names will have eternal glory through generations as ‘the birth of modern era’ was able due to their efforts (Tarnas 271).\n\nThe reaction of the Church to the development of science was more than outrageous. ‘With religion and science in such apparent contradiction…- there was little question for Church authorities as to which system would prevail’ (Tarnas 254). Being worried for the areas of its influence among the population, the clergy was determined to destroy any person able to threat its exalted position. The Church made mind-blowing profits by means of keeping people in the darkness and ignorance. The Church developed many ways of robbing people such as indulgences, taxes, and “free-will” donations. It was absolutely clear for the clergy that with the development of science, people would realize how cruelly they were deceived, and the robbery would end up. On this reason, the Church was desperate in murdering every individual threatening its position in the society. As a result, thousands of innocent people were martyrly executed by the clergy. Still, this did not stop people of free will and honest heart who dreamt about helping humanity to go out of extreme darkness of false religious teachings and aberrations.\n\nThe fate of religion in light of the Scientific Revolution was predestined. People learnt how cruelly and unshamed they were deceived by the “holy” people speaking as if they were god’s servants. In reality, the representatives of Church appeared to be liars and wheeler-dealers. The Scientific Revolution became a reason why so many people forgot about their faith in god, and became atheists fiercely fighting with the Church and its deceitful practices. After the Scientific Revolution, religion was never able to occupy such central place in human society as it had before. The era of the Scientific Revolution even caused formation of atheistic states in the centuries to come. In these atheistic states occupying significant areas, the very idea of faith in god was unthinkable. Similarly to the previous activities of the Church, the leaders of those states relentlessly killed every person claiming to be in connection with religion.\n\nConcluding on the above-discussed information, it should be stated that the Scientific Revolution became a turning point in the history of humanity. With the development of such important sciences as biology, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and chemistry, the whole perception of the world has changed. Due to the findings of such ingenious men of science as Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, and Francis Bacon, people realized that they were long fooled and robbed by the Church. This became the beginning of the era of atheism in the human history.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nTarnas, Richard.

Reason for choosing the industry\n 5. Opportunities present and opportunities to be exploited\n 6. The market in the selected field and the competitive advantage\n 7. How my background will be supportive of same\n\nAbstract\n\nLeadership is the act of taking a role in offering instructions and making sure that the group follows the set rules and regulations. Rules and regulations usually offer a sense of cooperation to a group of people who have come together to pursue a common goal. In education, there are two groups of people, namely, teachers and students. The goals of the teacher are to instill knowledge to the students as required by the laws governing education. On the other hand, students’ goal at school is to be impacted with knowledge that will help them pursue different fields of professionalism in the future. To attain these goals, leadership becomes important to both groups. In this study, we will investigate the importance of leadership in the teaching staff.\n\nLeadership in the teaching staff\n\nLeadership is important in learning as it gives direction towards the attainment of a specific goal. In capstone entrepreneurial leadership, heads of the teaching staff become important in the management of both the human resource and the finances of the institution. The management of these resources ensures that the staff covers their work on time and the resources set for a certain period are well used.\n\nVision of leadership in the teaching staff\n\nThe capstone entrepreneurial leadership has various departments dedicated to the institution. Teaching staff falls under a very important department in the institution. Our vision as a teaching staff is to offer quality education to our students via quality management of the available resources. We are also focused on encouraging students’ integration without considering their race, ethnicity, and family background, among other factors. The enhanced integration is important to our students who are pursuing various courses and planning to work from any country around the globe. The institution’s vision is, therefore, to offer important skills the molds the student wholesomely. Our practice, as guided by the vision, has enabled us to be the first choice as a student destination center that offers not only quality education but also important social skills.\n\nReason for choosing the industry\n\nThe teaching industry is a global firm. Every country in the world has an education system that the citizens follow. The education system enhances the production of a skilled workforce whose mission is to improve the quality of the home economy. When a country is endowed with a skilled workforce, industries with the nation can work efficiently as innovation and inventions will be vibrant. Secondly, the excess labor force is also offered to other countries whose education is not developed. The offered workforce acts as an export program that accrues foreign revenues, thereby enhancing a country’s balance of trade. Focusing on the capstone teaching staff, we know the purpose of quality skills in our economy, and therefore we recruit a highly qualified teaching staff. We do not only recruit staff from our nation, but we pick the best from around the world. Our culture of recruitment has become a mirror image of our students who are enrolling from around the globe. Our practice in quality leadership is important to our students who will head different corporates around the world. Therefore, the topic of leadership in the teaching staff is meant to impact these values to our students who are indeed our future leaders.\n\nOpportunities present and opportunities to be exploited\n\nThe major benefit that we are enjoying is the high population of students who are flocking in the university to seek our services. The student population in our institution is directly proportional to the staffs’ income. The quality services have been the driving factor towards this opportunity. Regarding future benefits, we are considering devolving our services to the countries around the world. The benefit of this task will be to be near the students. The devolved institution will attract students who could otherwise have a problem in traveling abroad. The quality of our service will enhance our future income.\n\nThe market in the selected field and the competitive advantage\n\nThe market for the teaching staff is purely our students. We offer our skills to the students and they pay for the service. Our quality service has always been the attractive feature in the market. Our competitive advantage is the quality plus the low price involved in getting the services. We are focusing in offering research to various global organizations in the future. The service will be beneficial to us as we already have contact with most of the global organizations that are attracted to our present services.\n\nHow my background will be supportive of same\n\nI am a student and my background will be beneficial to the institution in the future. As a student, I am going to acquire some important managerial and marketing skills. I will utilize these skills in ensuring that the institution moves to some greater heights. I am looking forward to becoming a corner stone in the future running of the management’s offer.\n",
      "How Can Teacher Motivate Emirati Students to Read? Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Purpose and Methodology\n 3. Research Questions\n 4. Results\n 5. Analysis\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nMaking students read can sometimes turn into a tough challenge for many teachers epically if they work with representatives from Gulf countries. It appears that Emirati students are not introduced to the culture of reading in their free time or at home though the country has faced drastic changes and development over the last three decades. Education appeared to be a key element of those changes considering a vast representation of the UAE on the oil market and other defining industries branches. Language appears to be a new potential resource. It means that strategies of motivating students’ reading also call for changes and development.\n\nPurpose and Methodology\n\nThis study is to identify the most efficient motivating strategies for Emirati students. It investigates the literacy and enjoyment level of reading in English in addition to key components that motivate students to read books in their free time. The qualitative case study discusses several motivation types based on teachers and students’ interviews and detects the most important ones. The idea is to reveal possible aspects of effective literacy practices and implement motivating strategies in the classroom setting.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThis study contains answers to questions asked during interviews with instructors. These answers are used to synthesize and collect necessary data that will help to determine the main problems of students resistant to reading as well as the most efficient motivation strategies and tools. The research questions are as follows:\n\n 1. What proportion of your Emirati student enjoy reading in their free time? How does this compare with other nationalities that you have taught?\n 2. What motivates Emirati students to read books in their free time?\n 3. Why do other Emirati students not enjoy reading in their free time?\n 4. What strategies do you use to motivate Emirati students to read? Do you try to develop intrinsic or extrinsic motivation? Which is more important?\n 5. How can teachers blend student’s’ personal reading motivation in the classroom setting?\n\nResults\n\nThe term “motivation” can be defined as the extent to which we opt for particular goals and purposes and make efforts in order to achieve those goals. The deficit of reading has become more evident when the official 2012 IELTS score has been revealed with only 4.6 for UAE. Such score is the worst among all other Gulf countries putting Emirati students in a tight corner. On the one hand, some of them are resistant to reading in the classroom setting.\n\nThey have a clear understanding of their weakness in that field considering that “Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the official language of the country and of the public sector; English is the language of much of the private sector” (O’Neill, 2014). Moreover, the UAE can boast a unique educational system with about half Emirati nationals who go to private educational establishments. The current statistics shows that there are “87% of students in private schools” (Kenaid, 2011).\n\nThe score is rather low if compared with the average result 6.0 for other countries. Reading comprehension difficulties, Arabic speaking students face, mainly occur “due to deficient lower level processes such as letter and word identification” (O’Sullivan, n.d.). That is why new strategies and motivation tools should be implemented to improve the situation. Education field is improving in view of new technologies. Innovative methods appear making it possible for students from the UAE to benefit from efficient online motivation tools such as Mreader as a part of a university foundation system. Moreover, specific types of books have been determined.\n\nThey have proved to be more interesting for Emirati students considering their national preferences. This fact makes the reading easier and more involving which eventually results in a greater success. Most students are used to reading tasks where they need to concentrate on words rather than key ideas and thoughts. This strategy also calls for reframing to make the literacy practice more interesting.\n\nEmirati students’ interviews depict several key factors that motivate them to read books in their free time. Major respondents are eager to study at leading universities abroad. Such eagerness is often pushed by the will of their parents. Statistics shows that boys are pushed less in comparison with the girls considering cultural and social aspects of the UAE. Males are freer than females who are more responsible.\n\nMoreover, Emirati students show their readiness to discuss different topics in the classroom. They include non-academic topics related to society, ethics and more. They only need a close interaction with other participants while instructors are recommended accommodating personal needs of their students. Degree, interaction quality, and duration are among the key factors that influence the motivation to read and develop the level of literacy.\n\nOn the other hand, some Emirati students are resistant to reading books. It results in a simple boringness, which comes as a stereotype. Some students simply do not like it to visit libraries or prefer spending free time playing the computer or surfing the net via portable gadgets and laptops. Several efficient methods help to overcome those reasons. Teachers’ interviews highlight various key points that include personal motivation.\n\nInstructors are free to establish personal relations with individual participants. The idea is to express a sincere interest in every student in particular. Development of cultural awareness helps to motivate students to read in the classroom setting. Instructors should always have time to discuss students’ culture developing the in-depth understanding and acceptance. Some teachers opt for describing stereotypes from different cultures and proceed with cultural exchanges involving all participants in the educational process.\n\nThis study contains several key concepts based on “the two main types of learner motivation: extrinsic and intrinsic motivation” (Johnson, n.d.). Both types are necessary to develop. However, intrinsic type is more efficient according to the latest researches and interviews. Intrinsic motivation is when a student simply enjoys the activity he or she is engaged. No obvious external awards are necessary when using this type of motivation.\n\nIntrinsic motivation explains why people are involved in particular activities for pleasure and satisfaction. Still there is a type of extrinsic motivation that experienced instructors suggest developing. Some students require a boot and a sense of self-determination. This is why positive feedback is vital. The only thing teachers should keep in mind “every class is a mixed ability class, and, even with a new group, you know who the best students are” (Wilson, 2010).\n\nMotivation to read in the classroom setting includes several defining points highlighted by the interview. First of all, social connection between students in the classroom. It stimulates gender dynamics and results in an efficient and enjoyable work in pairs and groups. The information should be presented in various formats, not only in books. Aural culture and storytelling can also have a great impact on the overall literacy level.\n\nAnalysis\n\nTeachers are responsible for creating a students’-friendly atmosphere in the classroom. They are supposed to know much about Emirati culture as well as the linguistic background. It will help to determine the most efficient motivation strategy in future. Using students’ communication capacities is vital. On the one hand, it will result in literacy skills development. On the other hand, it will help to foster the harmony in the classroom and encourage students to achieve their future goals.\n\nReferences\n\nJohnson, A. (n.d.).

      "Gulf War Deterrence. The Most Viable Way of Dealing With Conflicts Coursework\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Deterrence as a Way to Keep the Conflict\n 2. The Prisoners’ Dilemma Theory\n 3. Bibliography\n 4. Footnotes\n\nDeterrence as a Way to Keep the Conflict\n\nDeterrence is defined as a threat given by one nation to take destructive actions towards another, in response to the latter’s potential or promised action, where the two nations are in a political rivalry. In simpler terms, it is the promised retaliatory actions that are more destructive than the initial actions. In this case therefore, both nations are expected to act as though they really mean to carry out the threats, making the other believe that their actions might harm them more owing to the planned retaliation 1 . This theory was used against the US states during its invasion in the gulf war, a step that was intended to make them withdraw their troupes from the region.\n\nIn international relations, deterrence is considered to be the most viable way of dealing with conflicts. The gulf war is believed to have come up as a result of deterrence whereby the US issued threats towards the Iraq government and vice versa 2 . Despite this, it is also true that some very destructive attacks were also hindered by the same. This is in the sense that as most people believe it prevented the then president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein from using nuclear weapons against the US. Most scholars perceive that he knew the US had the weapons and technology required to retaliate effectively.\n\nIn this sense, it can be argued that deterrence proved a viable tool and this is only so when one of the parties in conflict knows that retaliatory attacks from the other party can be fatal. Therefore this is only a special case, where deterrence is given credit. In other cases, it can lead to serious losses to both parties. This happens when none of the parties wants to be on the losing side. No one would ever want to be known for issuing empty threats and this explains why most countries have taken to war knowing very well that it will have adverse effects to the country 3 .\n\nThe Prisoners’ Dilemma Theory\n\nIn the discussion of deterrence, it is important to consider it in the light of the prisoners’ dilemma theory. This is a model that has two people caught in a crime together and being tried differently. If one of the prisoners confesses, he gets freedom and the other one gets heavy punishment. If they both confess, they both get heavy punishment, and so this is out of question. The other option is where both deny the crime and they get light punishment each. This scenario is likened to deterrence since in both cases; one does not know what the other party is thinking. One might decide to withdraw the threats but the opponent pushes on with the attack plans causing more losses to the other party.\n\nWhere deterrence is in place, both parties will definitely be afraid to act especially where they have no idea of the extent that the other party can go to protect itself and retaliate. From this therefore, a conclusion can be drawn that deterrence is a viable concept in international relations. It has its disadvantages but the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages. These threats have worked in some cases where the attackers are delayed by retaliatory threats. This delay allows the international community to come up with strategies of preventing the situation if possible, or how to handle the consequences should the attack take place. There are however few cases where deterrence has been fatal and a good example is the September 11 attack on the twin towers. Despite the losses, it also acted as a wakeup call all over the world such that threats thereafter were taken more seriously. Security measures were also beefed up all over the world especially in the entry and exit points 4 . Therefore, in as much as it caused a lot of losses in terms of lives and property, it also had positive impacts and after that deterrence was taken to be a viable concept.\n\nBibliography\n\nFisher, Uri. “Deterrence, Terrorism, and American Values .” Homeland security affairs (2007): 12 – 20.\n\nLawrence, Freedman, and Efraim Karsh.

      "Developing a Fictional Case Study Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nThe Palm Tree Resort and Casino is the largest resort in the state of California with its area of 188,000 sq ft and more than 3000 slot machines. The casino has gained large popularity and earns several million dollars every year; the part of the sum is spent on the local towns’ development. The number of employees of the Palm Tree Casino and Resort is up to 4,100 people of managers and personnel. Visitors have a wonderful chance to get rest and spend money at the slot machines on the gaming floor; there is a wonderful luxurious hotel that offers 522 rooms. There are more than 130 table games including famous Black Jack, Fortune Pai Gow Poker, and many more (Valley, 2003). It has golf courses, field trips, and spa salons to offer a high quality service compared to all other businesses like that within their industry.\n\nThe company’s mission is to grant joy and happiness to the clients who resort to casino entertainment. Also, one of the missions is to support the Indian reservation’s economic growth as it has been funded by the Indian reservations’ capitals initially. Giving job opportunities to the local towns, the Palm Tree Resort and Casino happens to implement a very serious and important role – a state economy supplier with its annual profit of more than 33 million dollars while being the largest casino and resort in Southern California.\n\nIn order to get a closer insight into the area of casino management structure and objectives, it was a great chance to talk to casino CFO – Chief Financial Officer Julie Wiseman (Weiswasser, 2011). She is likely to outline the objectives and the actual management structure of the hotel and casino service at her work place. It is a great opportunity to interview Mrs. Wiseman as any casino CEO would say that financial department is the most important in this business. Therefore, an interview with a casino veteran Mrs. Wiseman who happens to have worked in one of Las Vegas casinos, as well, should unveil the internal management structure together with organizational development issues. Meeting at casino’s conference room would be a splendid chance to ask the following questions.\n\nThe first question will logically be about the property of the Palm Tree Resort and Casino. The Vice President of Finance will tell about the size of the land property itself and the most important feature of all the casinos – the gaming floor. It is essential to bring up the information about the number of slot machines and the capacity of the hotel. The second question: “Tell me about the Organizational Structure of the Palm Tree Casino and Resort. It is very intersecting how you delegate the tasks and what responsibilities does every department head have?” This way the interviewer makes it clear what the chart of internal organization management is. Third question: “Can you describe your day or the work schedule? And if there are any CFO assistants before the actual executive employees”. The CFO is going to tell about financial director and financial controller and the order in which they report to the higher positioned posts. Forth question: “What are the priorities of the department and, please, tell me do you have any challenges?” And the last question: “What are the prospects of the company and where do you see the future taking your casino?”\n\nReferences\n\nValley, D.

      "Love in a Fallen City Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Plot summary\n 3. Discussion\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Work Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nLove in a fallen city is a novel whose main theme is the conflict that exists in love relationships. The author’s central concerns in this novel are the social factors that influence the quality of a relationship that develops in marriage. The author has used characters with differing perspectives to illustrate this conflict. Bai Liusu and Fan Liu Yuan are the major characters in this story whose love relationship started with conflict but later ended up in marriage. The author based the story in Hong Kong referring it to ‘a fallen city’ because it was not a favorable environment for love. The two main characters had different perspectives on love even though lastly married. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the strategies that the author uses to depict the characters. The author used specific themes to illustrate how the characters struggle to have a better future.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe story of Bai Liu Su and Fan Liu Yuan was based in Hong Kong. Bai Liu Su was a twenty-eight years old and divorced woman who lived in Shanghai. She faced a lot of criticism from relatives for living at home instead of living with a man. Bai’s relatives lived a traditional form of life whereby a woman would only earn respect if she lived with a man irrespective of whether the woman loved the man. As a result of this culture, Bai had to get a man to live with. On the other hand, Fan Liu Yuan had just arrived from England and had inherited wealth from his father. When in England, Fan realized that Chinese women were the best women to marry and therefore thought of Bai. Fan Liu Yuan loved this woman so much and therefore expected that Bai would also love him. Chang (p. 156) notes that “Fan had grown up in the foreign country and thought that real Chinese women were the most beautiful women in the world”. Therefore, when he came to Hong Kong, she called Bai to come to his place. When the two met, Bai insisted on marriage while Fan insisted that he just required Bai to love him deep from her heart. Due to these differing opinions, a conflict of interest resulted even though the two rely on needed each other. When Bai returned home, she expected that her people would not be happy if she was not able to win that man. Bai, therefore, had to do her best to marry this man so as she could earn respect from her people. For her plan to work, Chang (p. 174) notes that “to win other woman’s respects, she decided to go with Mrs.Xu to Hong Kong to see whether she could win the love of Fan”. They would therefore walk in the city together and could not even hold each other. Even though many pretty young girls liked Fan, he only loved Bai and especially because of her Chinese style. Eventually, they understood each other and got married and at the end of the novel, they lived happily.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe author used the conflict as a strategy to express how characters in the novel struggle to end up living a better life. First, the author portrayed the conflict between traditional marriage and the modern lifestyle. Bai Liu Su adopted the traditional lifestyle, whereby people believed that a respectable woman was the one who lived with a man. However, Fan Liu Yuan was a modern man who had even lived in a foreign country believed that; to live a comfortable life, he needed a woman to love him (Chang, p. 256). These different perspectives on life were responsible for the misunderstanding that existed between Bai and Fan. The author emphasized that; the couple suffered before it eventually settled on marriage. When they are finally married, Fan recalled how they suffered, Chang (p. 302) notes what he told his wife “we were too busy falling in love, how could we possibly find time to love”? According to the author, the conflict between the two characters was a result of the two being brought up in different settings.\n\nThe author also used determination as a strategy to depict the characters. The characters in this novel were very much willing to settle as married people. Determination calls for sacrifice and willingness to take any step to succeed. Bai Liu Su sacrificed her time to travel to Hong Kong whenever Fan Liu Yuan called her to an extent that she assumed that Fan was misusing her. On the other hand, Fan Liu Yuan did not have any interest in the young pretty girls of Hong Kong who loved him since his interest was in Bai. Chang (p. 295) supported this saying “although lots of pretty young girls liked him, he was attracted by Bai Liu Su as he saw the same flimsy, conflicted and lonely heart with him”. The author, therefore, implied that; none of the characters could change his/her minds before realizing his/her goals. Each of the character’s dreams was to live a life that was good irrespective of how such a life could be earned.\n\nThe author also portrayed the characters as being individualistic as a strategy to depict them. The two major characters could be termed as being individualistic since each of them decided to stick hard on his/her decision. Bai Liu Su insisted that she just wanted marriage from Fan Liu Yuan and nothing else. There is no one time that she agreed her decision to be influenced by her future husband. On the other hand, Fan Liu Yuan insisted that he wanted love from her future wife and therefore could not change his mind easily. This principle led the two characters to live in conflict before they settled for marriage. Chang (p. 305) notes that Fan Liu Yuan regretted his past and said to his wife that “If… you had known me before, then maybe you could give me for the way I am now”. If the two characters had a chance to listen to each other, they would have settled their differences easily through dialogue. However, each of the characters believed that the decision made was the right one and therefore decided to wait until the good day would come. The conflict between the two characters could be easily solved since the two characters were interested in each other for specific reasons and therefore they needed each other.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe author referred to the novel as ‘Love in Fallen City’ because of the way the love between the two main characters went along. Hong Kong city could also be referred to as a fallen city because it was not a good environment for lovers. Before the couple ended up in a marriage, the two used to meet in Hong Kong but nothing grew out of their meeting. There were times that the two characters would meet and they could not even touch each other.\n\nWork Cited\n\nChang, Eileen. Love in a Fallen City . New York: New York Review Books, 2007.\n",
      "Briere and Scott’s Principles of Trauma Therapy Report (Assessment)\n\nTrauma can be said to be experiences that happen above normal human occurrences. Trauma makes an individual to feel vulnerable, insecure, paralyzed, and even weak. It is an overwhelming feeling that has the power to control a person. People who are traumatized may not be able to think clearly and one center on oneself to try and come to terms with their condition they are going through. Trauma victims spend most of the time trying to figure how they would have done things differently. Some examples of traumatic events include rape, child abuse, fire, hurricanes as well as war (Briere, & Scott, 2006).\n\nJohn Briere and Catherine Scott mention various symptoms that patients of trauma may experience. Mood or even emotional disorders which can be caused by stressful events and causing the patient to feel a loss of security and vulnerable. Panic disorder, fear as well as generalized anxiety disorder where the patient is always worried that something terrible can happen anytime. Depression is another symptom of trauma and can be accompanied by psychosis where the patient is not able to associate with reality.\n\nPost- Traumatic stress disorder is another common symptom for victims of trauma. Here the patient has disturbing memories and thus one has to constantly keep trying to avoid such memories as well as having regular state of staying alert. This condition can keep the patient depressed at being unable to control their fear and anxiety (Briere, & Scott, 2006).\n\nOther common symptoms include dissociation where patients keep away from all disturbing situations that caused the trauma. This condition can sometimes lead to amnesia and the patient forgets everything. Tension reduction behaviors are also very common and bring about disturbing behaviors to the patient. These may include drug abuse and violence behaviors especially among the youth. Young girls may also engage in sexual activates trying to get security from their sexual partners. Emotional dysregulation is common and the patient experiences changes in their mood often and being irritable all the time. One may result in becoming very angry and hence destroy things and cursing all the time. These traumatic symptoms need special treatment to allow the individuals to have a managed and capable living (Briere, & Scott, 2006).\n\nBriere and Scott have suggested that therapist should use trauma evaluation methods like Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Second Edition (MMPI-2) and PAI Personal Assessment Inventory (PAI). The MMPI-2 and PAI evaluates extensive range of psychological problems like depression, panic disorders and traumatic stress disorders. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder scales are good in assessment of this disorder.\n\nThey are especially efficient in children and adolescents to determine how they have been traumatized by various events. They also recommend Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) in assessment of severe and chronic posttraumatic problems like rape, domestic violence as well as natural calamities. Various cases of child abuse as well as other early conditions of traumatic problems. Detailed Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress (DAPS) can be used to evaluate an adult history experience of traumatic events. This test can be able to evaluate the current psychological responses either emotional or cognitive in continuing posttraumatic problems (Briere, & Scott, 2006).\n\nBriere and Scott suggested various methods that therapists can use to treat trauma. The methods are for both current as well as persistent posttraumatic problems. Emotional processing is very necessary where the therapist centers on emotional conflicts that are as a result of traumatic exposure. The therapist should be calm to listen to the events thus giving the patient self-esteem. In this way, the patient will have the facility to manage powerful emotions and thus the therapist will help understand feelings of rejection and abreaction. Therapist should promote expression with the patient and at the same time offer psychoeducation. This will promote active relatedness between the therapist and the patient and therefore help the patient get in touch with one’s emotions (Briere, & Scott, 2006).\n\nCognitive behavior therapy is very necessary to assist the patient connect with reality especially with patients suffering from psychosis. Here exposure method is applied to quicken reassessment of cognitions. The therapist normalizes the situation the patient went through to help them connect with their feelings. When dealing with patients of torture the therapist should create and recreate a safe environment.\n\nThe cultural differences should be addressed and the therapist should be sensitive to the culture. Understanding the real situation of the patient is very important. The therapist should be able to help the patient connect with the traumatic events in order for the recovery process to be possible. The level of treatment should be given depending on the type of traumatic event the patient underwent or is undergoing (Briere, & Scott, 2006).\n\nConclusion\n\nBriere and Scott have done a wide range of research on stages of trauma. Much of their work is done based on the patient and type of work they have been engaged. Trauma is very common to many people and the necessary measures of evaluation ad treatment are necessary. Treatment of the patients depends on the type of traumatic exposure an individual experiences. Scott and Briere have been able to put down the whole process a systematic way in order to help trauma patients. Therapist should be able to follow the right treatment information and procedure in order to help their patients achieve full recovery (Briere, & Scott, 2006).\n\nReference:\n\nBriere, J., & Scott, C.

      "The DHL Strategies on Customer Attraction Term Paper\n\nDHL is a multinational company offering overseas transport to clients across the globe. The DHL; started by offering delivery services in one country, but at present, it serves more than two hundred and twenty regions including the Far East, Eastern Europe, and china. DHL is at present the global leading company in the industry of express and logistics services. The DHL provides innovative and customized transport solutions to its clients, from a single source. In 2003 the DHL expanded significantly after it merged with other shipping companies; Danzas and Deutsche post (Gregoty1984).\n\nTo rise to this position; DHL has employed several strategies which make it the leading company within the industry. The DHL provides door-to-door services thus expanding its imports. The door to door services are very beneficial to clients; since it is very convenient and reliable to the customers. With the use of one currency which is the US dollar; the company has been very convenient to its clients, thus making transactions easy. Their invoices are written using the values on us dollars thus very easy to transact. This strategy has made DHL clients very loyal to the company, thus making it to be the leading company in the market (Abate1993).\n\nThe operation of the DHL in nearly all corners of the globe makes it most preferred by customers; which is because the DHL serves more than 220 regions including the Far East, Eastern Europe, and china. This makes DHL be the most popular company in the market since its presence in most countries creates consumer awareness about its existence. By the fact that DHL operates in many countries; creates consumer confidence in that consumers will feel much convenient to transport goods using one company, then transporting goods with different companies on their way to their destination (Goodrich1955).\n\nThe DHL operates using one currency which is the US dollar; which helps to speed up transactions and reduce costs that may be incurred through currency conversion. This scenario is very advantageous to the clients; as it helps to build consumer trust and satisfaction. By the fact that less time is incurred in transactions and costs evaded through the use of one currency; makes the DHL offer the cheapest transport charges thus attracting more clients.\n\nFurther, the US dollar is accessible in nearly all nations thus making it the most convenient means of making payments. This is because; it lessens the consumers’ burden of looking for different currencies; which may cost a lot of time thus causing delays during transportation. Since consumers’ deadlines are met as planned, DHL is thus in a position of attracting and retaining its customers (Abate1993).\n\nThe application of modern technology in making transactions; which are supported by the use of information technology helps DHL to provide quality services to its clients. This can be justified by the fact that; orders are made online, thus not much time is wasted in traveling to the head offices thus attaining consumer satisfaction. Payments are also computerized and are made through the banks, which further saves the time used in making payments; which makes DHL one of the most efficient transport companies.\n\nThe DHL is also equipped with modern tracking tools, which helps to monitor cargo movement and thus help reduce delays and theft; thus optimizing consumer satisfaction. Consumers’ parcels and cargo are in this case much secure; thus the company does not face extra costs in compensating clients as a result of theft and fraud, which helps the DHL to maximize its profit (Gardner et al1992).\n\nDHL has also been able to win clients through its successful marketing strategies, which has made its operations to be known all over the globe. First and foremost the DHL has applied internet marketing by opening its website; which has helped boost sales and the reception of consumer views about the company’s operations. Email marketing has also helped DHL to build trust in its customers, from which the DHL is also able to get valuable information and also increase revenues. The DHL has also managed to conduct successful sales and marketing training, which has been achieved through watching marketing tapes and online marketing training among others. These marketing strategies have also enabled DHL to understand its clients and also act to the information received from them (Gardner et al1992).\n\nThe pricing strategy of DHL has been one of the best; where it has been able to meet the needs of the different clients across the globe thus building customer trust. To arrive at this pricing strategy the DHL has done an intense SWOT analysis; to come up with the most appropriate pricing strategy. Following the diversity of clients drawn from different nations; developed and developing countries, DHL has adjusted its prices to cater to the needs of all its clients. The DHL has been forced to balance between decentralized, centralized, and hybrid techniques of pricing. To increase revenue the DHL had to increase prices but this adversely affected the clients from poor states; thus the need to revise the prices. As result, this has led to the introduction of lower and flexible prices accompanied by discounts to cater to clients from poor states (Hocknell2001).\n\nAfter keenly following the operations of the DHL in all the regions of operation, it is clear to judge that its services are highly preferred by transportation clients. This preference is due to the good strategies applied by the management of DHL, which makes it very efficient and able to offer high-quality services at reasonable prices. In the case the management of DHL follows these strategies it will continue to be the market leader, and able to win customer trust thus rising even to higher levels.\n\nReferences list\n\nAbate, Z. 1993.

      "Broadcast on Television Analysis Essay\n\nMedia plays a key role in this aspect as its coverage spread includes millions of people who all are heavily reliant on the media in terms of providing them with the necessary know-how about what is happening within the nation and on an international level. Hence, it becomes a primary responsibility of these same news channels to ensure that the people have access to all the information possible.\n\nThe sort of media that would be analyzed by this essay would include broadcast media which includes all the communications delivered over mass electronic communications. Examples of such channels include BBC, CNN, Sky News, Fox News, etc. The sort of coverage that these channels have includes millions of viewers and hence, the power which can be exercised by these channels is immense.\n\nMost of the viewers are heavily reliant on these news items and therefore, these news channels must remain committed to the task of ensuring that the news items being broadcasted are in the truest sense showcasing the appropriate information to the viewers.\n\nIn recent years, there have been times when the news items have been used to attract the viewers or even improve the ratings but at the cost of broadcasting information which might be considered to be not as important as the sort of coverage being given to it.\n\nThe idea of trying to attract readers by giving more coverage to items that are more attractive or more awe-inspiring has resulted in some of the important news items being relegated to lesser important sections. The difference can be established between these items when one item concerns the activities of certain influential people such as the celebrity stars, players, etc who might be great for the sake of boosting the ratings but what has to be understood at the same time is that that has resulted in the information dissemination process having been effected in a negative sense.\n\nThis essay would seek to examine the differences that exist between those items that focus on the relatively important issues as compared to others and others that focus on gossip and sensationalism.\n\nThe fact remains that the news channels need to be directed in a manner that would allow them to ensure that the sort of information being broadcasted is according to the needs and requirements of the people and the world in general.\n\nThe world does need to be informed about the way the conflicts are taking place and the activities of the non-state actors in Pakistan which are affecting the security of millions. What the world does not need to be informed through these international channels is how many children do Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have and the new region from which they would be adopting another child.\n\nThe clear distinction above the two news items can mean a world of difference in terms of the world becoming more aware of the security threats that exist. The Gaza conflict was not given appropriate coverage which effectively meant that the people of Gaza were not given the sort of aid they required. That resulted in many people having to face homelessness and other issues alike and the ignorance of the world was witnessed when the level of aid proved to be insufficient.\n\nThe sort of coverage that was given to the Oscars might have been much more than necessary as there are several issues in which the world needs to be informed. This essay is not in any way attempting to belittle the importance of entertainment or any activities attached to entertainment. What this essay is seeking to do is enhance the role of the news channels as information providers. The news needs to focus on economic issues, political items, social issues which are many.\n\nThe recent example of the attention given to the sort of clothes worn by Michelle Obama was another example of the different ways that these newspaper channels seek to attract viewers. More focus was given to the first lady’s clothing than was given to the Vice-President on the day Barack Obama was elected President.\n\nThis is a case of an attempt to gather the interest of the younger generation and the fashion-driven people who would given priority to such things. However, when such news becomes international news then that is a pure waste of time and effort especially in the case of the news channels.\n\nThe world at the time was seeking to gain maximum awareness regarding the policies and the cabinet selections of the elected President rather than what the First Lady was wearing to the evening ball.\n\nWith time, these sorts of activities to attract the viewers have shown an increasing trend which highlights the sense of competition which has risen amongst these channels to attract more and more viewers. The situation in certain sub-Sahara areas in Africa is quite deplorable but the sort of media attention that has been given to it is even more deplorable.\n\nThese news items can have a huge influence on safeguarding the rights of millions and though the news items regarding the Grammy and Oscars might certainly be beneficial to the viewers, the greater interests at large have to be considered.\n\nThe basic purpose of these news channels would have to be considered in such a situation. Do they merely play the role of highlighting the wardrobe of certain influential people, their lifestyles, or have they come into existence to make the people aware of the actual issues affecting them?\n\nThe answer to this can have huge repercussions as the more aware are the people, the more are people benefitting from this knowledge. The issues which have been at a stagnant point can be addressed properly, as is in the case of the fight between the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan government.\n\nThis terrorist organization has been funded by several organizations which have done so since the world has not given its proper attention. These critical issues of examined can effectively erode the funding of such organizations.\n\nAs long as the news channels remain committed to proper dissemination and distribution of information, they can reap huge benefits for all. The attacks which take place in countries like India, Pakistan need to be given greater coverage to highlight the plight of these national governments so that they can seek the sort of help and foreign assistance that they require. Noting can be gained from ignorance and the projection of sensationalist stories except leaving hapless states to the state they are in.\n\nThe news channels need to review the sort of news that they are broadcasting as the world needs to be made aware of the issues that affect it.\n",
      "Importance to Reason and Logic Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Main body\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Bibliography\n\nIntroduction\n\nPrior to evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of reason as a way of knowing, we should first discuss such concept as knowledge, because even now philosophers and scholars have not come to the agreement as to this issue. Overall, it can be defined as image or perception of reality, which is subjective in its very core. The question arises how a human being can acquire these experiences and whether they are always valid. Certainly, reason is primarily based on the information, which we obtain by means of our senses, such as vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch. However, it should be taken into consideration that our senses are often inclined to deceive us. Psychologists argue that every person, irrespective of his or her mental faculties, may fall victim to illusion, which means that logic and reason may sometimes rely on distorted data or facts about reality. It does not mean that he or she may suffer from some mental disorder even a sane person is liable to illusion and there are certain mechanisms, which produce such an effect. Although, it is argued that reason operates only with evidence-based facts, these postulates are derived from our senses thus, rationalism may is prone to error as well. Rational way of thinking and knowing can be successful only under the condition that a human being completely rejects the idea of unquestionable or absolute truth.\n\nMain body\n\nPhilosophers have always attempted to find a way of knowing the truth. Among them, we can mark out the famous French mathematician and thinker Rennes Descartes. He attached primary importance to reason or logic as a way of knowing. In his work “Discourse on the Method”, he formulated the major principles of rationalism. According to Descartes, a person should always “avoid hasty judgment and prejudice” (Descartes, 11). In this respect, it is quite possible for us to say that, such approach is by far the most important feature of rationalism. The famous philosopher believes that a human being must never accept anything for granted, unless, he or she knows it to be true. Probably, this is the major strength of reason as a way of knowing because it eliminates bias, prejudice.\n\nFurthermore, we may speak about the so-called “subliminal persuasion”, which means that a human being has a predefined image of reality, in other words, we usually see only what we expect to see. As a rule, people try to adapt facts to their theories, and it contradicts scientific principles. Reason rejects such doctrine, ideas, expressed by Rene Descartes radically changed main scientific methods of collecting and analyzing data, especially, if we are speaking about mathematics and natural science. Yet, it may not be always applicable for arts, because they appeal mostly to our emotions, and they are not a subject to rational analysis. Apart, from that mathematics or natural sciences usually give room only for one correct answer or interpretation, whereas human sciences allow multiple interpretations, even the most questionable argument cannot be fully refuted or overlooked.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, people base their judgment or beliefs on stereotypes, deeply rooted in their consciousness; moreover, they do not even intend to question them. Rationalism compels us to have another look at these absolute truths, which, actually, have never existed. Nonetheless, such interpretation of knowledge may be the major weakness of rationalism and reason, because a person, who adheres to such principles, is often unable to accept views of other people. He or she rejects them, just because their validity has not been proven. It is of the crucial importance to be open for discussion and counter-argument.\n\nIn addition to that, rationalism is opposed to doubt; reason can accept only unquestionable, indisputable facts, everything that raises doubts, should be regarded as false. On the one hand, such way of knowing may be very effective, because it gives certain level of certainty, though it also makes us unable to look at reality in different light. For instance, a great number of people attempt to put forward the following argument; usually they say “I do not believe in it, because I have never seen it”. It seems that such viewpoint is based on a very common misconception. There are many phenomena, which cannot be detected by our senses, yet, it does not necessarily mean, they do not exist.\n\nTo a certain degree, rational thinking is aimed at analyzing the relationships between the cause and consequence. Yet, it should be borne in mind that this connection is not always clear. In this regard, one may easily say that modern science often labels something as false, just because, the origins of the phenomenon are not obvious. Moreover, in many cases, such approach only hinders the development of scientific thought. For instance, many scholars believe that such notion as telepathy is inconceivable just because they cannot trace it origins. As a rule, they apply the principles of Descartes by saying that until it is proven to be true, they cannot accept it. It seems that such doctrine, though it seems a very prudent one, often leads to a deadlock, which is almost impossible to break. It appears that this is the major disadvantages or reason as a way of knowing and thinking. Those people, who believe that reason is superior to emotions and feelings, deny everything that cannot be discussed or analyzed by means of rational thinking. Moreover, they begin to despise everything, which is beyond their understanding. Many philosophers or thinkers warn people against such attitude towards knowledge, because it leads to intolerance.\n\nOverall, it should be mentioned that there is an age-old conflict between reason and emotion; they are often regarded incompatible with each other. For example, according to Aristotle, we have to set aside all our feelings and emotions, because they prevent us from thinking clearly or rationally to be more exact. Naturally, one cannot deny that in several cases, emotions cannot be trusted, because they may give rise to prejudice and bias. Nonetheless, it should be taken into account that both reason and emotions are based on the information that we receive from our senses. Thus, both of them can be erroneous because human mind tends to misinterpret reality.\n\nTo some extent rational way of knowing seeks some axiom, the fact, which is undeniable, irrefutable. There has always been a heated debate among philosophers whether such axiom exists. For example, Socrates and Plato did not believe in the existence of such unquestionable truth, whereas representatives of Enlightenment tried to elaborate and prove this concept. Even now, this conflict is not fully resolved. Probably, it would be more prudent to view knowledge as a relative concept that depends on the personality.\n\nIn his work, “The Critique of Pure Reason” Immanuel Kant argues that there is the so-called a priory knowledge or absolute truths; thus, they can lay foundations for effective reasoning (Kant, 22). They become cornerstones of our logic and thinking, however, while speaking about such “a priory knowledge”, the philosopher usually refers to mathematics, geometry, physics, and other natural sciences, but there are other areas of knowledge, such ethics and art. A rational action may not be morally permissible and vice versa. Kant tried to use reason for developing moral principles, but on the whole, his ideas resemble Christian or probably it would be better to say religious tenets, which rely on emotions and feelings.\n\nConclusion\n\nTherefore, it is quite possible to arrive at the conclusion that a human being should employ four ways of knowing such reason, perception, emotion, and language; otherwise, his or her world-perception may be significantly distorted. As regards, reason, in particular, it should be pointed out that its major strength is elimination of prejudice and bias. Nevertheless, such way of thinking has certain disadvantages, namely, it can makes a person very limited, unable to accept views of the opponent, just because they are not evidence-based. Overall, the applicability of reason greatly depends upon the area of knowledge, for instance, such approach to knowledge is very effective for natural sciences or mathematics, though, it may not always be useful in ethics and arts.\n\nBibliography\n\nImmanuel Kant, John Miller Dow Meiklejohn. “Critique of Pure Reason”.

      "John F. Kennedy and Vietnam Essay\n\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy was one of the most outstanding people in American history. He was the 35 th President of the United States, a Democrat, who served his country and its political interests until he was assassinated in November 1963 because of his involvement with the Vietnam War (or, to be more exact, his being opposed to it). John Kennedy was the second youngest American President who started ruling the country at the age of 43. Notwithstanding his young age, he was the only president of the United States who won a Pulitzer Prize and who was loved by practically every citizen of his country. John Kennedy’s significance for the Vietnam War era is hard to overestimate; his loyalty to his convictions, generosity, and justice could help him to withdraw from Vietnam if he was not assassinated in 1963.\n\nFirst of all, Kennedy displayed his qualities of a committed and faithful to his convictions political leader as soon as he was elected as a president. Kennedy believed in communism and decided at once to support the policy of his predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, who was a supporter of the government of Diem. Shortly after the inauguration, Kennedy “also made it plain that he supported the ‘Domino Theory’ and he was convinced that if South Vietnam fell to communism, then other states in the region would as a consequence” ( John F. Kennedy and Vietnam, 2009, para. 1). Kennedy knew that such a position was rather conflicting, but he did not wish to withdraw because he remained faithful to his convictions. This makes him a significant figure even in terms of the Vietnam War era.\n\nSecondly, Kennedy has shown his worth as a generous and caring ruler when he financed the increase of the South Vietnamese Army and provided support to it. In 1961, Kennedy increased the Army by another 20,000 people (which made it 170,000 people). In addition, he sent 1,000 advisors to South Vietnam; this action aimed to ensure a sufficient level of training for the South Vietnamese Army. These two decisions, however, were never made public because they contradicted the Geneva Agreement of 1954 ( John F. Kennedy and Vietnam, 2009). Therefore, such a support to the South Vietnamese Army (even though Kennedy was taking risks when providing this support) points at the unbelievable generosity of this U.S. president.\n\nAnd finally, Kennedy was a just person who, though he supported Diem at the beginning, chose to overthrow him after he found out the position of the members of his government towards the Buddhist monks’ mass suicides. During his presidency, Kennedy got convinced more than once that Diem’s policy was different from what he believed it to be. His government appeared to have consisted of merciless and cruel people. In 1963, Buddhist monks started to commit mass suicides by burning themselves, which the members of the Diem government commented sarcastically stating “Let them burn, and we shall clap our hands” ( John F. Kennedy and Vietnam, 2009). Such a position, according to Kennedy, could never unite South Vietnam, which served as a sufficient reason for overthrowing the Diem government.\n\nIn conclusion, the good qualities that John Kennedy possessed were indeed numerous. He was a committed political leader loyal to his convictions, a generous and caring ruler who never grudged money to help other people, and a just person who could not stand human lives being neglected. This explains why every single American was crying when John Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nReference\n\nJohn F. Kennedy and Vietnam. (2009). Web.\n",
      "Electronic Contracting: Analysis of the Issue, Advantages, Disadvantages and Process Essay\n\nAnalyzing the issue of electronic contracting, it can be stated that most of the people who are regularly using personal computers and internets already participated and confirmed their advantages of such approach. Most of the people have at least once signed an electronic contract, even if they were not aware of such factor. Instances of installing particular software, using services of a specific website, and buying from electronic store, imply agreeing on terms and conditions of a contract and accordingly implied a transaction, if the product or a service was not free.\n\nIn that regard, it can be assumed that such instances of buying or using retail products would not contain much controversy in solving disputes, although it will not exclude such cases. Nevertheless, when electronic contracting is related to business-2-business deals, and where contract agreements require more than just clicking on the “I agree” button, the issue of electronic might have far more impact and accordingly potential hidden pitfalls. This paper examines the issue of electronic contracting providing a brief analysis of the long term impacts of electronic contracting and potential pitfalls.\n\nOne of impacts of electronic contracting can be seen in the sufficient increase in the efficiency of business transactions, specifically in the cases of international trade. Such consequence can be logically expected, as in case the standards of the electronic contracting will be settled, business deals can be agreed upon and completed in minutes. Thus, the use of IT in business-to-business contracting processes will most likely result in optimization and globalization through improving the speed, efficiency and reach of the business processes (Angelov & Grefen, 2001).\n\nAnother possible impact of electronic contracting can be seen through the security requirements for making transactions. In that regard, it can be predicted that a whole sector in the security industry will emerge as one of the most demanded in the electronic business. The security issues are of special concern to the e-business today, thus, it can be assumed that in case electronic contracting will be the most frequent option in business, the demand for security solutions will increase sufficiently. Additionally, a rise can be predicted in the services of 3 rd party online witnessing and authentication, such as Data Witness SignOff (Datawitness, 2009).\n\nThe pitfalls of electronic contracting can be predicted in several issues. One issue can be seen in the differences in the jurisdiction of different countries on electronic contracting. For example, cases when a deal should be made between a country which have an electronic contracting law and a country which does not, the options are to chose either a jurisdiction where the contract will be interpreted and enforced, a process that might require long negotiation, or using a paper contract (ABANET Newsletter, 2002). Such differences might lead to that the process of negotiating and confirming the rules and the type of legal agreement to be followed will eliminate any efficiency advantage of electronic contracting. This statement can be specifically true for single operations, in which the partners intend to sign a one-time deal.\n\nAnother possible pitfall for electronic contracting can be seen through the requirement of specific technological standards, which potentially might differ from country to country. Accordingly, the introduction of new technologies will result in certain countries transferring their operations to the standard, while the others do not, which might create a disagreements between the parties when conducting a deal. It can be assumed that the introduction of universal standards might be a solution, but nevertheless, the differences in specifications between the vendors can still be a problem.\n\nIt can be concluded that electronic contracting is a perspective approach, which is already being implemented in the sphere of business. The analyzed impacts and potential pitfalls, even if taking place, will not hinder the development in that direction. The current growth of e-commerce demonstrates a demand for electronic contracting, and therefore it will certainly be fulfilled.\n\nReferences\n\nABANET Newsletter (2002). E-Contracting Guidelines.

      "Will Stimulus Package Work? Research Paper\n\nThe US economy is still reeling from the effects of one of the worst financial crises to ever occur in recent times. Triggered by a mortgage crisis which initially became apparent in 2007, America witnessed the rapid collapse of major investment banks and a subsequent tightening of credit which plunged the economy into recession; leading to massive layoffs and a rapid increase in unemployment levels (CBCNews*). Wall Street, in particular, was the hardest hit by the tough financial times, and so many people lost their jobs (Dickler*). In February of 2009, it was reported that the US unemployment rate had soared to the highest level in the last 26 years, and it was estimated that around 12.5 million Americans were jobless.\n\nThis figure is still expected to rise, reaching an unemployment rate of 10% by the end of year 2009 (Evans, A1). Certainly, the tough economic times that America is facing are not about to end any time soon. In response to this crisis, the federal government gave the go ahead for the use of an economic stimulus package that is expected to aid the economy in recovery. On the 17th of February 2009, U.S President Barrack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This package offers tax cuts and is expected to trigger spending. However, this package has faced opposition from a cross-section of the public. The idea of borrowing money and spending out of the economic crisis does not seem to be a very sound economic decision due to the risk of falling further in debt and also places the producer at risk. Though based on some economic concepts, it is possible that the stimulus package may not work.\n\nWhat the US stimulus package is all about\n\nThe US stimulus package is under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which was signed into law on the 17th of February 2009. The total cost of the stimulus package is US$ 787 billion. The money will be spent in three major categories: Tax relief, appropriations and direct spending. Tax relief is targeted at individuals as well as businesses through the larger portion is targeted at the individuals. It is expected to consume a total of $212 billion which is 27% of the total stimulus package (Sahadi **). The tax breaks available to the individual have been broken down as follows:\n\nMaking work pay credit : this grants credit equivalent to 6.2% of pay up to $400 for each person. If couples file jointly, then it is 6.2% of pay up to $800. The full credit is payable to those earning up to $ 75,000 ($150,000 if it is a couple). A partial credit is also payable to those earning up to $ 100, 000 ($ 200,000 for each couple). For most of the working people, the credit will be paid over a period of time, at approximately $15 for each period supposing there are 26 pay periods in one year. This credit will be refundable, therefore low income families which don’t qualify for the payment of income tax can still access it. The estimated cost of this credit is $116 billion (Sahadi *).\n\nPayment for those not working : for those who for some reason or other are not working, such as retirees or the disabled, the bill caters for them in the form of a $250 payment that will be paid at a go. The estimated total cost for this one time payment is $14.2 billion (Sahadi *).\n\nHigher-income families : the middle and upper-middle-income families are protected by the bill from paying the Alternative Minimum Tax for one year. The estimated cost for this break is $70 billion (Sahadi *).\n\nTemporary deduction for car buyers: those who purchase new cars, motorcycles as well as light and recreational vehicles in 2009 will have temporary deductions on state taxes as well as local state taxes. This deduction is applicable to those who are earning the $125,000 or less, while for joint filers, the maximum pay is $250,000. This deduction is applicable even for those taxpayers who do not itemize, and it may be taken on top of the standard deduction. The total cost is estimated at $1.7 billion (Sahadi *).\n\nTemporary credit for those buying homes: through this bill, the first-time homebuyer credit, which is temporary and refundable has been increased from $7,500 to $8,000. The law which states that the buyer has to pay back the credit if he or she stays in the house for at least three years has also been removed from the list of requirements while the expiry date for the credit has been extended from the 1st of July to the 1st of December 2009. Those who qualify for this credit must have bought a home between the 1st of January and the 1st of December 2009. Those earning up to $75, 000- $150, 000 for those filing jointly- are eligible for a full credit. The estimated cost for this is $6.6 billion (Sahadi *).\n\nNew temporary college credit: the bill also establishes the American Opportunity Tax credit effective 2009 and 2010 which is worth $2,500 from the previous $1,800 Hope Scholarship tax credit. Those earning up to $80,000 or $160,000 for those filing jointly are eligible for full credit, while those who earn between $80,000 and $90,000 are eligible for a partial credit. The break is partially refundable; therefore those who earning too little to pay tax can access some of the credit. The estimated cost for this venture is $13.9 billion (Sahadi *).\n\nTemporary Pell Grant increase: under this bill, the maximum Pell Grant will be increased by $500 to reach $5,350 and in 2010, this figure will reach $5,500. The estimated cost for this bill is $13.9 billion (Sahadi *).\n\nTemporary expansion of child tax credit: the bill lowers the income threshold to $3000 for the child tax credit to be refundable. This applies to 2009 and 2010 and is expected to enable the low income families to access more of the credit. The total cost is estimated at $14.8 billion (Sahadi,*)\n\nTemporary increase in earned income tax credit: Under the bill, the income tax credit will be increased temporarily from 40% to 45% of qualified pay for low income families who have at least three children. This also provides for a marriage penalty respite for those couples who are eligible for at least a proportion of the credit. The estimated cost for this venture is $4.6 billion (Sahadi*).\n\nOther than tax relief, the second category of the stimulus package spending is appropriations spending which is expected to consume $308.3 billion, which amounts to 39% of the total stimulus package budget as per the Congressional Budget Office. Part of this money, $120 billion will go into financing various infrastructure as well as science projects. Not less than $30 billion will be spent on infrastructure projects that are energy related (Sahadi **).\n\nThe last category of the spending package is direct spending which will consume the remaining 34 % of the stimulus package budget; a total of $267 billion. Direct spending involves the increment of unemployment benefits as well as food stamps (Sahadi **). Currently unemployed workers have an extended deadline (until December 31) to register for 20 weeks more of unemployment benefits, while those living in what is considered a high unemployment state can apply for an additional 13 weeks. The weekly unemployment benefit has also been temporarily increased to $25 more than the current $300. The initial $2,400 of benefits in 2009 will not be subject to federal income taxes. The food stamp payments would also be increased by 13.6%, while food banks would be helped to replenish their stock. Local groups which provide assistance to needy families would also be assisted through some provisions of the bill. The bill provides financial support to states so that they can form a contingency fund for a welfare program dubbed Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which will provide direct financial assistance to those who are in need (Sahadi *).\n\nIs the Stimulus Package really feasible?\n\nThe US stimulus package is expected to lift the American economy out of a recession that has plagued it for more than one year now. As a statement of purpose, it is aimed at preserving as well as creating more jobs to enhance a speedy recovery of the economy. Along with assisting those who have been hardest hit by the recession, it will also provide investment opportunities to enhance employment and economic efficiency. Investment in transportation and other infrastructure as well as environmental protection is all aimed at providing long term benefits for the US economy (GPO, H.R. 1-2).\n\nThose who are in support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act have touted it as a viable solution to America’s recession problem. However, the first impression that one gets from reading the bill is just how big the government is spending. Billions upon billions of dollars are being channeled to all sorts of projects, aimed at providing the much needed stimulus. The end result is that the government is faced with a budget deficit which it has to finance through borrowing from outside. The president himself noted that the US budget deficit could surpass $1,000 billion even without taking into account the new spending measures that he has put in place (Harnden *). This means that the federal government may be forced to borrow from outside to finance its activities.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has approximated that the government may need to borrow a minimum of $1.5 trillion in the current fiscal year to fund the stimulus spending. This will inevitably push the US into further debt; a development that may prove harmful for the future of the US economy, which might find itself trapped in a mountain of debt that will haunt the future generations. Besides, the tax breaks are putting a lot of money into the pockets of individuals as opposed to businesses (Ebeling *). While this move is aimed at enhancing consumer spending, it might not provide the stimulus that it is expected to since people will inevitably save a significant proportion of the money that they receive for speculative purposes or they will use it to pay off any debt that they may have accumulated with very little increase in economic activity. Having just suffered from a major economic downturn, it is highly unlikely that there are any Americans who are big on spending at the moment. A better option would have been to give incentives to businesses even as individuals receive tax breaks so that the businesses can pass along the benefits to the consumer in the form of reduced prices.\n\nIt has been observed that stimulus packages do not really work. Several studies have found that stimulus packages in the past which increased government spending actually caused the gross domestic product to decrease by up to 0.36% (Rugy *). A reduced economy definitely does not augur well with businesses since they will be forced to cut back on production; otherwise they risk to run losses. The government is spending more and more money on investment activities, and in the process, it brings about the crowding out the private sector. For this reason, businesses may have to shift to other areas in which they will have a market.\n\nOne of the provisions of the stimulus package for corporates is that those who hire new workers or decide not to lay off their workers will benefit from a one year tax credit. Such a provision is not economically viable since it will induce employers to keep employees even when it is not productive for their businesses. Fewer employees will enable the company to be able to expand in more productive economic ventures that they could initially not access due to limited finances. The worst bit of the economic recovery plan is that it harms the entrepreneur. Since the government is borrowing at a relatively low rate, there isn’t much capital at a higher rate for the entrepreneurs to be able to use human and physical capital more effectively. Thus the measures have been labeled as “anti- entrepreneur” (Tamny *). It is also possible that the increase in welfare might make the people less motivated to look for employment such that by the end of the day, the American economy might have people feeding on the sweat of other people.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe US economy is knee deep in recession with one of the highest unemployment rates to ever be recorded since the 1980s. For this reason, it is in dire need of an economic recovery plan that will give it the much needed boost and enhance growth. The Obama government has rolled out a fiscal stimulus package which is meant to enhance spending and in the process, give the much needed turnaround to the economy. Unfortunately, it is possible that this stimulus package may not really work. The United States is already faced with a huge debt burden and increasing it may not be in the best interests of the future. Besides, consumers are not likely to spend more just because their disposable income has been increased. Thus the stimulus package will not work and the government should urgently consider a new package that is less spending oriented.\n\nReferences\n\nCBC News.

      "Sociology by Richard Schaefer Essay\n\nThere is no denying the fact that poverty has been one of the most important and urgent social problems of humanity and a constant subject of sociologists’ work. A striking example is a fact that “approximately one out of every nine people in the United States lives below the poverty line established by the federal government” (Schaefer 226). Still, despite the fact that sociologists devote much time and effort to the study of poverty with the purpose of its eradication, they come across numerous problems from the very beginning, with the task of defining poverty (Schaefer 226). In order to give a complete sociological analysis of poverty, the phenomenon should be studied from the following perspectives: conflict theory and structural functionalism.\n\nIn the first place, a reference should be made to Karl Marx, who analyzed exploitation poverty that was caused by the exploitation of the working class by the rich owners of the property and singled out its positive meaning and impact on society. In the “Poverty of Philosophy,” he stated: “they see in poverty only poverty, without seeing therein the revolutionary subversive side, which will overturn the old society” (Marx 137). Thus, Marx treated poverty as the driving force of revolutionary actions. Still, he also mentioned its negative impact on a representative of the proletariat as it: “distort(s) the worker into a fragment of man” (Marx and Mandel 799).\n\nIt is commonly known that Marx’s critical theory and Weber’s views influenced conflict theory greatly. According to the views of the supporters of this social theory, the development of society is based on several main conflicts: between different classes, races, genders, religions. The perspective of conflict theory may be used as the basis of the analysis of poverty in the world and in the USA in particular. Conflict theorists claim that social inequality and poverty, as their main consequence, are excessive and growing. For instance, it is proven by sociologists that in the USA “class system is more rigid for African Americans” in comparison with other races. The Latino population also owns times less wealth than white people (Schaefer 233). Middle-aged, mostly divorced, women, who have to provide for their children are considered to be the major part of a poor class in the USA. Besides, women have shown much less social mobility than men have. They are unlikely to gain high-income status because they are deprived of the initial capital. On the whole, American society today shows evident signs of feminization of poverty. Besides, conflict theorists prove that society’s institutions (religion, media) contribute greatly to the maintaining privileges by some social groups, while others are in a weaker position (Schaefer 16).\n\nAt the same time, while conflict theorists express great concern upon the number of people who belong to the category of poor people, and society’s unwillingness to create better opportunities and governmental support of this class, the representatives of structural functionalism justify social inequality, stating that it is necessary to some extent. “Social inequality is necessary so that people will be motivated to fill functionally important positions” (Schaefer 221). What is more, functionalists have found certain benefits of poverty to society, such as the performance of dirty work at low cost; the creation of professions that work with poor people.\n\nIn conclusion, it must be mentioned that though these two social theories represent different opinions about poverty, it, certainly, remains one of the main problems of contemporary society. Sociologists should unite their efforts with the government in order to cope with the problem of poverty.\n\nReferences\n\nMarx, Karl and Ernest Mandel. Capital: A Critique of Political Economy.

      "Savings and Investment Central Formulas in Economics Report\n\nEconomy is the science dealing with numerous formulas and equations that allow people monitor the development of the human societies and separate organizations within it. The terms like private, public, and national saving, investment, and equilibrium real interest rate are central to economy.\n\nThe calculation of the private saving (PrS) of Ecoland can thus be carried out on the basis of the formula that extracts consumption (C) from the total disposable income (Y – T) (Hondroyiannis, 2006):\n\nPrS = (Y – T) – C;\n\nGiven the Ecoland figures according to which the total income before taxes (Y) equals 10,000, consumption amounts to 6,000, taxes reach the level of 1,500, and the expenditures (G) equal 1,700, the private saving will be as follows:\n\nPrS = (10,000 – 1,500) – 6,000 = 2,500\n\nAnother important notion to define is the public saving (PbS), which is in the essence the difference between the taxes paid by the company and its expenditures (Mankiw, 2008). In Ecoland, public saving will be calculated according to the following formula:\n\nPbS = T – G\n\nGiven the above figures according to which Ecoland’s expenditures amount to 1,700 and taxes reach the level of 1,500, the public saving will be:\n\nPbS = 1,500 – 1,700 = – 200\n\nThe deficient public saving illustrates the problem in the finance of Ecoland, which needs to pay more attention to its financial policies and especially to expenditures (Mankiw, 2008). However, the national saving (NS) of Ecoland balances the relation between the private and public savings being the sum of the latter (Mankiw, 2008):\n\nNS = PrS + PbS\n\nHaving calculated the PrS and PbS, we can now state that the national saving of Ecoland amounts to 2,300 according to the formula:\n\nNS = 2,500 + (-200) = 2,300\n\nFurther on, the equilibrium interest rate should be calculated using the formula according to which first the investment rate of Ecoland should be defined (Ferguson, 2004). As far as Y (total income before taxes) equals 10,000 being the sum of expenditures (G), consumption (C), and investment (I), we can present it in the following equation:\n\nY = C + G + I, where C = 6,000 and G = 1,700\n\nAccordingly, to calculate I we need to extract the sum of consumption and expenditures from the Y total. Thus,\n\nI = Y – (C + G)\n\nI = 10,000 – (6,000 + 1,700) = 10,000 – 7,700 = 2,300\n\nThus, given the Ecoland investment amount at the level of 2,300, it is now possible to reverse the governmentally used equation for the investment function to calculate the interest rates used at Ecoland. In the equation I = 3,300 – 100r, r is used to reflect the very interest rate we are interested in. So, to calculate this interest rate, i. e. the equilibrium real interest rate we need to extract the sum of the investment from the total assumed to the average income level of Ecoland (Ferguson, 2004). Accordingly, the equation to calculate the equilibrium real interest rate will look as follows:\n\nIf I = 3,300 – 100r, then\n\n100r = 3,300 – I\n\nHaving considered the Ecoland investment and calculated it at the level of 2,300, w can clarify the equation for it to look as follows:\n\n2,300 = 3,300 – 100r\n\n100r = 3,300 – 2,300\n\n100r = 1000\n\nr = 1000/100 = 10\n\nThus, equilibrium real interest rate of Ecoland is 10% as can be seen from the equations used by the government to calculate the company’s investment and from the calculations of private, public, and national savings.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

      "Smoking Causes and Plausible Arguments Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Discussion\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn writing on the cause and effect of smoking we will examine the issue from the point of view of temporal precedence, covariation of the cause and effect and the explanations in regard to no plausible arguments. It is first required to show that the cause happened before the effect which is evident from an example of inflation being a cause for unemployment. It is felt by some that when there is inflation it results in overall reduction in economic activities, which increases cost for employers and hence they have to lay off workers. But some economists believe that they are both interrelated in the sense that if there is an increased workforce there will be higher demand for goods and services which in turn will increase the prices. This would increase costs and the same situation will arise when employers will have no option but to lay off workers. Hence it is difficult to establish a causal relationship in regard to several issues which is also true in the case of smoking. For example in most cases of people who leave smoking, the cause is not the anti-smoking campaigns but the several instances of people who suffer from diseases relating with smoking habits. So here we have an example of the effect being the cause of leaving smoking.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWhile examining the causes of smoking, several combinations of reasons are accountable for the habit and most often results from levels of esteem in individuals in relation to the surroundings and atmosphere they live in. Smoking can initially start amongst youngsters due to peer pressure, inadequate skills to cope with pressure as also the curiosity to try what smoking is all about. People also take to smoking due to familial patterns of addiction. An effect of smoking is the mental stimulus that is experienced with inhaling of tobacco smoke and which is taken by many as getting mental relief and peace during stressful situations. Hence to reduce stress people smoke, which becomes the cause of smoking, but eventually when a person becomes addicted to the habit, it becomes stressful to leave in view of the addiction. So here we have an example of a cause becoming an effect and an effect becoming a cause. But in general terms and more specifically there are several causes of smoking which eventually lead to addiction in the habit and the effects prove to be very harmful to the individual’s health and wellbeing.\n\nMost people who are predisposed to the habit of smoking are often burdened with emotional and mental pressure leading to stress levels that become difficult to get over. Such people are extra dependant on others and exhibit very low levels of tolerance against frustration. This leads them to further indulge in smoking to relieve the stress and to remove loneliness which may enable them to temporarily experience mental peace and some excitement. This way they feel that the boredom and depressions can be removed with smoking. Experimentation with smoking may be a result of peer pressure in that when one sees that several friends and colleagues are smoking, why not he also be a party to the same enjoyment, as is inferred by him. Sometimes people take to smoking in anticipation of removing physical pain, which although is not very widespread.\n\nCigarette smoking is the most popular form of smoking and can result in horrific diseases. Smoking damages the lungs which creates complications in breathing and coughing. Over the long term, smoking can further damage the tissue of the lungs which may cause cancer and related fatal illnesses. A secondary effect of smoking is the adverse impact on the heart which is indirectly caused due to the damage to the lungs since sufficient oxygen cannot be provided to the blood supply due to which the heart is overburdened in working harder to supply oxygen to the entire body. This causes the blood pressure to increase and ultimately may lead to heart attack. Hence it can be seen how smoking can cause harm to the body in a number of ways.\n\nConclusion\n\nPeople who smoke cigars do not develop complications of the lungs and heart since they do not inhale the smoke, but they suffer from other problems in the mouth and throat. The initial effects of smoking cigars are the destruction of the glands in the mouth and nose that play the role of taste and smell. The worst that can happen to a cigar smoker is that he ultimately reaches a stage where he cannot differentiate between good and bad smells and is at big risk of contracting cancer of the mouth and gums. Such smokers are also at risk of suffering from cancer of the throat which means loss of the voice box implying that the person will never be able to speak again.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

      "Libertarians in the US Presidential Election of 2008 Research Paper\n\nThe United States presidential election of 2008 will be held on November 4, 2008. The two major parties of the United States political system already have their respective candidates, for the Republican Party, John McCain, a senior United States Senator from Arizona, and for the Democratic Party, a junior United States Senator from Illinois. Little the world knows that there is also a third party in this year’s election. The Libertarian Party will have Bob Barr as their candidate for the coming elections.\n\nThe Libertarian Party is the third-largest party in American politics. It claims more than 200,000 registered voters. At the public office level, it asserts to have more than 600 people in position; this includes mayors, county executives, county council members, school board members, and other local officials.\n\nThe Libertarian Party was founded in the home of David Nolan in Colorado Springs on December 11, 1971. The founding group includes John Hospers, Edward Crane, Manuel Klausner, Murray Rothbard, R. A. Childs, Theodora (Tonie) Nathan, and Jim Dean. The end of the Gold Standard and the implementation of price controls by President Nixon stimulated the formation of the Libertarian Party. The Libertarians thought that the other major political parties –Republican and Democratic – have deviated already from the libertarian principles of the American Founding Fathers. The libertarian party judges that the present political system is the proper means in effectively implementing the libertarian goals and principles.\n\nThe Libertarian Party stands for the American heritage of personal responsibility, enterprise, and liberty. Libertarians view all men as unique individuals. Libertarians want their people to live free and independent. It wants its people to have the freedom to choose the way they want to live their lives as long as they don’t adversely affect the equal rights and welfare of others. A libertarianism is an approach in politics that is people-centered. It supposes that men themselves have the only right to control their own actions. In connection with this, the role that the government will play is the protector of this right. The government under Libertarian rule will keep its people away from force and fraud.\n\nThe Libertarian platform is guided by the principle of “mutual respect for rights.” Therefore, they believe that in order to create moral and stable societies, individual liberty must be respected. So basically, the Libertarian party’s platform includes strengthening the recognition of the rights of the people and the protection of those rights. In this regard, the party wanted to adopt the laissez-faire principles that would result in the reduction of the role of the state in the economy.\n\nThe effects of this would be the privatization of Social Security and Welfare and deduction of taxes for individuals. For businesses, government intervention will be reduced for local operations and foreign trade. Protection of the rights of the people will be intensified. These include the protection of property rights, freedom of association, freedom of speech, and sexual freedom. The party also opposes civil rights laws that aim to regulate the private sector. Reproductive rights such as access to abortion will not receive intervention from the government. Right to self-defense will be unobstructed. The party also stands for the abolition of laws against victimless crimes, for instance, prostitution and fraternization, among others.\n\nOn the issues facing the United States today, here is the Libertarians party’s stand in all of these. the War on Iraq. The Libertarian party is very specific in that it would like the U.S. troops to be pulled out of Iraq in the safest way possible. In protecting civil liberties, the party likes to repeal the Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act and restricting the Executive Branch from implementing additional limitations that are not set forth in the constitution. Regarding the fiscal situation of the country, the party expects that everyone, including those in the highest positions in the government, to start working on reducing their expenses and promote fiscal adequacy.\n\nThey believe that for the government to enact true tax reform, government spending must be controlled. In reducing crimes, the government will focus on protecting the victims and at the same time make the criminals pay full restitution. In protecting the people, the party’s goal is to double the police resources available. The party also aims to increase employment and improve education because they believe that lack of jobs and education is the root of all crimes.\n\nOn the issue of the environment, the party recognized the need for action in providing a clean and healthy environment. Though, the party believes that it should be a joint effort by all sectors of the country. On international affairs, the party opposes the present U.S. government policy on giving economic and military aid to foreign countries. On the other hand, the party encourages the free movement of humans as well as capital across national borders.\n\nWith the platform prepared by the party, the American people will experience more freedom. Their actions will be subjected to fewer interventions by the government. The end result of all of these will be the reduction of the government size. Many current government functions will be eliminated. The reduced cost in running the government will then be used in implementing the new government’s policies, including the protection of the people from force and fraud.\n\nAs compared to the two major political parties in the United States, the Libertarian Party clearly is the party that wants its people to have all the freedom they want to have. Their goals and policy are basically toward the non-intervention of the government with the people’s rights. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, also wants its people to be free, but at the same time, they believe that government intervention is still necessary.\n\nThe Republican Party has more conservative policies. In terms of the parties’ stand in current issues facing the United States today, the parties have different views. On the issue of same-sex marriage, the democrats are in favor, on the contrary, republicans oppose this, and the Libertarians do not want government intervention in this issue. On the legalization of abortion, the democrats and the Libertarians are in favor of this, but the republicans currently oppose this action. With regard to the universal healthcare issue, Democrats have mixed views, but the Libertarians and the Republicans are firm in saying that they are not in favor of it.\n\nAt the same time, Libertarians and the Republicans agree that taxes must not be increased, but the Democrats have mixed views on this issue. On illegal immigration, the Democrats and the Libertarians all want amnesty and guest workers; the Republicans have mixed views on this. On deficit spending, the Republicans are willing to increase deficit spending, but the Democrats and Libertarians favor its reduction. When asked about the war in Iraq, Democrats and Libertarians are on the same page in opposing the war; the Republicans, however, support the said war.\n\nIn an article written by Bob Barr himself in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, he wrote that rising disappointment with the two major parties is shown by politically active Americans (Barr, 2006). They say this is due to the over-intervention of the government with the people’s rights. The Libertarians thus believe that the people need a new option. An option that gives the people the true freedom they need. But since the inception of the Libertarian party in 1971, the party never succeeded in winning a presidential election.\n\nThe party’s candidates hardy accumulates even a percentage of the votes except during the 1980 elections. On the other hand, a number of Libertarians rule in local public offices. Furthermore, as compared to other third parties, the Libertarian Party is the largest. As mentioned, although third parties don’t perform well enough in the national elections, the presence of third parties in the local political system is very relevant. Albeit they only have a minor presence in Congress, they still bring a major influence in the formation of U.S. policies and in political debate (Nwazota, 2008).\n\nIn addition, though it is mentioned that third parties in the United States political system only gather very small percentages of votes, they do affect the outcome of the election by “stealing” votes from another candidate just like what happened to the 2000 presidential elections. Ralph Nader, the presidential candidate of the Green Party took some crucial votes away from Al Gore that resulted to Al Gore’s defeat.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential elections, the Libertarian Party’s candidate is Robert Laurence “Bob” Barr, Jr. Bob Barr. He was born on November 5, 1948 in Iowa City, Iowa. He has served as a federal prosecutor and represented Georgia’s 7th congressional district from 1995 to 2003 as a republican. He is one of the leaders in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. On his earlier years, Barr already showed high liberal spirits. He has the position of Grand Histor in the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Barr is also a member of the Young Democrats of America and he joined the rally against the Vietnam War.\n\nHis career as a representative in Congress is a very colorful one. He started of as a Republican representative of the 7th congressional district of Georgia. But due to differences in interest and opinions, there came a time that he was named as a libertarian. He criticized the policy of the Bush administration about privacy and other civil liberties which is very unusual for a Republican. He disliked the domestic surveillance program and the warrantless spying on the American people. He said that it is an abuse of the due process rights. In addition, his stand on other issues focused more on the rights of the people. He regretted his vote on the Patriot Act.\n\nHe wanted the U.S. troop to be pulled out of Iraq. He did not oppose same sex marriages and supported other issues that are in face value, typical to a libertarian to agree on. Finally, in the 2004 Presidential election, Barr endorsed in public the presidential nominee of the Libertarian Party and at the same time abandoned the Republican Party.\n\nBarr showed interest in running for the 2008 presidential election early April 2008. he was quoted saying that he would run as the Libertarian presidential candidate if sufficient number of people want him to do so. (Vejnoska, 2008). Eventually, Barr confirmed interest on the 2008 presidential run under the Libertarian party after activists made a Facebook group that aims to draft Barr into the nominations. He formally announced his candidacy on May 12, 2008. After six rounds of voting, Barr turned out to be the 2008 Libertarian Presidential Nominee on May 25, 2008.\n\nAccording to news sources, the candidacy of Barr will make things complicated for McCain in the 2008 election (Sullivan, 2008). Not only that his candidacy will pose a threat on the unity of the conservatives, Barr’s presence in the presidency will drain votes mostly from the McCain. According to the polling done by Rasmussen Reports, when Barr announced his candidacy, the poll resulted in the vote turnover against McCain. Many analysts say that Barr’s candidacy will be a blow to McCain in some states. It is expected that Barr would be on the ballot of at least 49 states. A poll by Zogby Poll indicated that Barr received 6% of the nationwide vote.\n\nAccording to an article by Faye Fiore of the Houston Chronicle, other national polls indicate that his support is only around the low to mid-single digits (Fiore, 2008). In a different context, the tone of these news indicate that many still think that the Libertarian party’s presidential candidate is a spoiler in the elections. They say that he will just remove some votes from the Republican candidate; this time from McCain. The obvious impact of this is Obama, the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, will benefit from the lost votes that McCain suffered. However, Barr is firm in saying that he will not be just a spoiler in the coming election\n\n(Sheinin, 2008). He says that if McCain failed to win the election in 2008, it is not because he spoiled it but because the republicans failed to present a vision and an agenda that the people want. On the other hand, Andy Sullivan of Reuters quoted a statement made by a Southern Methodist University professor Cal Jillson saying that the fight between Obama and McCain will not be close enough to the point where Barr’s candidacy will affect the outcome (Sullivan, 2008). They say that the election cycle here in 2008 is still in favor of the Democrats.\n\nFor the record, Barr’s proposed campaign budget is between $40 to $45 million which is less than half of McCain and eight times less than of Obama. Furthermore, Barr’s presidential campaign is evidently suffering from the lack of seriousness from the public. News articles often make fun of his candidacy; focusing stories on his mustache or his whipped cream controversy he entered himself into when he licked whipped cream off the chest of a woman during a leukemia research. Even Preston, political analyst for CNN, is very firm in saying that he will not win (Preston, 2008). These problems, among others, are the obvious reasons why analysts say that Barr has a very small chance of winning the 2008 presidential elections.\n\nIn my opinion, Bob Barr’s candidacy for the 2008 presidential elections will have an impact on the whole presidential campaign. First, it will give the people a third option. People that are not satisfied or do not believe to the agenda of the two major political party in the country will be given a chance to consider another option. Second, it is of no doubt that Barr will really steal some crucial votes from McCain, although this can only be true if the race between Obama and McCain is so tight. Lastly, because of this threat to spoil votes for McCain, Barr’s campaign, which is believed to be the strongest so far by a Libertarian, will make the other parties especially the Republicans to focus campaign efforts on states that are believed to be the strongest points of Barr.\n\nBy considering all of these factors, the likely outcome for Barr’s presidential candidacy is, defeat. In terms of the campaign fund, which many believes is a great success factor, Barr’s resources are significantly small. The fact that people still do not take his candidacy seriously is also a great indication that he will not have a good chance of winning.\n\nAlthough, he is still only considered as a potential spoiler to the 2008 presidential election, the difference it will make in American democracy is still great. Barr’s candidacy shows that it is always worth the try. No one knows if in the future, the Libertarian party will gain ground in the American political system. But at the present time, it is obvious that the party has not been taken seriously by the people. It will still take time before the party can receive the seriousness they need from the people.\n\nReferences\n\nNwazota, K. Third Parties in the U.S. Political Process. 2008. Web.\n\nPreston, M.

      "Pluralism of Christian Message “Jesus as Savior” Research Paper\n\nIn his book Gagging of God, D.A. Carson argues that Jesus Christ is still the one and only valid means of reaching salvation and being reunited with God. Far from the antiquated concepts of traditionalism, Carson presents his ideas from a very modern context by introducing the concept of pluralism. As he introduces it, pluralism is a natural outgrowth of the modern confusion of the postmodern world that is based on illusionary fallacies. In pointing out what these fallacies are, Carson begins to help his readers trace their way back to Christianity within the modern context. Throughout his book, D.A. Carson examines the philosophical issues of our day through a contemporary pluralist approach, finding Christianity as the answer to each of the fallacies that are revealed.\n\nOne of the elements of pluralism that has served to confuse today’s secular culture is the various approaches that have been taken to the ‘true faith.’ According to Carson, a great deal of the confusion felt by would-be Christians today is brought about as a result of the thousands of ‘Christian’ interpretations of the Bible they are given from numerous, equally valid sources. As various evangelists focus their attention more upon growing their ‘church body’ in the form of growing in physical size of the buildings and metaphysical reach of the pulpit, the original message of the Bible has been lost and seems impossible to find for the average layperson.\n\nIn pointing out how these various conflicting messages have served to confuse the congregation, Carson insists evangelists must return to the text of the Bible and its obvious intentions as a means of finding clarity of message. However, this presents a problem as the Bible itself presents a number of contradictions and ambiguous passages, forcing a degree of interpretation no matter how careful the interpreter and thus introducing the possibility of numerous possibilities, all valid and within a potential ‘intention’ of the original writer.\n\nAlthough it would seem like a self-defining term in many cases, the truth is that pluralism itself has created confusion in many fields, including Christianity. “The only absolute creed is the creed of pluralism. No religion has the right to pronounce itself right or true, and the others false, or even (in the majority view) relatively inferior … In particular it is bound up with the new hermeneutic and with its stepchild, deconstruction. The outlook that it spawns is often labeled postmodernism” (19).\n\nThe three general categories of pluralism Carson identifies are classified as empirical pluralism, cherished pluralism and philosophical pluralism. Empirical pluralism refers to the central physical realities of American society. This form of pluralism refers to the level of protected diversity within the modern culture. Cherished pluralism refers to the cultural sense of pride Americans take in this sort of diversity. They truly believe themselves to be the only ‘free’ nation on earth that permits such individualism and take a great deal of pride in this idea.\n\nCarson identifies philosophical pluralism as the parent of deconstructionism. This philosophy insists that there are no right or wrong answers, only different ways of looking at things. The flip side of this concept, though, is that there is no security or meaning to be found, leaving individuals free-floating and with no direction. The simplest understanding of pluralism, then, is that meaning is only based on the interpreter’s understanding and there is no meaning beyond this.\n\nHowever, Carson argues against this idea. He points out that a strict interpretation of this theory would refute any intended meaning on the part of the author or any shared general understanding of cultural concepts and ideas. Because people in a given society do have certain shared concepts, at least in general terms, and authors use familiar terms of expression and communication to share their ideas, Carson suggests that original intention can be ‘inferred’ to a great degree.\n\nAs this is true, pluralism must also be relative. This means that it has different validity to a given situation or may have no validity at all and can therefore be dismissed from consideration. Using the techniques of pluralism itself, then, Carson illustrates how the central idea is flawed forcing confusion where only clarity should be found.\n\nTo illustrate his conception of the ability to determine author intention, including God’s intention in writing the Bible, Carson insists one must take a long view rather than allowing oneself to become lost in the analysis of minute parts to the point of abstraction and meaningless. Through this discussion, he reveals that even the Bible presents a strong plot-line, through which one can accurately interpret its various subplots and stories. By including in this discussion the various ways in which pluralism has been used to create political ‘spin’ and confuse issues to the point where Americans no longer understand what they are voting for and in other aspects of ‘real’ life, such as in the legal and business worlds, Carson ensures he touches on some nerve for most of his readers.\n\nBy breaking down meaning into its component parts of meaningless sounds, pluralism has effectively removed any sense of solidity in the world, whether one is discussing politics, law, business or religion. However, examining pluralism as it is manifested provides the sought-for escape from madness. Carson continues to point out how a Christian perspective and response, based on information presented in the Bible itself as it was intended to be read, are the most effective means of dealing with these issues.\n\nReferences\n\nCarson, D.A.

      "The Lives and Works of Immanuel Kant, Rene Descartes, and David Hume: Comparison Research Paper\n\nDifferent philosophers have elaborated different views on understanding the world as a whole and society in particular. Philosophers’ theories are this or that way justified and have both supporters and opponents. We are not empowered to say that some theory is more valid and the other is not sufficiently grounded, as each of them is a result of the philosopher’s painful process of thinking and seeking the truth. The current paper is concerned with the investigation of the three genii of philosophical thinking: Immanuel Kant, Rene Descartes, and David Hume. The comparison is expected to be made in terms of the four perspectives:\n\n  * The biographical facts from the lives of the three philosophers;\n  * Their major philosophical views;\n  * The influence that the philosophers had on their contemporaries and future generations, their followers;\n  * The philosophers’ messages and the contemporary world.\n\nStarting with a comparison of biographical facts from the lives of the three philosophers we should admit that Kant (the years of life are 1724-1804) and Hume (1711-1776) can be considered contemporaries, whereas Descartes lived and worked significantly earlier: the years of his life embrace 1596-1650. Kant was born in the East Prussian city of Königsberg to a family of a craftsman; he was the fourth of eleven children. Descartes was born in La Haye to a family of a lawyer and magistrate. He was one of surviving two siblings and two half-siblings. His mother died a year after his birth and he with other children was raised by their grandmother. Hume was born to a moderately wealthy family from Berwickshire Scotland, near Edinburgh.\n\nAs far as the education of the would-be philosophers is concerned, all of them received higher education. Kant studied at the University of his native city, where afterward he worked as a tutor and professor in philosophy, logic, and metaphysics. In 1770 Kant achieved wide renown through writing his Inaugural Dissertation that focused on the difference between right- and left-handed spatial orientations.\n\nDescartes was educated at the Jesuit college of La Fleche where he was sent to at the age of ten. Descartes studied there for twelve years and then entered the University of Poitiers, in a year he received his Baccalaureate and License in Canon & Civil Law there. Then Descartes entered the army of Prince Maurice of Nassau. Meanwhile, he started his work on the Compendium Musicae, his great essay on algebra. But only in 1637, he made a name for himself by a group of essays on analytical geometry, optics, and meteors.\n\nHume’s background was shaped by Calvinistic and Whiggish views of his family. During his childhood, he attended the local church. The primary education he received from his mother who educated him until the age of eleven when he left for the University of Edinburgh. Hume’s devotion to Calvinism left a significant mark on his later life.\n\nSeveral words should be told about the way the great philosophers’ lives ended. Kant died peacefully in his bed at the age of eighty.\n\nDescartes died of pneumonia in Stockholm. He had been invited there to teach Queen Christina of Sweden. His disease might have been a consequence of immune system problems. The thing is that he was commonly asked to teach the Queen early in the morning that was not beneficial for his health if we consider that he worked late at night. One more possible cause of his disease results from nursing his friend the French ambassador who suffered from pneumonia. At the present day, Descartes’ tomb rests in the church of Saint-German-des-Pres in Paris and his brain resides in the Musee de l’Homm.\n\nHume spent the remaining years of his life in Edinburgh. There he communicated with his friends from the city’s intellectual circles, revised and refined his published works. At the age of sixty-five, he died from an internal disorder he had suffered from for several months.\n\nThe collection of Hume’s chief works includes Treatise Upon Human Natu re (1739-1740), Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779), Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), Inquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (1751).\n\nHume accepts and develops the empirical ideas of John Locke. He concludes that the principle of causality is not valid and that there is not any existing substance in the world. Only sensations can be considered as the only reliable knowledge. The complex interaction of impressions and subjective and phenomenal ideas can explain the laws of the material and spiritual world. Hume negates causality that exists as the fundamental principle of metaphysics and the sciences. Also, he rejects the existence of substance, and questions the existence of God and the immortality of the human soul.\n\nDescartes’ major works are Discourse de la Method (1637), Meditationes de Prima Philosophia (1641), Principia Philosophiae (1644), Les Passions de l’ame Physiological Psychology (1649), Systematic and Mechanistic Study of Nature and Organisms (1664), Le Monde, ou Traite de la Lumiere (1664), L’Homme (1644).\n\nDescartes is considered to be a founder of modern philosophy as he started the new theory of knowledge which serves as a basis for modern Western philosophy. His method of philosophical inquiry is characterized by two features:\n\n 1. It is a method of inquiry (vs. a method of proof): a way of finding out things and making sure one makes no mistakes; the point of view of the ignorant learner;\n 2. It is a method of doubt: a refusal to accept anything as true unless it is absolutely certain (Rene Descartes’ Views).\n 1. \n     1. \n         1. \n\nThis method led to the transformation in the central nature of philosophy which was concerned with answering the two questions:\n\n 1. What exists? (About the nature of the universe, of being): Metaphysics;\n 2. What can I know to exist? (About the nature of knowledge, the mind, reasoning): Epistemology (Rene Descartes’ Views).\n 1. \n     1. \n         1. \n\nDescartes claimed that intuition and deduction are the two operations through which certain knowledge can be achieved. He defined intuition as “the conception which an unclouded and attentive mind gives us so readily and distinctly that we are wholly freed from doubt about that which we understand” and saw intuition as the basis of all certain knowledge (Rene Descartes’ Views). According to him, each deductive step is based on intuition (Rene Descartes’ Views). Cartesian Dualism was based on the two principles:\n\n 1. There exist two kinds of substances: minds and bodies.\n 2. Minds and bodies interact.\n\nAs far as Kant’s philosophical views are concerned we should admit that contrary to most philosophers that wrote their major works being rather young, Kant wrote the most important pieces of his works being at the age of between fifty-seven and sixty-seven: Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783), Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), Critique of Judgment (1790), Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone (1793). Kant’s philosophical views can be summarized as “a synthesis of the Leibniz-Wolffian rationalism and the Humean skepticism” (Kant, 2007, p. 25687). Kant suggested the following term for his insights into the nature of knowledge: “the Copernican revolution in philosophy” (Kant, 2007, p. 25687). Kant claimed that human attempts to understand things in themselves were doomed to failure. The human field of knowledge according to him is limited to the world of phenomena. The phenomenal experience is based on the work of causality and substance.\n\nIn his works, Kant focuses on the three great problems of metaphysics: God, freedom, and immortality. His point is that they are insoluble by speculative thought. “Their existence can be neither affirmed nor denied on theoretical grounds, nor can they be scientifically demonstrated.” (Kant, 2007, p. 25687) Still, Kantian moral philosophy shows the necessity of a belief in their existence.\n\nThe views of the three philosophers considered we conclude that they are better understood in their complex interconnection. This happens because Kant developed a theory that included both the world of empiricism and rationalism and ruined the imbalance between them.\n\nOne cannot overestimate the impact that the philosophers’ works had both at the time they lived and for the coming generations. Kant’s works were a springboard for the development of German idealism represented by Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. Neo-Kantianism movement that emerged at the end of the XIX century had many branches throughout Europe. The most influential of them were the Marburg school and the Heidelberg school (founded by Cohen and Cassirer and Windelband and Rickert, respectively). The Marburg school focused on the application of Kantian ideas to an understanding of the physical sciences, the Heilberg school was primarily concerned with the application of his ideas to understanding the historical and cultural sciences. Kantian philosophy influenced Hamilton and Green’s works through which Kantian ideas influenced English. Kant’s contribution to theology is obvious in the works of Schleiermacher and Ritschl. In psychology, Kant’s ideas were supported in Gestalt psychology by Köhler.\n\nDescartes’ influence on philosophy is obvious. His Cogito Argument symbolized the centrality of the self and the neglect of authority from without. In physics, the value of his works consists in the rejection of scholastic physics of matter and form. Instead, scholastic physics was replaced by a mechanistic physics of matter and motion (Garber). In biology, he is noted for the rejection of Aristotelian vitalism.\n\nDescartes had a lot of followers in France. There Clerselier’s circle published all his works and developed his ideas. La Forge extended Descartes’ ideas. Other followers include Regius, Heereboord, Raey, Clauberg. Descartes’ writings were paraphrased and commented on in different ways by his followers in late seventeenth-century Europe.\n\nHume was a follower of John Locke. He contributed to the study of human thought, perception, and understanding of ideas according to principles set by Locke. Different sciences concerned with the development and origins of knowledge benefited from his works. But we would like to focus on the impact that Hume’s ideas had on Kant. Actually, Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason was a sort of response to Hume’s empirical ideas. Kantian study of Hume’s empiricism encouraged him to speak of idealism that empiricism leads to. Analyzing Hume’s observations about the limitations of the human mind while it perceives reality, he claims that some or all objects exist in the human mind only.\n\nHume’s philosophy originated from the eighteenth century but it has a very modern sound. Modern philosophy is characterized by the same attempts to skepticism, subjectivism, and relativism that result from the collapse of all rational understanding that Hume argued for.\n\nContemporary philosophy is also concerned with many of Descartes’ ideas. Many of the contemporary philosophers argue that his doctrine of the soul that is consistent with the Catholic doctrine is not valid, as it leads to the degradation of the body and encourages one’s way to abuse.\n\nKant’s ideas not only bonded the empiricists and rationalists that came before him but left a significant field for investigation in various fields. Today, scholars do not stop debating his ideas, as they are rather topical in relation to contemporary issues.\n\nDescartes, Kant, and Hume investigated the problem of skepticism, but they focused on different perspectives: Descartes was concerned with skepticism about reality as a whole, whereas Kant explored skepticism about causation and Hume investigated skepticism on objective validity of causation. All three theories enlarged the treasury of philosophical knowledge and posed a lot of questions to those interested in uncovering the mysteries of philosophy. We are inclined to think that in these questions the main value of the philosophers’ works is rooted.\n\nReferences\n\nGarber, D. (1998, 2003). Descartes, René. In E.

      "Hell in Dante’s Inferno and Sartre’s No Exit Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Hell in Dante’s Inferno\n 3. Hell in Sartre’s No Exit\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. End notes\n 6. Bibliography\n\nIntroduction\n\nInferno is the first cantica of Dante Alighieri’s The Divine Comedy (written between 1308 and 1021), which has today acquired the status of the central epic poem of Italian literature. The entire poem is written in the first person and is based on Dante’s journey through the three realms of his vision of the Christian afterlife. Inferno, his account of Hell, paints a picture so vivid through its analytic descriptions and its references to the bible that it has become the most famous, and most often read part of the Divine Comedy. 1\n\nNo Exit is an existentialist play written in 1944 by Jean Paul Sartre and where Sartre’s famous quote “Hell is other people” has been derived from. His perception of life was a bleak one, replete with endless pain and suffering and he viewed death as the final nothingness. Hence, hell for him was actually representative of life. His existentialist philosophy is present throughout the play. 2\n\nBoth texts are great works of literature from their respective eras, Inferno being from the 14 th century and No Exit a World War II play, and what truly differentiates both from other writings and authors is the fact they constantly invite new interpretations, as they introduce new ideas and stand the test of time by not becoming archaic. This paper focuses on these two works specifically as both were influential and inspiring writers and both Inferno and No Exit interestingly use hell to be a metaphor not for death, but for life.\n\nFor Dante, the Divine Comedy was not a substitute for the two Testaments, but an extension of them and because of this, Inferno is a critical part because it serves as a reminder of the inevitability of hell and the relentlessly cruel punishment meted out to the unrepentant sinners. Sartre does not describe hell through dreadful portrayals of torture, but rather via feelings of misery and helplessness as the characters wallow in a suffocating atmosphere from where there is no easy exit. And this is not an analogy for the afterlife, but rather for life on earth. Hence both are memorable modern portraits of hell which have a unique and lasting impact on the reader’s mind.\n\nHell in Dante’s Inferno\n\nOne of the most distinct attributes of Dante’s style of writing was that his works were usually very related to the Bible. As Peter Hawkins noted in his essay ‘Dante and the Bible’, “underwriting the entire world in which Dante lived is a single book, the Bible”. 3 The Bible had great authority and Dante directly cited it in his works, more often than any other writer did, and he seemed to be very influenced by it. Hence, it is not surprising that Inferno shows the same version of hell as does the Bible. However, an important point to note is that while reading Inferno, one can not help but agree with Hawkins when he says that the hints to the Scriptures are there “less as a source of proof texts than as a divine ‘pretext’ for his own story”. 4\n\n“Abandon all hope ye who enter here” because Dante’s hell is a place where there remains no possibility of repentance or escape. It is an eternal abode, where nothing will change ever: sinners chose their sins, did not repent and now they will not able to repent ever. Punishment is often given to sinners in the form of contrapasso, which means the punishment fits the crime by either being very similar or completely opposite of the sin itself. Terrifying violence is particularly depicted in the cases where contrapasso is meted out to sinners in each circle of hell. The circles are concentric, and from the first to the next and so on, represent a representing a continuing increase in the severity of sin and punishment, until they culminate at the center of the earth, where Satan is immobilized.\n\nFor example in the Third Circle of hell, Gluttons are punished by being forced to lie in the mud under continual cold rain and hail, in utter filth as they are guarded by Cerberus, a monstrous three-headed dog who had a snake for a tail.\n\n“Thick hail and dirty water mixed with snow/comedown in torrents through the murky air/ and the earth is stinking from this soaking rain” (Canto VI, 10-12).\n\n“His eyes are red, his beard is slobbered black/ his belly swollen, and he has claws for hands; /he rips the spirits, flays and mangles them” (Canto VI, 16-18).\n\nViolence is a characteristic common to most circles of hell, and even before the souls of sinner enter hell, those which were not wanted by hell and heaven alike because of their indecisiveness in life are attacked by flies and hornets. The First Circle contains people who were not actively sinful, but did not accept Christ like the un-baptized and the virtuous pagans and for this they are not meted out any violent punishment, just the grief of separation from God, with no prospect of reconciliation. However, in the subsequent circles, violence is present in varying forms and intensities.\n\nIn the Second Circle, the lustful are punished by having their souls tossed and turned by raging winds, without the hope of rest. This is an analogy for the powerful way in which lust left them helpless in life. The Fourth Circle pits the misers and the spendthrifts against each other as each group pushes a heavy weight against the strong weight of the other group in a repetitive process as sinners are punished for either hoarding possessions or squandering them in their love for material goods.\n\nIn the Fifth Circle, the Wrathful bite and fight each other on the surface, and the sullen or slothful lie under the surface of the marsh. Violence starts escalating with increasing circles as sins become more serious. Heretics (those who chose their own opinions instead of following the teachings of the Church) are punished by being cornered in flaming tombs, suicides are encased into gnarled thorny bushes and trees and Blasphemers live in a desert of flaming sand with burning flakes raining from the sky.\n\nScenes depicting these terrifying punishments are what lead to an understanding of the entire concept behind Inferno. Graphically described punishments coupled with the constant references to the wailing and evil noises of hell engage all the senses of the reader to provide a truly vivid picture of the severity of hell. While Dante ends his poem on an optimistic note with Paradise being the final destination, hell is still the only place for unrepentant souls where they will suffer for eternity. While a thorough discussion on Sartre’s No Exit is to follow, this is one of the similarities between the two works and both Dante and Sartre do not offer any hope to those condemned in hell. However, as we will see next, the former has a distinct theological orientation while Sartre’s focus is more on using hell as a metaphor for life. 5\n\nHell in Sartre’s No Exit\n\nJean Paul Sartre was a well-known French existentialist and No Exit is a clear reflection of his points of view regarding humanity and society. It has three main characters, Garcin, Inez and Estelle, who find themselves in hell, which as represented by Sartre, is a living room with Second Empire furniture. According to Sartre, the premise of existence is to create the meaning and essence of their lives to shape their future, and this is why this room represents hell: each of the characters needs the other two to create a reassuring illusion about themselves, and no power to create their own future.\n\nIn the play, Inez calls “an economy of manpower”, simply a system where everyone exploits everyone else for their own gain and this is the similarity between hell and society according to Sartre. He had a very dark outlook on life, as he considered it to be filled with suffering and meaninglessness. While Dante’s hell had supernatural demons and terrifying physical torture, Sartre’s hell was simply all aspects of reality.\n\nThis hell is markedly different from Inferno in its physicality and appears to be comforting. But in reality, the two depictions share a number of common elements. There is no hope for change or for an end to the trials and tribulations of the members, and there is nothing they can do to get out. Time has no meaning and while No Exit generally does not use violence to convey meaning and is less descriptive than Inferno, both works lead the reader with a feeling of pity and disgust at the helpless fate of the characters.\n\nIn Inferno, punishment was in accordance with sin, and sin for Christians exists in their Scriptures. Sartre however, does not discuss the conditions people must meet to be part of his hell, the torture is just the bleak reality of life as depicted by all three characters when they torture each other endlessly: “When I say I’m cruel, I mean I can’t get on without making people suffer. Like a live coal. A live coal in others’ hearts. When I’m alone I flicker out.”\n\nWhen Garcin complains that he died too early and did not get the chance to make his deeds, the answer Inez gives him, “One always dies too soon- or too late. And yet, one’s whole life is complete at that moment, with a line drawn neatly under it, ready for the summing up. You are- your life and nothing else” is, in a nutshell, Sartre’s illustration of life and responsibility. 6 And the depiction of this drawing-room scene in hell, is highly reflective of Sartre’s doctrine of existentialist morality.\n\nConclusion\n\nDante’s account of hell is detailed, vivid, and passionate as he paints a picture of a horrifying Hell which doles out equal, yet gruesome punishment for sins. Sartre’s hell is not about God or heaven, and very different from what people imagine it to be. He believed that people can create their own hell and while he and Dante both portray the concept of human accountability for actions, Sartre does not believe in divine punishment or reward. For him, hell is a state of mind. However both consider it to be the final destination of those who have been condemned to it, by God or by themselves, and they will stay there for eternity, with no hope of change and nothing to expect.\n\nEnd notes\n\n 1.

      "Mammography vs. Ultrasound for Breast Tissue Analysis Essay\n\nMammography screening is one of the most recognized options for analyzing breast tissue in adult women. Recommendations note that clinicians need to explain all the benefits and drawbacks of this process due to mammogram’s potential in increasing cancer risk (Løberg, Lousdal, Bretthauer, & Kalager, 2015). Nonetheless, mammogram also has different limitations in cancer screening, and they can significantly reduce the effectiveness of this test. For instance, some breast tissue may be considered suspicious on the mammogram but not be breast cancer (Welch, Prorok, O’Malley, & Kramer, 2016). As a result, a patient can undergo unnecessary treatment that causes side effects and lowers one’s quality of life. Women with dense breast tissue are in a group with a higher rate of false mammography results (Hugo et al., 2018). They should be offered to undergo other tests to determine whether they are or at risk of having breast cancer.\n\nOne of the options for patients with dense tissue is ultrasound. This procedure does not use radiation but high-frequency sound waves, which do not have the same adverse effects on patients’ health (Hugo et al., 2018). In contrast, the accuracy of this procedure allows it to be an alternative for women who cannot undergo mammography due to the increased potential of false mammogram results (Hugo et al., 2018). Moreover, if the residence area of a patient does not have mammography equipment available, ultrasound can be used instead. Another option for women with dense breast tissue is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Similar to ultrasound, MRI does not rely on radiation, but its accuracy remains under question for this particular screening (Hugo et al., 2018). Overall, the decision of the advanced practice nurse concerning choosing an appropriate method should be based on a woman’s personal choice, patient history, financial concerns, and equipment availability.\n\nReferences\n\nHugo, H.

      "Art and Science: One Culture or Two, Difference and Similarity Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Main text\n 3. Summary\n 4. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nArt and science are two broad concepts that reflect development of the society and its culture. There is a debate concerning the role and status of these disciplines in modern society and their impact on culture. Both disciplines are influenced by social-historical conditions and social development which has a great impact on their current state. Science and art belong to one culture representing one stage of the social, economic and cultural development of the society.\n\nMain text\n\nScience and art belong to one culture because they reflect discoveries and experiments of the modern era. in both of them, there is knowledge and academic disciplines. Both of them are based on scientific knowledge and principles, rules and procedures. Both science and art belong to one culture and ‘driven’ by one process, creativity. Creativity is applied to theories and knowledge, terms and concepts studies by artists and scientists. Both of them belong to one culture, because they represent practical application of knowledge and creative skills. The process of creativity can be seen as a sphere of research that investigates application of knowledge and practical application of theories (Essays of an Information (a), 4). One might attempt to distinguish as science the endeavor to prepare nitrogen mustard with superior properties as a chemotherapeutic agent and as basic science some general study of cell metabolism. Thus, art uses its own concepts and techniques which help artists to create a conceptually new approach. For instance, the works of Dali and Picasso vividly portray a new vision and representation of the world around them. Artists and scientists discover and analyze the natural world and reflect its changes. For instance, great discoveries in natural sciences during the 19th century coincided with naturalistic movement in literature and art in general, Artists and scientists believe that before any explanation is advanced, an exhaustive collection of instances of a phenomenon should be compiled, out of which axioms regarding that phenomenon will somehow emerge, their correctness being ensured by the infallibility of the data (Essays of an Information (a), 6).\n\nArt and science belong to one culture because both of them are based on scientific discovery and desire for something new. In practice, artists and scientists must usually be satisfied if they discover just some of the sufficient and some of the necessary conditions for the effects under investigation. During every historical period, artists and scientists suppose to reveal an ideal; one, which must be approached gradually, as the conditions sufficient for the effect to be manifested are widened. The knowledge of such conditions has a practical advantage, for it “frees the direction”, that is, it opens up new means for bringing about a desired effect. Both art and science champion experiment and observation against authority and tradition, as sources of knowledge. Although not new in its general outline, the extent and detail of arguments in favor of an experimental method put art and science well ahead of most rivals for the attention and respect of those concerned with scientific method (Essays of an Information (b), 7).\n\nThe main difference between these disciplines is that in science, prediction once made, its confirmation depends often on events over which the scientist can exercise no vestige of control. The real world having been constituted a “something,” the principle of intelligibility asserts man’s capacity, perhaps even his obligation to understand that something. Non-science does not make predictions and does not test hypotheses. It does not multiply and diversifies the range of possibilities humanly attainable, among which researchers choose those they will make realities. Artists and scientists know that common sense is imperfect, and for this reason they usually permit the survival even of relations that yield frequent unaccountable failures in prediction. Science and art giving answer question “Why” and “How” which help them to create a new knowledge and methods.\n\nBoth art and science are based on evidence and explanations, testing and improvements, evaluation and replication. Scientists and artists work with theoretical norms which are not necessarily self-evident, and so gain power to work with a far greater range of possibilities than before. Both art and science belong to one culture because they deal primarily with what is experienced by all mankind; science encompasses, in addition, what is experienced, in the laboratory, by but a few. This distinction seems unimportant: the special experience of scientists is potentially available to all willing to enter the laboratory. As it begins science judges the acceptability of subject matter much as common sense does. As science and art develop, as their view of the world becomes more highly elaborated, they make these judgments differently (Essays of an Information (a), 5).\n\nSummary\n\nIn sum, art and science represent and belong to one culture based on creativity, historical development of society, research and scientific methods of discoveries. The main characteristic of science and art is new knowledge creation, new application of existing knowledge while other academic disciplines use this ready-made knowledge for their purposes.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n 1.

      "Minister: Temptations, Blessings, and Rule of Life Essay\n\nOvercoming Common Temptations to Ministers\n\nAs a Christian leader, one has to show a significant amount of strength in overcoming common temptations. With extensive power to exert over their students and parish members, a minister may fall prey to several temptations, the key ones being the urge to be relevant, the temptation to be spectacular, and the need to be powerful (Mulholland, 2016). The described temptations are very easy to overlook since they are often misconstrued as the logical extension of the willingness to assist those that need guidance and the help of a minister.\n\nHowever, as a pastor, one has to be irrelevant, contain their power, and stifle the urge to show any sign of being spectacular. The described temptations can be overcome by following the virtues of humility and honesty, as well as viewing the nature of God’s love for His children as an entirely unconditional notion.\n\nThe temptation to be relevant is likely to affect the life of a minister in case they forget that serving the Lord and following His Word should be the focus of their efforts and, instead, concentrate on the extent of their power and influence in the community. Although asking oneself a question of how one can help those in need, including the starving and the poor, may seem noble, it, steers a minster away from the needed humility and piety. Therefore, the temptation of relevance as the incentive to an action that may elevate a Christian leader in the eyes of the public represents a serious threat to a minister’s spiritual growth.\n\nSimilarly, the temptation to be spectacular leads to one developing hubris and straying away from the path of spiritual growth. Instead of accomplishing an action for the sake of hearing people’s praise, a Christian leader has to focus on doing good and following essential Christian principles. There is a common misconception that being spectacular is the need to expand the influence of the church and spread the Word of God (Barton, 2006). However, the specified misconception leads to developing dangerous attitudes that will prevent a Christian leader from gaining spiritually and serve as an example for their student and parish embers. In the same vein, the temptation to be powerful may lead to a minister usurping power and developing egotistic tendencies, which is inadmissible for a Christian leader.\n\nExploring the scripture, one will realize that the temptations in question have direct Biblical correlates. For example, the story of Nebuchadnezzar represents a case of falling to each of the three temptations (Mulholland, 2016). By focusing on his ego and dismissing crucial Christian values, Nebuchadnezzar became a tyrant that ultimately had to face his demise (Macchia, 2012). Haman is another example of focusing on power and being spectacular instead of following the principles and values of Christianity. As Mordecai refused to bow to Haman, the latter was filled with rage, which showed that his arrogance ousted his spiritual values (Mulholland, 2016).\n\nTo fight the three temptations mentioned above, a minister should consider several crucial disciplines, which include Contemplative Prayer, Confession and Forgiveness, and Theological Reflection. The identified disciplines will allow one to recall the idea of God’s first love, thus addressing the temptation to be relevant and powerful. The focus on a confession as an important discipline, in turn, will help one to handle the temptation of being spectacular due to the subversion of one’s alleged heroism (Barton, 2006). Finally, theological reflections will lead one back to the idea of being humble and pious.\n\nBlessings for Ministers in their Spiritual Formation\n\nThe process of spiritual formation is quite difficult for a minister to undergo since it required a vast effort in addressing personal flaws and shaping one’s perception of Christian values and notions. However, God gives blessings and gifts to all of His children, and these blessings and gifts are essential for one’s spiritual development. Exploring the role that a minister plays in church and the opportunities that they can pursue in the promotion of Christ’s teachings, one may say that collaboration has a huge potential that a minister can explore. The support that community members give to each other and those in need when following the ideas of Christian unity and sharing God’s Word and love has a profound impact on the spiritual formation of each participant individually and the entire community, in general.\n\nTo accentuate the blessings of sharing God’s love and His Word, as well as strengthen people’s Christian beliefs and support them in their spiritual growth, a minister will need to focus on the notion of unity and introduce people to the idea of a spiritual vision. Taking historical retrospect, one will realize that the promotion of a closer dialogue between a parish member and a pastor has already been explored and implemented successfully.\n\nJohn Wesley introduced the notion of “band meetings” as the strategy for making the communication between a minister and their parish members closer to ensure personal spiritual development in every participant (Barton, 2006). As the described experiment has shown, the proposed approach fosters the enhancement of Christian unity within a parish and reinforces the influence of a Christian leader.\n\nSpecifically, the use of band meetings convinces every participant to follow the essential Christian principles and accept the notions of a preached word and a spiritual vision. The focus on unity and collaboration, including interdisciplinary cooperation within church members, a collaboration between parish members, and the dialogue between a minister and the community, is the ultimate path to a blessing in the work of a Christian leader (Calhoun, 2015).\n\nBy pursuing the notion of unity in the Christian environment, one will multiply the experience of each individual and create premises for everyone to accept the Word of God. Therefore, to reinforce the idea of a spiritual vision within a community, a minister should focus on turning it gospel-centered, as well as multiplying the notion extensively. It is critical to introduce the target population to the idea of becoming disciples and following the Word of God.\n\nPersonal experiences also need to be examined to shape one’s spiritual development as a minister and ensure that the qualities of a Christian leader are built properly. Among the key personal experiences that deserve to be mentioned, the family background has had the most profound effect in shaping personal beliefs. Being a child in a Pentecostal Christian family involved participating in every Christian tradition and ceremony, as well as studying the Bible and gaining insight into its meaning. Representing rather conservative Protestant views, my family has been encouraging me to pursue Christian values and develop Christian virtues since early childhood.\n\nAs a result, the opportunities for developing the attitudes and principles that allowed evolving spiritually and affected the vision and philosophy were discovered. Among the key beliefs that were established since early childhood was the notion of unity across Christian believers and the importance of Christlikeness as a crucial part of a Christian person’s life. Furthermore, with the support of the Pentecostal family, resisting temptations on the way to spiritual growth was accepted as a challenge that one has to overcome as a future spiritual leader (Macchia, 2012). The knowledge of Aviation, Psychology, Criminal Justice Administration, and Bible Theology was also helpful in shaping the qualities of a Christian leader.\n\nThe Rule of Life\n\nIntroduction\n\nSeeking spiritual maturity is one of the crucial stages on the path of a Christian leader’s progress. Therefore, one should focus on examining the ideas that will allow one to discover the rule of life and pursue it in one’s endeavors at becoming a better Christian leader. The described objective is of especially high urgency for a minister since they have to provide spiritual guidance and support to their parish members and the Christian community, in general (Johnson, 1999). By practicing three key disciplines, which are praying, fasting, and studying the Scripture, one will build a strict Rule of Life and follow it closely to exert a positive influence in the Christian community and promote unity across its members, thus spurring their religious development.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe idea of the Rule of Life as a series of beliefs and standards that will allow one to grow spiritually is central to being a Christian leader. Approaching the notion from a personal perspective, one may define the Rule of Life as a series of principles that guide one’s spiritual practices and introduce order to their implementation (Macchia, 2012). Therefore, in the case under analysis, the Rule of Life will imply the focus on close reading of the Scripture regularly at least twice a day.\n\nHowever, fasting as a process of cleansing one’s soul and mind might not seem to be suitable for scheduling (Mulholland, 2016). Indeed, several resources indicate that, as a spiritual leader, one should use fasting when feeling the need to do so or when the Holy Spirit leads one to reconsider one’s physical urges, including the desire to consume food (Killian, 2017). Similarly, praying as a spiritual discipline does not necessarily have a particular deadline.\n\nHowever, to fit the described spiritual practices into one’s life without disrupting other essential aspects thereof, such as communication with family members and the community, scheduling should be considered as a necessity. It is also worth noting that, to enact the described Rule of Life, the approval of the administrative board in the congregation will not be required since the target environment is the Sunday school for adults.\n\nAs stressed above, three key spiritual disciplines have been used to advance Christian values and the notion of Christian unity in the target setting. These include close reading of the Scripture, fasting, and praying. Being a teacher at the Adult Sunday School, I had the opportunity to engage in the described disciplines at my office, using solitude as the means of exploring my spiritual strengths and weaknesses, as well as seeking ways of advancing as a Christian leader.\n\nMoreover, observing Sabbath has been an important part of the rituals that one has to follow as a spiritual leader. Every first Saturday of every month as a holy day in the Baptist tradition has been devoted to spiritual growth. By abstaining from mundane activities that take a significant part of one’s daily routine, one can partake in praying and reading the scripture, thus expanding one’s knowledge of the Bible and Christian ideas and philosophy.\n\nHowever, the process of following the selected Rule of Life was rather challenging due to the tight schedule that a Christian minister typically has to meet. With the constant focus on the needs of the community and other essential responsibilities, one may encounter impressive challenges in finding time to implementing the Rule of Life. As stressed above, rescheduling and reconsidering the approach toward time management were the key strategies for handling the described situation. With the help of elaborate planning, success was achieved in integrating the critical principles of the Rule of Life into daily life without distorting interpersonal relationships, reducing the quality of work, or depriving parish members and students at the Adult Sunday School of communication and consultations on religious and spiritual issues.\n\nThe selection of the disciplines mentioned above can be justified by several important factors. The importance of the dialogue with God as a part of spiritual development has defined the presence of praying in the list of the key disciplines that constitute the described Rule of Life. Since praying allows one to expand one’s relationships with God and develop an insightful understanding of one’s spiritual needs, it has to be incorporated into the Rule of Life principles.\n\nSimilarly, fasting as a means of performing a spiritual cleansing was integrated into the Rule of Life principles. However, the significance of moderation in performing the described practices and placing them in the context of one’s life also had to be taken into account. Thus, the notion of the trellis as a path to an emotionally healthy spirituality was incorporated into the Rule of Life mentioned above.\n\nThus, it is necessary to ensure that the Rule of Life should not be interpreted by general audiences as a set of rigid principles that will absolve their lives of any joy and compel them to follow a preset schedule in a robot-like fashion. On the contrary, the notion of the word “rule” as a part of the Rule of Life has to be perceived by viewing its Latin etymology. According to Scazzero (2006), a trellis is only a tool that one can use to start developing their system of religious beliefs and philosophies that will guide one to Christian life. Specifically, Sullivan (2015) explains that the Rule of Life is a platform based on which one and build the life with which one will be perfectly content and happy: “As a reminder, a rule of life is like a trellis that guides us toward growing in our relationship with God, ourselves” (Sullivan, 2015, p. 99).\n\nTherefore, the Rule of Life has to be promoted organically to every believer to ensure that Christian practices take the required amount of time without enhancing the notion of asceticism to the point where it becomes the source of personal unhappiness.\n\nReinforced by the notion of the trellis as a ritual that allows structuring one’s life and imbues it with spiritual sense, the Rule of Life based on the idea of fasting, praying, and reading the Scripture will allow one to introduce a unique spiritual rhythm into one’s existence. As a result, the processes of praying and fasting will acquire additional meaning and produce a new impact that will help one to study one’s relation to Christian values and philosophy.\n\nThus, the Rule of Life will become one’s trellis that will guide one to becoming a better person and gaining Christian virtues. Simultaneously, the application of the Rule of Life as a personal trellis and a path to spiritual growth will help one to remain untainted by temptations that will surround one in their spiritual development. The described issue is particularly important for a minister to address given the need to represent a positive example and promote unity across the congregation.\n\nThe Rule of Life mentioned above will also require one to follow a set of specific standards for the Sabbath. Being a crucial part of the life of every Christian person, the Sabbath is critical for a Christian minister, who needs to incorporate meditation and quiet contemplations into the process of personal spiritual growth. A close reading of the scripture and praying are the primary disciplines that should be the focus of Sabbath activities.\n\nThus, one will incorporate rest and meditations into the Rule of Life to advance in one’s spiritual evolution. Worshipping God with prayers should also be seen as an inseparable element of the Sabbath practice since the day is expected to be the time for promoting peace and unity across the world (Barton, 2006). For this reason, the incorporation of praying and reading of the scripture should be the main choice for someone practicing the Rule of Life.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that there has been a continuous misconception about the notion of the Sabbath and the purpose thereof. A significant number of people perceive Sabbath as the time during which one has to restrain oneself continuously to avoid any semblance of physical labor and not to inflict God’s wrath upon oneself for performing the labor in question (Barton, 2006). However, the implicit meaning of the Sabbath is, in fact, entirely different and has nothing to do with the concept of punishment or idleness. Quite the contrary, the Sabbath tradition suggests that one should focus on worshipping God and exploring one’s spirituality, thus, engaging in the activities that will allow one to evolve and reach a new stage of development.\n\nMoreover, the idea of the Sabbath practice also involves emotional upheaval and calls Christian people to rejoice and celebrate God (Vardy, 2016). Therefore, the focus on praying and reading the Scripture on Sabbath should not be deemed as an activity that drains the joy from the lives of believers. Instead, the process needs to be seen as an opportunity to regain the connection with one’s true self and the chance to focus on relaxation and meditation as important aspects of spiritual growth.\n\nTo support the idea that the Sabbath encapsulates joy and delight, one may need to consider the teachings of Jesus and His attitude toward the Sabbath. For instance, Scazzero (2015) explains that “On Sabbath, something of God’s holiness and goodness is revealed, not simply in the way he works but in the way he rests” (p. 168). Therefore, the Sabbath practices should be regarded as an important and joyful aspect of Christian practices.\n\nIn addition to engaging in several crucial spiritual and religious practices that allow one to gain the skills of a Christian leader, a minister should also consider setting attainable goals for spiritual formation and locating key milestones that will have to be reached to maintain personal growth consistent and effective. For this reason, key physical and spiritual practices need to be reconsidered and reevaluated as the strategies for reaching the required goal and gaining the necessary strength. Thus, the use of inward disciplines as the source of strength should be seen as the most important aspect of the Rule of Life presently.\n\nAs a result, the significance of humility, kindness, and other essential Christian values that would help later on to gain the skills needed for a Christian leader are recognized and integrated into the process of personal development.\n\nTherefore, the goals of the spiritual formation process currently include mostly the objectives associated with inward disciplines of Christianity as the gateway to understanding one’s personal needs for the promotion of spiritual growth. The key objective is to explore the current weaknesses as a minister and a Christian to continue working on addressing them. Being a Christian leader and a teacher in a Sunday School for adults, one cannot afford to make mistakes that were caused by personal flaws and may come at the price of other people.\n\nThe current level of spiritual maturity seems to be quite high, as the previous assessment has shown, yet more effort should be put into focusing on avoiding temptations, particularly, the temptation to be relevant. Thus, it is crucial to continue identifying weaknesses and problems in the current management of temptations, especially the temptation to be powerful and relevant.\n\nWhile the described characteristics ostensibly seem to serve one in assisting those in need, they will ultimately lead to the cessation of one’s spiritual; progress and the ultimate failure as a Christian leader (Oswald & Kroeger, 1992). Therefore, locating the existing weaknesses and managing them so that they could not lead to any harm made to the Christian community is listed among the top priorities. In addition, enhancing the strengths that will allow encouraging unity in the target environment is also among the key goals.\n\nFurthermore, maintaining physical well-being at the desired level by following fasting principles is another one of the objectives to be pursued. The use of fasting assists not only in spiritual cleansing but also in maintaining the required physical shape, which a minister needs to have to focus on humility, avoid excessive consumption, and lead a humble life. Therefore, the selected spiritual disciplines help in setting measurable and attainable goals that a minister should reach to exert positive influence within a community.\n\nAs explained above, reading the scripture is a crucial stage of the spiritual development of a minister. While every single part of the scripture bears a special meaning to its reader, specific parts can be seen as especially important for establishing a personal connection to God and at the same time embrace the corporate aspect of spiritual development. The idea of being connected to God relationally is one of the crucial aspects of building one’s spirituality and embracing the notion of Christian values.\n\nThese include the concept of Christlikeness and the acceptance of Christian virtues (Hamm, 2017). The described perspective also allows facing temptations of relevance, power, and being spectacular since it provides a minister with a chance to foster the qualities such as humility and Christlikeness. Thus, to improve one’s relationships with God and establish a strong connection, a close reading of the Holy Scriptures, specifically, the Epistles, is an essential component of the spiritual practice.\n\nFurthermore, introducing order to these practices by timing them and scheduling the key activities should be seen as the main step in creating an appropriate environment for establishing the Rule of Life. The described activities are believed to assist one on one’s journey to becoming an effective Christian leader and keeping the focus on the important aspects of leadership. The promotion of unity and the focus on increasing well-being, at the same time resisting temptations, should be deemed as the key objectives to be accomplished.\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing Christian practices such as fasting, praying, and studying the scripture, one will discover the rule of life and become able to follow its principles to offer parish members guidance while retaining humility and resisting temptations. The introduction of the described elements into the process of following the Rule of Life is essential since it helps one to embrace one’s Christian nature.\n\nThough the concept of the Rule of Life is often interpreted as restrictive of reducing one’s life to ascetic values, thus depriving one of a range of essential activities, this could not be further away from the truth. Instead, the Rule of Life allows one to develop a system of principles according to which one can fulfill oneself as a Christian leader and a believer. Thus, applying the Rule of Life to one’s everyday activities and especially the spiritual practices that are expected to assist one in their spiritual growth, will lead to becoming a better Christian.\n\nReferences\n\nBarton, R.

      "Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Girdle Pain Case Study\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Background\n 2. Case History\n 3. Treatment Plan\n 4. Expected Outcome\n 5. References\n\nBackground\n\nPregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP) describes the pain occurring in lumbosacral, sacroiliac, and symphysis pubis joints (1). It represents significant discomfort to pregnant women and requires timely identification, assessment, and appropriate treatment (2). The pain can be safely treated at any stage both during pregnancy and after birth as soon as a patient reports reoccurring symptoms. Scholars have reported that the problem is often underestimated because many women experience them, with the condition not considered dangerous (3). In addition, there is an issue of inconsistency associated with the lack of consensus associated with the incidence, treatment, clinical manifestations, and the final outcomes of PGP (4). The lack of consistency is also supported by the fact that PGP does not have known exact causes, with some patients experiencing mild symptoms and others being in serious pain (5). Therefore, it is essential not to overlook the adverse impact of PGP and implement cohesive treatment and management strategies to relieve patients’ pain and discomfort.\n\nCase History\n\nMrs. J, a 32-year old female at 34 weeks of gestation, presented to the healthcare provider with complaints of low back pain and anterior pubic pain (6). The woman reported having difficulties lifting her leg, the inability to stand on either leg, pain in the hips, and the restriction of the hip movement, as well as frequent nerve pain down the leg. The current pregnancy is the patient’s first; thus, there is no history of having similar symptoms in the past. Upon interviewing the patient, it was revealed that the pain enhances when she is walking and going both up and down the stairs and turning over in bed (7). When questioned regarding rating the level of pain from 1 to 10, the patient reported her pain at the level of 7. The patient wanted to take some over-the-counter pain medication but was unsure whether they would be safe during pregnancy.\n\nTreatment Plan\n\nThe treatment plan for the 32-year old patient is recommended to combine education and physical therapy methods (8). Patient education is necessary to provide the necessary information on the condition, develop self-care interventions for addressing pain, and identify high-risk symptoms to refer to a healthcare specialist immediately (9). Offering adequate information and reassurance of the patient is an essential step since the plan involves a pregnant woman who requires the support and understanding on the part of her healthcare provider (10). The pain and discomfort associated with PGP contribute to declining mental well-being, which decreases the quality of life and puts the patient in a negative headspace in regards to pregnancy (11). Therefore, prior to implementing an intervention that will include exercises and attempts to relieve the pain with the help of physical methods, patients’ stress levels should be addressed.\n\nFrom the physical therapy perspective, it is suggested to introduce such practices as manual therapy, exercise therapy, joint mobilization and manipulation, and physical conditioning (12). The patient will be presented with a physical therapy plan that will include stabilizing exercises (13). The physical aspect of the treatment plan is targeted at developing management strategies that the patient will find possible to implement and easy to follow. For example, during physical (or work) conditioning, existent or simulated work tasks can be performed (14). Manual therapy, which implies joint mobilization and manipulation, is an intervention that is recommended for implementation to restore the normal motion of the joints through administering low-velocity movements within the limit range of the joint’s motion (15).\n\nExercises therapy is seen as the most promising aspect of the intervention because of the possibility to include a range of exercises and movements with various types of targets – from flexibility to mild strength training (16). Exercises that target the improvement of muscle function and motor control must take place without provoking any pain. Individualizing such exercising to the extent of the patient’s PGP is an essential step to ensure that she is not experiencing any severe pain when completing the plan (17). Thus, the treatment plan for the patient is two-fold and implies education as well as distinct physical activities that the patient can do at home.\n\nExpected Outcome\n\nThe improvement of the general well-being and the enhancement of the physical state of the patient are expected. The intervention may work through the attention to physical conditioning, which is expected to increase the emotional, psychological, and physical tolerance of the patient (18). From the perspective of manipulative theory, it is thought that manipulations administered to the patient, such as massages or manual therapy (19), will reduce internal mechanical stresses and reduce the adverse influence of the symptoms on the quality of the patient’s life (20). The massage of the soft tissue administered to the patient has the potential to block the pain nociception through the stimulation of nerve fibers and activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. In addition, the massage can have a positive influence on stimulating endorphin and serotonin release, which are beneficial for improving the overall well-being of the patient experiencing PGP.\n\nReferences\n\nWellock V, Crichton A.

      "Manage Stakeholder Expectations Determine Requirements Report (Assessment)\n\nStakeholder Management\n\nOne of the essential elements of project management is the necessity to establish, develop, and regulate relationships between all individuals involved in a project. In general, any project management inevitably needs the identifying of stakeholders, the analysis of their impact on the project, the examination of communication strategies, and the management of stakeholder expectations. Effective management of stakeholder expectations implies that all project requirements are determined and aligned, and all potential risks are identified and elaborated. It is evidence of the project’s sustainability and the main component of a healthy project environment.\n\nThere are several significant steps to the efficient management of stakeholder requirements that inevitably determine project requirements. First of all, the identifying of stakeholders that are involved in the execution of the project is obligatory.\n\nStakeholders may either positively or negatively affect the project in the dependence on their personalities and requirements. In addition, it is crucial to specify the stakeholders’ preferable method of communication to ensure their awareness and satisfaction. Every concerned person may have his or her own favorite way of interaction, and the wrong or non-preferred method may cause stakeholders’ frustration, distrust, and certitude that their requirements were not heard. To avoid this, stakeholders should be engaged in the process of decision-making and the project’s elaboration and execution by questioning them to receive feedback.\n\nQuestions to stakeholders are a highly accurate, reliable, and meanwhile simple way to manage their expectations as well. These people should be asked how they estimate the project’s potential and prospects of success; this point is immeasurably substantial as various stakeholders have different definitions of success. Some of them regard meeting the deadline without delays as their priority while others focus on the functionality of a product or the safety of its manufacture.\n\nDetermination of Requirements\n\nThe identified stakeholders for the WPI Project of the Clay Oven’s implementation are a client (the sponsor of a project, Vance “Smokey” Wilson), student groups, and the administration of the WPI Campus that serves as the facility host. The sponsor expresses a high interest in the project and actively participates in its elaboration; for interaction and cooperation, face-to-face meetings and telephone communication were chosen.\n\nHe emphasizes the meeting project’s requirements and the importance of its execution without delays. That is why the project schedule of the planning and installation of the WPI Campus’s clay oven is thoroughly elaborated to exclude any lateness. Moreover, this stakeholder added several changes concerning fire code requirements, the inclusion of additional information in the brochure, and the integration of students into construction. All these expectations were considered, and the requirements for the construction were updated – applicable fire codes were researched, recipes were added, and the schedule for the additional workforce was modified.\n\nStudents groups have a moderate interest in the project, and the providing of the students’ feedback and their informing are executed through surveys and face-to-face meetings. They require an accessible and functional oven that will be convenient to use. According to their expectations, the parameters of the oven and its location near the existing charcoal grill were examined and chosen. The administration of the WPI Campus has the lowest interest in the project in comparison with other stakeholders. It primarily expects the safety and legality of the project, that is why all legal regulations and safety requirements were accurately researched and checked. The oven’s configuration and location meet the standards of safety and fire code as well.\n",
      "Hyperlipidemia and Medication Treatment Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Overview of Hyperlipidemia\n 3. Treatment principles\n 4. Anti-Hyperlipidemic Drug Classes\n 5. Monitoring Patients and Patient Variables\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nHyperlipidemia is an abnormally elevated level of lipids or lipoproteins in the human blood. It is a critical risk factor for cardiovascular disease, mainly due to the significant effect of cholesterol on the development of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, hyperlipidemia syndrome develops in many diseases, makes their course more severe, and leads to complications. Treatment of hyperlipidemia is crucial for the prevention of atherosclerosis, normal functioning of organs, long and active life. This essay provides a brief overview of the disease, describes some treatment principles and anti-hyperlipidemic drug classes, and discusses monitoring patients and their variables.\n\nOverview of Hyperlipidemia\n\nHyperlipidemia is a consequence of a person’s lifestyle, eating and bad habits, and the types of medications he takes. Moreover, given that he or she has diabetes, reduced thyroid function, or a woman is pregnant, hyperlipidemia develops more actively. However, this disease can be familial if one has a normal weight and leads a healthy lifestyle. With familial hyperlipidemia, a person may have signs of high cholesterol, which are yellowish fatty growths around the eyes or joints (Shattat, 2014). Otherwise, hyperlipidemia has no signs or symptoms, and high cholesterol may go unnoticed. The patient may have a myocardial infarction or stroke and only then learn that he or she has hyperlipidemia (Shattat, 2014). Excess lipids accumulate in the blood over time, forming plaques on the walls of arteries and blood vessels. These plaques constrict the lumen of the vessels, creating a turbulent flow of blood through them, which leads to a greater load on the heart to pump blood through the constricted areas.\n\nTreatment principles\n\nThe most critical thing in hyperlipidemia treatment is to find and remove the causes that provoked an increase in the level of fats in the body. Diet and lifestyle correction is one of the key conditions for successful treatment (Yassine, 2015). As a rule, in the early stages of hyperlipidemia, it is enough to adjust the diet and lifestyle to normalize the level of fats in the body. Drugs are usually prescribed to people when diet therapy did not help them during the first month of treatment. As for the evidence-based approach, it is helpful to manage patients with hyperlipidemia effectively. Varras (2016) states that “based on the evidence, statins are the medications of choice for most patients who need lipid-lowering therapy” (p. 17). More than that, the detection of various risk factors will determine the appropriate Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) level for a particular patient.\n\nAnti-Hyperlipidemic Drug Classes\n\nIn the case of hyperlipidemia, physicians usually prescribe medications of six drug classes. They are statins, bile acid-binding resin, fabric acid derivatives, nicotinic acid derivatives, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, and inhibitors of cholesterol transport from the intestines. All of them decrease LDL, and the first four increase HDL (Shattat, 2014, p. 404). In addition, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as ezetimibe, also lower cholesterol (Saely et al., 2017). Besides, statins, for example, lovastatin or simvastatin, increase Triglyceride Levels.\n\nMonitoring Patients and Patient Variables\n\nIn the beginning, patients should be treated for the metabolic condition exacerbating hyperlipidemia. Different variables, such as Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), and Triglyceride Levels (TG), should be monitored appropriately (Varras, 2016). If a person has diabetes, his or her glucose level and glycosylated hemoglobin are necessary to be normalized. While managing hyperlipidemia, it is essential to consider statin therapy for all patients, as it reduces mortality and coronary heart disease. Moreover, patients who are treated with lipid-lowering medications should be carefully monitored for the emergency of myositis or liver disease.\n\nConclusion\n\nHyperlipidemia is a common pathology that is widely diagnosed nowadays. There are many risk factors, such as an unhealthy lifestyle or a genetic predisposition to this disease. Proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyles are the main conditions for successful treatment and effective prevention of high cholesterol in particular and hyperlipidemia in general. Furthermore, there are many medications of several drug classes, which proved to be effective in the treatment of hyperlipidemia.\n\nReferences\n\nSaely, C. H., Saely, R. R., & Drexel, H. (2017).

      "Leadership Development in a Multinational Firm Essay\n\nEffective human resources management is one of the premises for the success of any company. Global firms have acknowledged the value of talent development that is regarded as the central factor contributing to the sustainable evolvement of the organization (Sosik and Jung 176). Multinationals have extensive resources to create and implement numerous leadership development initiative, but many of these programs fail due to various reasons. It is necessary to consider some of the most successful incentives in order to understand the elements of efficient leadership development program.\n\nIt is possible to start with a brief note concerning leadership development initiatives at GE. This company is legendary in terms of its talent development and retention (Sosik and Jung 176). One of the reasons behind this success is the fact that the organization made staff development its priority or even “a way of life” (Sosik and Jung 176). GE’s numerous incentives involve the involvement of senior leadership, the provision of feedback, mentoring and support, as well as collaboration and the alignment of organizational goals and leadership development. A brief review of the existing literature shows that these are all elements of successful talent development.\n\nStrategic orientation and goals alignment are seen as the key components of a successful leadership development program (Davis 108). Salicru et al. note that Wärtsilä, a European company, has managed to achieve its high position in the marine and energy markets due to their adoption of an effective talent development program (13). This program called LEAD is characterized by the alignment of the initiative with organizational goals (Salicru et al. 13). Trainees should acquire leadership skills that will be successful in certain contexts and within the boundaries of specific norms and objectives. Other elements of effective leadership development incentives include a careful selection of candidates, proper preparation and assessment, as well as coaching and mentoring (Salicru et al. 16). Of course, the balance of these components is the key to the successful implementation of any initiative.\n\nThe involvement of senior leadership is also an essential element of talent development. Davis stresses that executives should share their experience and show their interest in their employees’ performance, success, and concerns (110). GE’s top management is involved in the process of leadership development, which translates into trainees’ compliance with the program’s major aspects (Sosik and Jung 177). Another important aspect is the provision of feedback, which is closely related to senior management engagement (Davis 110). One of the unsuccessful leadership development programs contributed to the loss of experienced and creative leaders in Hewlett-Packard (Sosik and Jung 135). One of the leaders participating in a program aimed at developing leadership skills found no feedback from senior managers, the lack of effective leaders was one of the reasons for the company’s failures and losses.\n\nThe focus on the aspects mentioned above can ensure multinationals’ success and effective leadership. As has been mentioned above, all these components should be properly balanced and aligned with the firm’s strategic goals. Other recommendations include the use of various training methods and platforms. For example, reflective learning has proved to be an effective training strategy (Salicru et al. 16). Journaling helps trainees grasp the necessary information and contemplate the ways it can improve their leadership skills. Networking is regarded as another valuable instrument associated with talent development. Leaders share experience and knowledge, they receive support and feedback, and they also develop social ties that have a positive impact on their motivation and performance. The use of technology is also an important factor as computer-based communication facilitates learning and information sharing. It is also critical to consider cultural issues as diversity is one of the major peculiarities of multinationals. Therefore, people’s expectations and needs differ across cultures, which can have an impact on initiatives’ outcomes.\n\nOn balance, it is possible to state that effective leadership development initiatives are characterized by a balance of several components. These elements include senior management involvement, feedback provision, proper candidate selection, coaching and mentoring, careful preparation of programs, and appropriate assessment. The use of technology and networking, as well as reflective learning, are valuable recommendations as many organizations pay little attention to these areas. Finally, the cultural difference of the people involved in the training process should also be taken into account when preparing talent developing incentives.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDavis, Paul J. “Best Practice Principles in Leadership Development Interventions: An Australian Perspective.” Journal of Management Policy and Practice, vol. 15, no. 5, 2014, pp. 107-119.\n\nSalicru, Sebastian, et al. “A Case Study of Global Leadership Development Best Practice.” OD Practitioner, vol. 48, no. 2, 2016, pp. 12-20.\n\nSosik, John J., and Dongil Jung.

      "“Modern Times” the Movie by Charlie Chaplin Essay (Movie Review)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Genre Analysis\n 3. Rationale\n 4. Examples\n 5. Application\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen seeking a movie that is emblematic of comedy as a genre, one would inevitably mention a film directed by Chaplin, the Modern Times released in 1936 being the most common example. Modern Times was released and distributed by the United Artists Corporation, Chaplin being the main star of the film and impersonating an employee working at an assembly line (“Modern Times” par. 1). Although the film did not belong to any particular movement, it set the standard for slapstick comedy and, therefore, should be seen as a crucial art piece.\n\nThe plot of Modern Times is surprisingly complex for a comedy. The presence of numerous details and themes elevates the genre and the film to a new level, thus wetting the standards that other movies would try to achieve and supersede in the future. Modern Times starts with the lead character being employed as an assembly line worker. The lead character quickly loses track of his responsibilities and introduces confusion and havoc to his workplace (“Modern Times 1936”).\n\nAfter being imprisoned and then placed in a hospital, he asks to be put in jail again, but with little success. Soon he comes across a little orphan, Ellen, who stole a loaf of bread. The Little Tramp assumes the responsibility for the theft, but a casual witness prevents him from doing so. Afterward, he rescues Ellen from imprisonment and is hired at a department store, where he meets three burglars (“Modern Times – Overview” par. 2).\n\nThey face numerous challenges as they try to find jobs and escape the police. After a moment of hesitating whether their efforts are worth anything, the Little Tramp and Ellen decide to start their lives anew, which their walk down the road at dawn symbolizes ( Modern Times ). Being a comedy and one of the pioneers of the genre, Modern Times might be seen merely as a combination of physical humor and an absurd premise, yet it also reflects socioeconomic anxieties of the time, thus becoming extraordinarily relatable to its viewers.\n\nGenre Analysis\n\nThe tendency to see “Modern Times” as a staple of the comedy is a rather telling, albeit somewhat subjective, justification for defining the genre of the movie. On the one hand, Modern Times meets the criteria of both Bergson’s and Freud’s definition by representing “something formal under attack by something informal” (Bishop 23). Indeed, in “Modern Times,” Little Tramp challenges the status quo by bringing chaos to the factory, which, on a superficial level, can be viewed as the main source of comedy.\n\nOn the other hand, the underlying anxiety about the industrial revolution and its possible effects on economic and social issues, such as employment and dependency on automated technology, also becomes the emotional core of the movie (Fawell 21). Thus, “Modern Times” not only establishes the idea of comedy but also expands it, implying that it should not be restricted by its own rules. As a result, the dramatic nature of “Modern Times” also becomes apparent to viewers.\n\nThe presence of profound social, economic, and philosophical contemplations in the movie raises the question of whether Modern Times qualifies as a silent comedy or whether it should be seen as an example of silent drama. However, since the film has already been defined as comedic by the sources that have unquestionably high authority, one may instead posit where the boundary between comedy and drama lies. Indeed, the frames of comedy as a genre have been expanding over the decades of its evolution, incorporating new elements and ideas. For instance, Gies and Wall argue that comedy should have “socioeconomic valence” that challenges the audience and encourages social progress (6). Therefore, the genre of silent comedy, to which the movie belongs, is characterized by high levels of complexity.\n\nRationale\n\nThe movie incorporates a range of techniques that allow it to stand out from the rest of the comedies. Specifically, one needs to mention the use of lighting and music as the elements that contribute to the creation of a humorous scenario. Similarly, the editing in the movie is quite impressive. The timing is perfect, with each punch line being delivered exactly at the moment when it is needed. As a result, Modern Times makes very efficient use of visual humor.\n\nExamples\n\nModern Times warrants the title of a comedy primarily for the innovative use of physical humor and the creation of scenarios that are deemed as absurd to a viewer. For instance, the very idea that a factory worker would start a fight with a machine, let alone a rampage at the workplace, is unbelievable enough to make audiences laugh. The mise-en-scène involving the lead character’s outburst of anger at the factory is particularly worthy of attention as an example of stellar comedy.\n\nIn the specified scene, the comedic timing, the frontal space, and wide-key lighting also help juxtapose the well-functioning mechanism of the factory with the extraordinary behavior of the character. These components allow taking the level of absurdity in the movie to the maximum (Austerlitz 13). Arguably, these elements help make the scene both comedic and tragic due to the social context that it conveys.\n\nThe movie should also be credited for the excellent performance of every actor. The lead character steals the entire film whenever he appears on the screen. However, the rest of the cast also creates the required impression. Thus, they allow the audience to experience the movie fully. As the viewers see the exchange between Little Tramp and the burglar, they notice a combination of genuineness and absurdity of the situation (Flom 103). As a result, the scene makes viewers laugh due to the comic effect. Thus, with a cadence of perfectly natural and just as surreal scenes, Modern Times provides a unique experience. The actors perform masterfully, representing their characters naturally. Their every move elicits an emotional response from viewers.\n\nNonetheless, Modern Times does not fully meet the criteria for silent comedy by extending it and pushing the envelope regarding themes, and introducing a profound social commentary on the technological progress and its effects. While the specified aspect of the movie’s characteristics cannot technically be seen as a flaw, it does not allow viewing Modern Times solely as a comedic film intended to make the audiences laugh.\n\nTherefore, Modern Times needs to be recognized as the film that challenged the audience’s perception of comedy. Little Tramp elevated the idea of comedy to the point where it elicited mixed emotions and made the lead character not only funny but also sympathetic and identifiable. As a result, the main character became relatable enough for the viewer to sympathize with his cause, which is ultimately the plight of the labor force to retain their employment. At the same time, Modern Times stayed amusing enough to be comedic.\n\nApplication\n\nLittle Tramp is one of those movies every scene in which could be framed as a masterful picture. However, the scene that cements the key idea of the movie occurs at the very end. As Little Tramp and Ellen stand up, take each other by the hand, and start a new journey, the key philosophical theme of the film is revealed.\n\nConclusion\n\nLittle Tramp was one of the pioneers of comedy as a genre. It introduced its audience to the concept of silent comedy, combining social commentaries with visual and physical humor. Furthermore, the movie featured very compelling characters to whom audiences could relate. As a result, Little Tramp entered the pantheon of world-renowned movies that changed the landscape of cinema. Challenging and thought-provoking, the movie questioned the social issues of the time. Nevertheless, ti remains relatable due to its timeless characters and unforgettable humor.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAusterlitz, Saul. Another Fine Mess: A History of American Film Comedy .

Steps I plan to take (or have taken)\n 4. Some challenges to my plan\n 5. Strength of my plan\n\nThe Change I want to (or have made) is\n\nI want to improve my diet and eat two servings of vegetables every day.\n\nThe reasons why I want to make the change\n\nA healthy diet is the foundation of well-being. People often eat processed food as they do not have time to cook their meals. Increasing the amount of vegetables in one’s diet improves the vitamin intake, strengthens teeth, and positively affects the bowel movement.\n\nSteps I plan to take (or have taken)\n\n  * Make a list of vegetables to buy during the next trip to the grocery store or market.\n  * Purchase fresh vegetables and prepare meals ahead of time.\n  * Remember to eat healthily for a month in order to create a habit and reinforce it with repetitive activities.\n  * Continue to add more healthy ingredients to my diet and avoid purchasing processed foods.\n\nHow others can help me?\n\nIt is possible to ask my friends to participate in my change and encourage them to take the same steps as I do. Cooking and eating together creates a better environment for relapse prevention as group encouragement helps one to maintain new patterns of behavior. Moreover, I can ask my friends to spend time in places that do not serve unhealthy meals. This action may support my change and prevent me from reverting to an unhealthy diet.\n\nSome challenges to my plan\n\n  * Adding more vegetables to my diet on a regular basis may be hard as it takes much time to buy all necessary ingredients and prepare meals.\n  * Cooking the same meals during an extended period of time may become exhausting and prompt me to choose less healthy options.\n\nStrength of my plan\n\n  * Well-prepared meals may encourage me to continue implementing the change.\n  * This program is not restricting or complicated in any way.\n\nWhat I will do if my plan isn’t (hasn’t worked)?\n\nChanging the plan to make it less complicated or adding days when I do not need to cook may help me to adjust faster. Moreover, I can ask for help from others in order to reassure me and help me to start again. The need for self-reevaluation is necessary even in the case of small changes.\n",
      "“Is True Friendship Dying Away?” and “The Price We Pay” Essay\n\n“Is True Friendship Dying Away?” By Mark Vernon\n\nMark Vernon is a renowned English writer as well as a journalist. He is also the author of the article “Is True Friendship Dying Away?” which philosophically questions the existence of true friendship in the twenty-first century. Then Purpose of the essay is to depict the way social media such as Facebook and Twitter have influenced the lifestyles of every person in the world. The story has shown the way true friendship has been eroded by the technological advancements that have disabled the face to face communication that was helpful for bonding in society.\n\nThe tone may encompass the use of words and the way they are arranged it could also include the use of vivid appeals and comparative language such as metaphors. Tone helps to depict emotions as well as feelings, which convey the mood of a given composition. It includes attitudes in relation to the composition, which could be formal or ironic and helps to depict the author’s feelings regarding the subject. Mark Vernon ironically questions, whether the true friendship will last since individuals all over the world, have opted to communicate through social networking sites rather than facing each other.\n\nEven close friends prefer the sites, which not only make the society lonely but also as Vernon states, “entering a period of crisis for the entire concept of friendship” (pr.2). He observes that many Americans have no friends and the author remains critical about the issue that has cropped from the technological advancements in the twenty-first century. The so-called friends have no life to share as a result of the social pressures that have continued to reduce cohesiveness in society.\n\nThe author applies the use of vocabularies and has a distinct style in his composition, which includes ‘neologism’ to portray the extent of shallowness or emptiness of online friendships. He socially applies formal and informal words to depict active and introspective traits through the usage of specific verbs. This has helped to come up with the proper composition and confer a certain mood through a selection of peculiar phrases. Vernon utilizes phrases such as ‘electronic stimuli’ ‘online world’ ‘connection may only be a click away’ to depict the manner in which technology has triggered a response to eroding the actual human contact and ultimately result in a lonely society (pr.2).\n\n“The Price We Pay” by Adam Mayblum\n\nAdam Mayblum was an eyewitness to the September eleventh, 2001 attack on the World Trade Centre and therefore, he dedicated his article “The Price We Pay” in memory of that fateful event. The price we pay is based on a real-life encounter of the collapse of the twin towers on September 11. The purpose of their story is to portray the difficulties that the residents of the world trade center had to go through. For the survivors, it was a struggle for survival that was marked by many hardships, and for the ones who perished, they remain a heart-stopping memory that left the whole nation united. The author who was on the 87 th floor helped others to survive, which strongly depicts American unity as well as democracy.\n\nThe author maintains a positive tone that implies that even when the enemies pursued to destroy the Americans, they remained united and this was essential to keep them going. The fateful event saw the perishing of his several friends who worked in the twin towers and this impacted his life. Irrespective of the te r rorist act, which meant to chatter the U.S, it left them even more united and this is what the author recognizes as American nationalism.\n\nThe overall tone of the composition is a sad one as the author feels terrible. For instance, as they were going downstairs, the rescue team was going up while he alerted them of the people they had left behind, only to face their death. The overall tone of the story can be summarized by the statement in which Mayblum maintains that “Ordinary people were heroes too” (pr.16). This tone helps to depict Mayblum’s emotions as well as his feelings, which conveys the overall mood of the story.\n\nFrom the article, the author has a strong sense of diction as he is able to apply the usage of certain phrases and words to drive his point home. For instance, “My name is Adam Mayblum. I am alive today. I am committing this to paper; so I never forget. SO WE NEVER FORGET” (pr.1) is a statement that is unique to the author. Whenever the events of the fateful day are remembered, this phrase goes along with it. He also compares the shaking of the North Tower with the shaking as a result of an earthquake and its ultimate collapse. He also compares the scattering of paper reams to a ‘ticker tape parade’. Besides, the author compares the enormous room that was smoky but not dark, to be one ‘under construction’. In such a frustrating moment, the author and his team could still afford to make some jokes.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nVernon, Mark. “Is True Friendship Dying Away?.” USA Today n.d.: Academic Search Premier .

      "Personal Worldview and Intercultural Communication Essay\n\nWorldview refers to how an individual perceives the world (Hesselgrave, 2012). Most people develop Worldviews unconsciously as they grow up. When I read ‘What is a Christian Worldview,’ (“Gotuestions,” n.d), I responded to questions from a Christian point of view, and it just came naturally that I responded in a Christian manner; thus, it is evident that my conception of the world is from a Christian standpoint. The questions in ‘What is a Christian Worldview’ are; “where did we come from?”, “What is wrong with the world?” and “how can we fix it?” My immediate responses were; “God created us, to govern the world and fellowship with Him.” (Rogers, 2005; Gen1:27-28 New International Versions).\n\nThe verse continues to argue that Adam and Eve subjected the whole universe to punishment because they sinned against Him. “We can fix it by living according to His word since He redeemed the world through the sacrifice of His Son Jesus Christ” (Gen 3:15 New International Version) respectively. Therefore, my initial response clearly showed that I view the world from a Christian Worldview, and I am proud of it.\n\nI think my Worldview has affected my intercultural communication in a negative way. Since I believe that living according to the word is the only right thing to do, I tend to disregard other people’s cultures because, in my view, my culture is right and other people’s cultures are wrong. I fail to recognize the various aspects of other people’s worldviews; thus, I cannot be able to respect other people’s worldviews. Holding on to my Worldview can hinder intercultural communication because I cannot open up to people who have different worldviews from mine. It would be difficult for them to relate with me for fear that I will judge them; as a result, intercultural communication is impossible.\n\nI did two Implicit Preference Tests on religion and sexuality (“Test Bias,” n.d). On the religion part, I was tested on my feelings towards Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism. I found out that I have a healthy negative attitude towards other religions besides Christianity. In sexuality test, it was about my attitude towards straight and gay people. Results show that I dislike gay people as it is against my Christian values. In the folk tale of the ‘Blind Men and the Elephant’ (“Neogenesis,” n.d), each blind man had a feel of an elephant and created images in their minds of how an elephant looks like.\n\nEach tried to convince the other that they were right, but in the real case, they were all wrong. In connection to this folk tale, I have learned that though I lean on the Christian worldview, I should not judge other people’s worldviews because we are all different. I should not be ethnocentric, which means thinking other cultures solely by the values of one’s own culture. If I do so, then the opportunity of getting to know and appreciate other people’s worldviews cultures would pass me. It is not advisable to beg ignorant of different cultures as one can miss many opportunities (Bridger, 2013).\n\nA stereotype is a generalization about a person and originates when one is unwilling to obtain all the information needed to make a fair judgment about other people, and Prejudice refers to a baseless and usually negative attitude toward members of a group (Carson, 2002). Therefore, if one is ethnocentric, the chances of stereotyping and prejudicing other cultures over worldviews are very high. Consequently, I have also learned to understand and respect others’ ethnocentric attitudes whilst minimizing my own ethnocentrism to communicate effectively intercultural.\n\nIn conclusion, everybody has his or her own worldview. Worldviews are different and unique; thus, no one should claim that his or her Worldview is superior to another’s. We should learn to understand, tolerate, respect, and accept each other’s worldviews to be able to communicate effectively in an intercultural setting.\n\nReferences\n\nBridger, J. S. (2013).

      "Mathematical Physics: Fourier Representation of Images Essay\n\nFourier representation of images\n\nOBJECTIVE: this lab comes up with the Fourier representation of images in one and two dimensions. The signal of the image takes the form of a sinusoidal wave. The amplitude and the frequency were of the wave were changed to observe what effects they have on the Fourier transform together with the amplitude histogram.\n\nOne-dimensional Signals\n\nExercise 1 & 2\n\nFig. 1: The one-dimensional image of a signal with a frequency of 1 (left) and the corresponding amplitude spectrum (right).\n\nFig. 2: The one-dimensional image of a signal with a frequency of 2.5 (left) and the corresponding amplitude spectrum (right).\n\nFig. 3: The one-dimensional image of a signal with a frequency of 5 (left) and the corresponding amplitude spectrum (right)\n\nThe above figures show sinusoidal waves of a signal at the frequencies of 5, 2.5, and 1. The corresponding spectra of amplitudes show the connection between increased amplitude and values resulting from an application of a Fourier transform. An increase in the frequency of the sinusoid leads to an increase in the number of cycles on the scale of 0 to 1. The spectrum of the amplitude has two peaks. One of the peaks is negative while the other is positive. The diagrams have shown that the frequency determines the position of the peak amplitudes. For example, if the frequency of the signal is 1, the amplitude spectrum has peaked at 1 and -1. An increase in the frequency leads to a separation of the peaks from each other. Thus, the distance between the peaks is increased.\n\nFig. 4: The one-dimensional image of a signal with a frequency of 2.5 and an amplitude of 10 (left), next to the image is the amplitude spectrum.\n\nFig. 5: A one-dimensional image of a signal with a frequency of 2.5 and amplitude of 20, with the amplitude spectrum, is at its right.\n\nFig. 6: A one-dimensional image of a signal with a frequency of 2.5 and amplitude of 50, together with its amplitude spectrum on the right.\n\nThe figures shown above are one-dimensional images of a signal that has a consistent frequency of 2.5 but with different amplitudes. The plot of the sinusoid wave shows that the amplitude of the wave increases in the vertical axis. The amplitude spectrum for the wave shows that the position of the peak along the horizontal axis remains the same because the determinant factor is the frequency of the wave. However, the magnitude of the signal at that particular value increases proportionally with amplitude.\n\nExercise 3\n\nFig. 7: This image shows two one-dimensional sinusoidal waves, each of which has a frequency of one. The two sinusoids have amplitudes of 10 each. The amplitude spectrum corresponding to the sinusoid is to the right of the wave.\n\nFrom the images, it is evident that if sinusoids have the same frequency, their amplitudes are additive. In the case of the amplitude of 10 for each of the sinusoids, the resultant wave has an amplitude of 20. The frequency remains unchanged. This is termed as constructive signal interference.\n\nFig. 8: This figure shows the addition of sinusoidal waves of the same amplitude (10) and frequencies of 1 and 2.5 to form a resultant wave. The amplitude spectrum associated with the waves is to the right.\n\nFig. 9: This figure shows the addition of sinusoidal waves of the same amplitude (10) and frequencies of 1 and 5 to form a resultant wave. The amplitude spectrum associated with the waves is to the right.\n\nFig. 10: This figure shows the addition of sinusoidal waves of the same amplitude (10) and frequencies of 1 and 9 to form a resultant wave. The amplitude spectrum associated with the waves is to the right.\n\nThe images shown above indicate that two sinusoid signals with different frequencies combine to have an amplitude spectrum that has two peaks (positive and negative). These two peaks are at the given frequencies. For instance, when sinusoids with frequencies 1 and 9 combine the amplitude peaks will be positioned at -9, -1, 1, and 9. As discussed in the previous text, the amplitudes only become additive when the combining waves are of the same frequency.\n\nExercise 4\n\nFig. 11: Two-dimensional signal that has equal frequencies of 1, shown on the left, and the corresponding Fourier transform shown on the right.\n\nFrom the figure above, the image is from a wave of low frequency. This is because the red dots from the Fourier transform approach the origin, (0, 0). In the image, two dots are evident in the horizontal direction and two similar dots in the vertical direction, separated by equal distances. This is because the two signals have similar but perpendicular frequencies.\n\nFig. 12: On the left are images of a combination of signals with the frequencies 1 and 7. In the bottom left image, the signal directions are inverted. The images on the right are the corresponding Fourier transforms.\n\nThe images shown above depict the impact that different frequencies have on the signal waves. High frequency, 7, lines are shown in white, while their low frequency, 1, counterparts are shown in dark grey. The Fourier transform that results from the signal image indicates that the represented frequencies are mainly parallel to the signal direction. For instance, if an image has vertical stripes, then the signal will also be vertical. This is because the dominant frequency, in this case, 7, is parallel to the y-axis. In each of the Fourier transform, the red dots are seen to be away from the origin, (0, 0). This is because the images have a higher frequency, unlike the images in fig. 11.\n\nFig. 13: The image on the left is from a combination of two signals with frequencies of 9.9 each. To the right of this image is the corresponding Fourier transform.\n\nFrom the figure shown above, a two-dimensional image that has perpendicular signals results in a Fourier transform that has four dots, with equal distances between any two dots, and away from the origin, (0, 0). This is an indication of similar and perpendicular frequencies.\n",

      "Apple Inc.’s Macroenvironmental Analysis Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. PEST Analysis\n 3. Uncertainty\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nApple is among the globally renowned organizations. It has continued to record remarkable performance levels, thanks to the company’s capacity to efficiently manage external forces available in its macro-environment. Apple’s leader, Tim Cook, has steered efforts to implement approaches that have helped this company to identify prospective ideas while at the same time securing it from potential risks. Conducting a PEST analysis can reveal key external elements that business managers may need to incorporate when implementing strategies for managing the prevailing macro-environment. The issue of uncertainty is also presented as good for business.\n\nPEST Analysis\n\nApple operates in an environment dominated by politics. However, the available political factors are beneficial to this company. For instance, the current free trade policies and the friendly political atmosphere in industrialized states have favored its global operations (Liu 2017). Regarding external economic forces, Apple enjoys the high pace of growth among emerging economies that are expected to boost its clientele base. It also benefits from operating in stable industrialized nations such as the U.S and Singapore (Liu 2017). The prevailing socio-cultural atmosphere presents an opportunity for this organization. Presently, the number of people who deploy cell phones, iPhones, and iPads is increasing. In addition, the need for joining Internet-facilitated social media platforms has pushed customers to seek the company’s digital gadgets. Regarding technology as an external force, Apple operates in an environment that is currently marked by increasing demand for cloud-computing services in many companies. Moreover, this organization stands to gain from the booming apps business.\n\nPEST analysis is vital for business administrators, especially those who operate in the technology sector. In particular, business managers rely on it to understand various changes that are being witnessed in various markets. Such forces may operate against a company by interfering with its prevailing business networks or promotion techniques. Hence, organizational administrators can deploy findings from PEST analysis to implement the most appropriate decisions before such counterproductive issues happen.\n\nUncertainty\n\nMany businesses plan ahead of time by developing strategies that can help them to deal with any uncertainties. According to Antonczyk and Salzmann (2014), such efforts indicate the extent to which they view uncertainties as counterproductive to their day-to-day operations. Specifically, companies that embrace this perception argue that the improbability of the future has the potential of interrupting their valuations (Antonczyk & Salzmann 2014). However, scholars such as Browne (2017) present a different perspective whereby some organizations, including Wolters Kluwer, regard uncertainty as to good for business.\n\nI agree with this perspective because this company’s CFO captures the client as the most important resource that a business can have. While organizations that share a contrary opinion focus more on the impact of uncertainty on their assets, they fail to realize that without customers, such wealth would be nowhere. In fact, the study by Senn, Thoma, and Yip (2013) supports the CFO’s viewpoints by depicting clients as valuable possessions. In my opinion, preparing customers to deal with an uncertain future is a crucial step that not only safeguards their loyalty to particular companies but also saves them from making inappropriate financial decisions. Hence, uncertainty becomes an essential business element when viewed from the perspective of clients.\n\nConclusion\n\nBusinesses that wish to remain operational in the present-day competitive environment deploy tools such as PEST analysis to find out forces that may be acting against them. This tool is important for managers because it helps in proper decision-making, especially regarding ways of managing potential threats. The issue of uncertainty is viewed from diverse viewpoints. While some companies regard it as counterproductive, I agree with the CFO of Wolters Kluwer when he depicts this aspect as good for business. In my opinion, failing to prepare customers to face difficulties brought by the uncertain future may compromise their loyalty to particular companies and, consequently, profitability.\n\nReference List\n\nAntonczyk, R & Salzmann, A 2014, ‘Corporate governance, risk aversion and firm value’, Applied Financial Economics, vol. 24, no. 8, pp. 543-556, Web.\n\nBrowne, R 2017, ‘Uncertainty is good for business, says Wolters Kluwer CFO’ , CNBC, Web.\n\nLiu, G 2017, ‘International business analysis empowered with research’, Online Searcher, vol. 41, no. 5, pp. 42-46, Web.\n\nSenn, C, Thoma, A & Yip, G 2013, ‘Customer-centric leadership: how to manage strategic customers as assets in B2B markets’, California Management Review, vol. 55, no. 3, pp. 27-59, Web.\n",
      "Virtual Reality in Healthcare Training Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Research Questions and Project Parameters\n 3. Research Framework\n 4. Research Design\n 5. Ethical Considerations\n 6. Literature Review\n 7. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nLearning health-associated subjects throughout medical and nursing professional training implies the research and comprehension of a large body of materials and the acquisition of multiple skills and competencies. To improve the learning experience and outcomes, educators and healthcare leaders have strived to integrate new technologies into the curriculum and staff education programs. One of them is the virtual reality (VR) technology, which provides opportunities for simulation training and quick acquisition of anatomical knowledge, as well as psychomotor skills. Overall, the use of VR in the healthcare sector holds both a great promise and multiple challenges. Thus, the present research project will aim to explore them.\n\nResearch Questions and Project Parameters\n\nRecent research evidence makes it clear that the VR technology can help healthcare practitioners develop and retain expertise before engaging in practice and, as a result, reduce the chance of error in such technically demanding medial fields as neurosurgery and others (Siu et al., 2016; Suri, Patra, & Meena, 2016). Based on this, the main research question is as follows: what are the benefits of using VR in the healthcare sector? Additionally, it is hypothesised that various organisational factors defining the manner VR is implemented may substantially determine the overall training outcomes. Thus, the second research question is as follows: what are the barriers to effective use of VR in the healthcare sector?\n\nTo answer the formulated questions, the data will be collected from at least thirty participants included in trainee and trainer groups that will complete the VR competency curriculum. The objective data will be gathered to inform the exploration of the first question, and it will focus on such performance measures as time, volume, and efficiency of task completion; the number of errors pre- and post-training, and so forth. The subjective data will be gathered to evaluate participants’ perceptions regarding the utility of VR, as well as organisational facilitators and obstacles to its application. The expected timeframe for project completion is eight months.\n\nResearch Framework\n\nThe philosophical basis for the present research project is the critical realism theory. According to Saunders, Lewis, and Thornhill (2015), critical realism implies that individuals’ knowledge about reality is a result of environmental and social conditioning and, therefore, it cannot be comprehended without exploring the forces involved in the knowledge formation process. Based on this, the research project is intended as a multi-level study aimed to investigate individual, group, and organisational factors.\n\nAdditionally, the study will employ the deduction approach aimed to test the proposed theory-based hypotheses. This method will allow finding casual relationships among such variables as VR training completion and practitioners’ skilfulness, organisational barriers and training effectiveness, and so forth.\n\nResearch Design\n\nThe sequential, exploratory, quantitative design will be utilised in the research project. It will take the form of an experiment because the participants will undergo an intervention (namely, engagement in VR training) yet their outcomes will not be compared with a control group. The study will also include a longitudinal element because its objective is to elucidate a change in trainees’ skills over a certain period.\n\nTo collect data, participants’ performance records will be used along with Likert-type questionnaires aimed to capture their perceptions of the intervention and its efficacy. Consequently, the data will be analysed by using both descriptive and inferential statistics tools, including median values for each research construct and regression analysis of variables.\n\nEthical Considerations\n\nTo ensure the ethical integrity of the study, participants will be asked to sign an informed consent form. It will briefly state the nature and purposes of research and describe procedures to which respondents will be exposed. Additionally, to minimise the chance of harm to participants’ identity, the researcher will ensure data confidentiality and anonymity during the disclosure of results. Lastly, the research integrity will be maintained through ethical utilisation of previous findings and appropriate crediting of scholars and scientists whose studies will be referred to during the literature review.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nThe search for evidence on the topic of interest was conducted through such databases as EBSCO/Academic Search Complete, Science Direct, and Medline/Pubmed. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were selected because they were deemed similarly helpful in guiding the research process and supporting the findings. The inclusion criteria were the publication year (2013-2018), the relevance of the topic of VR healthcare training, and the depth of the conducted analysis.\n\nThe chosen studies revealed that VR is more frequently used in surgical training (Siu et al., 2016; Arora et al., 2015; Suri et al., 2016; Bharathan et al., 2016). The main reason for this is the safety and educational challenges associated with performing surgeries by novice practitioners (Bharathan et al., 2016). However, VR can also be implemented for the improvement of non-surgical procedural skills in many medical fields, including cardiology (Biswas et al., 2016; Voelker et al., 2016), gastroenterology (Khan et al., 2018), and others.\n\nMany of the empirical studies demonstrated that the use of VR leads to favourable training outcomes. For example, Voelker et al. (2016) reported a significant improvement in the mean skills score of participants who completed the VR simulation course regardless of an increase in the complexity of the simulated task. Notably, the control group in their study showed a decrease in the mean skills score over time (Voelker et al., 2016).\n\nBharathan et al. (2013) also revealed that, after ten VR sessions, participants’ dexterity level significantly increased, and it led to a decrease in cognitive load. Similarly, Arora et al. (2015) and Biswas et al. (2016) noted that the completion of VR training programs was associated with a decrease in learning curves due to development of greater experience in trainees. As a result, it becomes possible to reduce time while performing procedures on real patients. Additionally, Siu et al. (2016) noted that because of the potential positive effects of VR technologies on practitioners’ proficiency level, not only can they be useful for developing skills in novice practitioners but also for maintaining skills in the experienced ones.\n\nThe findings provided in the located studies make it clear that the success of VR training programs is dependent on various factors. Arora et al. (2014) stated that the ability of repetitive practice and the possibility for modification of task difficulty levels during simulation were linked to better learning outcomes.\n\nKhan et al. (2018) made a similar observation by claiming that “a progressive‐learning curriculum that sequentially increases task difficulty provides benefit with respect to a composite score of competency over the structured VR training curriculum” (p. 3). Along with appropriate training constructs, there must be a supportive learning environment in a setting. For instance, Flower (2015) mentioned that an ongoing dialogue with an experienced teacher allows optimising learning experience and maximising favourable outcomes.\n\nIt is observed that in spite of a plethora of potentially positive effects of VR, it has some significant deficiencies. Suri et al. (2016) noted that “none of the simulators has proven to be totally immersive to provide a perfect virtual environment” and often the skills acquired by using VR training may not replicate real-life situations (p. 393). Biswas et al. (2016) also stated that this learning tool fails to help practitioners deal with complex situations involving various psycho-emotional and physiological factors such as patients’ emotional unrest, soft tissue peculiarities, and so forth. These challenges must be considered while designing a VR curriculum to improve learning experiences and outcomes.\n\nReferences\n\nArora, A., Hall, A., Kotecha, J., Burgess, C., Khemani, S., Darzi, A.,… Tolley, N.

      "Communicative Language Teaching and Perceptions Research Paper\n\nReviewing the research related to teacher perception of CLT provides insight into teachers’ decisions and instructional practices, while also helping to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying thoughts that influence the level of CLT implementation in classrooms across the globe. This study seeks to discern trends in teacher perceptions and detect gaps in CLT implementation. Studying teachers’ perceptions will help reveal, at least in part, the complexity of teachers’ cognition, intuition, conceptions, and beliefs due to the role of “teachers’ mental lives” in their practice (Yunus, Salehi, & Amini, 2016, p. 21).\n\nAccording to Solis (2015), a belief is a theoretical part of knowledge that is “not founded on rationality but on feelings and experiences,” and is a basis for people to interpret facts and guide their further learning (p. 247-248). This study views teacher beliefs as crucial elements for determining teachers’ positive or negative perceptions towards CLT, which has implications for CLT implementation in their classrooms.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that many teachers have a favorable perception of CLT (Mondal, 2012, Lashgari, Jamali, & Yousofi, 2014). For instance, the study by Mondal (2012) aimed at examining EFL teachers attitudes and perception toward CLT. The researcher observed that Bangladeshi college instructors held favorable opinions of CLT principles as the educators believed CLT made teaching English more meaningful, particularly in comparison to ensuring that students memorized a plethora of grammatical rules and concepts.\n\nThe instructors thought CLT gave students opportunities to practice using the rules in actual conversations rather than passively attempting to absorb and regurgitate the information outside of a meaningful context. So, they regularly utilized CLT principles in their EFL classroom instruction (Mondal, 2012).\n\nIn Iran, Lashgari, Jamali, and Yousofi (2014) found similar results in that EFL teachers, in general, had positive attitudes toward CLT while also embodying the fundamental aspects of CLT in their beliefs and their actual instructional practices. In fact, the study participants reported that not only were students able to develop a higher level of communicative competence, but students also managed to improve their understanding of grammar concepts through meaningful participation in language-rich activities (Lashgari et al., 2014).\n\nFurthermore, several studies demonstrated that some teachers have a positive perception of the CLT approach while highlighting the benefits of collaborative learning, a specific CLT principle. The teachers reported that group work was important in EFL classes because of the multiple opportunities students had to use the target language in an authentic manner with their peers as they developed more cooperative relationships (Siddiqui & Asif, 2018; Ounis & Ounis, 2017; Jafari, Shokrpour, & Guetterman, 2015).\n\nFor example, Jafari et al. (2015) conducted a mixed method study that explored Iranian English teachers’ perceptions of the CLT approach. In this study, many of teachers who made specific mention of how they found partner and small-group activities to be particularly useful. The sheer number of instances in which students could practice the target language with each other and also with the teacher provided an advantage that was not possible with the more traditional EFL teaching approaches. As teachers were encouraged by the productivity of the student-centered CLT approach, the researchers noted the likelihood that teachers would implement CLT principles in their classrooms (Jafari et al., 2015).\n\nSimilarly, Siddiqui and Asif (2018) found that many English professors at a Saudi university considered group/pair work and communicative activities more favorable to them. They believe that it encourages learners to use the target language and helps to promote real communication. (Siddiqui & Asif, 2018).\n\nOther studies have shown that many teachers believe that CLT is essential for improving both the communication skills and the motivation levels of students in their classrooms (Chang, 2011, Sarab, Monfared, & Safarzadeh, 2016).\n\nChang’s (2011) mixed method study conducted among fifty-five teachers from Taiwanese colleges aimed at investigating EFL teachers’ attitudes toward CLT. The researcher found that the majority of participants indicated their satisfaction with how CLT helps to eliminate the need for students to memorize information and helps mitigate concerns about how students can easily get lost in the multiple grammar rules associated with more traditional instructional approaches. In many ways, the teachers reported that CLT methods are more interesting, which makes learning language more effective and enjoyable, which motivates students to improve their communication skills (Chang, 2011).\n\nLikewise, Sarab, Monfared, and Safarzadeh (2016) reported that the majority of the 75 Iranian secondary school teachers they surveyed understood the importance of the goals for students in CLT classrooms to establish productive and enjoyable communication for cooperation using the target language. The teachers expressed the belief that CLT improves students’ communication skills and increases their enjoyment, which is a motivating factor for learning (Sarab et al., 2016).\n\nThe aforementioned research findings indicate that many EFL teachers display favorable perceptions toward CLT principles, which seem to indicate the teachers’ willingness to shift their practices to a more communicative paradigm. However, a number of studies have also identified teachers’ concerns about CLT, persistent misconceptions about CLT, and misalignment of teaching practices with the principles of CLT.\n\nFor instance, some studies show that some teachers believe in using direct instructional methods and repetitive practice through drills for teaching grammatical rules, which conflicts with the CLT principle of refraining from direct grammar explanations in the CLT classroom (Wong & Marly, 2012; Jabeen, 2014). The purpose of the qualitative case study conducted by Wong & Marly (2012) was to investigate teachers’ perception of CLT and its implementation in the classroom.\n\nAccording to (Wong & Marly, 2012) a group of American professors are steadfast in their belief that grammar instruction is necessary for students to be able to speak and write properly in the target language. While the participants were generally supportive of engaging students in communicative methods, their insistence on explaining grammatical and linguistic concepts to students affected their implementation of CLT principles (Wong & Marly, 2012). Along the same lines, Jabeen (2014) study of secondary teachers in Delhi showed how a significant proportion of the participants emphasized the importance of teaching grammar rules directly.\n\nThe teachers noticed that group work was effective in fostering learners’ autonomy; however, they believed that such activities were highly time-consuming and imposed difficulty to control and monitor all students. Therefore, many teachers reported they preferred individual work, which was quieter and more orderly. Their beliefs also affected their implementation of CLT (Jabeen, 2014).\n\nOther studies have revealed concerns related to the CLT principle of error correction. Raissi, Nor, Aziz, Saleh, and Zainal (2013) found that some Malaysian teachers consider CLT principles to be effective in encouraging students to speak in a tourist-oriented environment. Nevertheless, the findings of the study diverged from the principles of CLT concerning error correction because more than half of the participants recognized error correction as an essential stage of language learning. Moreover, over half of the teachers expressed the desire to continue teaching mechanical grammar drills (Raissi et al., 2013). In total, these beliefs affected the teachers’ application of CLT principles in their classrooms.\n\nResearchers have also found that teachers can misunderstand CLT principles, which affects their perceptions and their implementation of the instructional approach (Wong, 2012; Farooq, 2015). According to Wong (2012), the main reason some teachers avoided using CLT practices in their classrooms is that they misunderstood CLT methods. The author concluded teachers’ attitudes about CLT activities vary regarding grammar lectures and practices, communicative activities, and picture descriptions. This investigation makes a clear connection between teachers’ attitudes and their understanding of CLT.\n\nThus, according to Wong (2012), due to the general inexperience and uncertainty of teachers, the implementation of CLT still remains a concern in some colleges (Wong, 2012). Similarly, a recent study by Farooq (2015) explored how teachers in Saudi Arabia perceived CLT. The researcher applied a questionnaire to examine the teachers’ perceptions of ten CLT characteristics. The participants presented different definitions of the concept and emphasized different aspects of CLT, which shows that a lack of consensus, in addition to misunderstandings, can affect classroom implementation (Farooq, 2015).\n\nReferences\n\nSolis, C.

      "Medford University’s Managerial Decisions Essay\n\nOrganization management is a continuous process of influencing the productivity of an employee, group, or organization as a whole for the best results from the standpoint of achieving the goal. Medford University needs to manage means to lead an enterprise to its target, extracting maximum opportunities from all the resources at its disposal. The management process involves concerted action, which ultimately ensures the implementation of a common goal or set of goals facing the organization.\n\nThe input and output of the control part is information; therefore, President Kobayashi appointed a task force to oversee and monitor the problems faced by an organization. The manager is a necessary element of any organization. At this level, decisions are made as a result of the analysis, forecasting, optimization, economic justification, and selection of alternatives from a variety of options to achieve the goal (Chenhall, Hall, & Smith, 2015). The changes are adapted to overcome the problem that has arisen, which is nothing but a real contradiction that needs to be resolved.\n\nThe president should anticipate and expect that every member of the task force will aim at reducing university expenses because Medford University cannot afford continuously spend its resources. President Kobayashi is a leader and head manager, which allows her to consider undertaking involving a collective intelligence of the board. Noting that the management decision is the result of joint creative work and it is always generalized (Chenhall et al., 2015). The managed part is the various products and functional units engaged in supporting the production process. What goes into the input of the regulated element, and what is its output, depends on the type of organization.\n\nThe president appointed the administrator of the hospital as the chair of the task force because the person fully understands the intricacies of regulatory practices. However, the chair delegated crucial tasks for subcommittee ones, and it should not completely dismiss the responsibilities. Modern organizations face many problems, some of which are typical and can be easily solved by specialists by implementing conventional technologies. A set of such problems characterizes the organization as one of the most difficult objects to study and learn.\n\nThe president wants to reserve the right to make necessary modifications and changes because it is important to be able to adjust. A modern enterprise is a complex production system, including such elements as fixed assets, raw materials and supplies, labor, and financial resources (Schoeneborn, Kuhn, & Karreman, 2018). The most important task of management is to use these elements in such a way as to ensure the effective functioning of the entire production system and development in a highly competitive environment.\n\nThe president appointed a key assistant as secretary of the task force because the given person possesses valuable skills and experience in dealing with such matters. Because the work of the enterprise is divided into components, it is carried out by various employees; thus, someone must coordinate and direct efforts. Organizing the work of other people is the essence of management (Schoeneborn et al., 2018). For an enterprise to operate successfully, the managerial job must be separated from unmanaged.\n\nThe leaders of the lower level are junior commanders who are directly above the workers. They organize and monitor the implementation of production tasks and responsible for the direct use of raw materials and equipment. The middle managers coordinate and supervise the work of junior supervisors. All these factors influence the president’s decision-making process in regulating organizational and structural issues.\n\nReferences\n\nChenhall, R. H., Hall, M., & Smith, D. (2015).

R., & Karreman, D. (2018). The communicative constitution of organization, organizing, and organizational. Organization Studies, 40 (4), 475-496.\n\nAnalyzing Managerial Decisions: Bagby Copy Company\n\nTo identify possible alternatives to the decision, the manager must determine the circumstances that impede decision making, which is the primary issue at Bagby Copy Company. The inadequacy of funds, lack of personnel, lack of raw materials, existing laws, etc. are among the general limitations in decision making. A fundamental constraint on all managerial decisions is the narrowing of the powers of various members of the organization. The next step in decision making is the formulation of a set of alternative solutions. As management practice shows, too many alternatives cause only confusion. Therefore, the head looks only part for the best options. This choice is adopted, which conforms to a certain standard.\n\nThe main trade-off of Bagby is efficiency loss and quality reduction. Although specialization allows increasing the product value, it diminishes the management and control across the international market. Standards, are some acceptable number of criteria. When choosing a solution, the manager determines the consequences of the actions (Bryce, Rada, Hecke, & Zissman, 2018). It is also noted that all-important management decisions contain, as a rule, a compromise.\n\nCertain criteria are used to determine the likely consequences of an alternative. The leader tries to give a prediction about the future. A typical example of a correct decision is one in which the problem is solved is correctly assessed, and the alternatives are carefully thought out and weighed (Miller & Martignoni, 2015). Managers seek to choose the most favorable option.\n\nThe major trade-off of dividing wire harness makers into subgroups is communication loss because it increases bureaucracy and reduces coordination. There are possibilities for improving the final product delivery; however, not every problem is simple enough to solve. There are many problems, in connection with which one has to take into account a large number of compromises. In such a situation, none of the possible alternatives would be better; therefore, good experience and common sense of those who make a decision are more applicable (Miller & Martignoni, 2015). Management practice shows that managers do not even dream of making the best decision.\n\nThe process of solving a problem does not boil down to just choosing an alternative. In management practice, managers often assign decision-making to those who will have to implement it. There are also situations where a manager cannot involve other members of the organization in decision making. The procedure for solving a specific management task is in many respects identical to a decision-making procedure.\n\nBagby’s trade-off in selecting country, product, and matrix forms is the quality standard loss, the lack of flexibility, and difficulty adjusting for current trends respectively. Many companies have resorted to the practice of expanding or saturating the duties of their employees, which contributes to an increase in their level of job satisfaction. This practice is more relevant to non-manual employees, compared to manual workers (Bryce et al., 2018). It is much easier to expand employees’ mental or creative labor since they are usually not as clearly defined as changing the content of workers’ physical function, whose tasks can have a high degree of specialization and be precisely defined as part of a more complex integrated production process.\n\nThere may be a conflict between specialization and the development of specific skills necessary for the effective implementation of the production process, and the creation of a model of more expanded or enriched official duties to increase employee satisfaction. In pursuit of an increase in the importance of work, there is a danger of expanding official responsibilities so much that there will be a threat of a significant decrease in labor productivity. The result can be such a curious compromise between work efficiency and level of satisfaction from it when an employee instead of one type of meaningless work begins to perform various kinds of the same meaningless work.\n\nReferences\n\nBryce, J., Rada, G., Hecke, S.

The Enlightenment and the French Revolution\n 5. Napoleon and the Revolution\n 6. The Napoleonic Era\n 7. Conclusion\n 8. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte is still perceived as one of the most influential political figures in history. While many consider his influence on the history of Europe mainly in the light of Napoleonic wars, his role in the French Revolution was nonetheless significant. Although Napoleon was not directly responsible for the unfolding of the Revolution, he had played an instrumental part in bringing the ten-year political struggle to an end. As Lyons notes, the Napoleonic regime was the fulfillment of the French Revolution (295). This essay aims to examine Napoleon’s role in the French Revolution, as well as in its immediate aftermath, by exploring his background, ideology, and actions.\n\nBackground\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte was born into a noble family on the 15th August 1769 on the island of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea (Walsh 71). The place of birth was somewhat essential to the later development of his revolutionary character: “the island, indeed, already enjoyed a somewhat lurid reputation for its fiery individualism, its lack of governability, and the people’s propensity to insurrection and rebellion” (Forrest 17).\n\nViolence was characteristic of the Corsican society of the time, with high rates of murders and other violent crimes (Forrest 17). With the help of his father’s connections, Napoleon was enlisted into a military academy, where he was taught and trained to advance his career in the military (Walsh 71). The difficult political situation in Corsica has largely influenced Napoleon’s interest in studying politics and philosophy (Forrest 35).\n\nThese disciplines were not part of his military training but served to complement it, later giving him an opportunity to turn his military achievements into political advancements. His writings have also distinguished him from the rest of young noblemen: while they were rather keen to express their royalist beliefs and influenced by the Catholic Church, Napoleon’s views were full of humanist sentiment, enlightened persuasion, and anti-clerical prejudice (Forrest 35).\n\nYoung Napoleon argued that the government’s central role was to protect the country’s citizens and actively criticized the clergy for its weakness and indecisiveness (Forrest 36). Napoleon first entered the army as the second lieutenant of artillery at the age of 16, after successfully graduating from the military academy (Walsh 71). The teachers described Napoleon as egoistical and ambitious, which were indeed some of the primary characteristics of his future leadership (Walsh 71).\n\nMilitary Career\n\nNapoleon was highly invested in his career in the French Army from the very beginning, despite the humble pay and far from promising future perspectives: “He was unlikely ever to be a general, since he was a foreign noble and an officer of artillery, which in that day was a technical arm whose officers were not expected to command armies” (Connelly 7). Straight after graduation, Napoleon began his service in the Southern France, at one of the most prestigious artillery units in the Army (Connelly 7). He continued his education in 1788-1789, before the events of the French Revolution became to unfold (Connelly 7).\n\nDuring his studies at Auxonne artillery schools, Napoleon has advanced his knowledge of strategy and tactics and achieved some useful connections in the military, including with General Jean-Pierre du Teil (Connelly 8). Despite the outstanding development, Napoleon stayed in the position of the second lieutenant for six years; it was not until the beginning of the French Revolution that he was able to advance his career in the military (Connelly 9).\n\nConnelly agrees that it was the French Revolution that gave Napoleon a chance to raise in the army ranks, and he seized every opportunity that was offered to him (Connelly 7,9). In an effort to divert the citizen’s attention from the inner turmoil, the government invested much effort and funds in foreign military activities, including wars in Italy and Egypt, which made Napoleon particularly famous.\n\nAnother effect of the Revolution on the Army was the scarcity of officers available: “the Revolution had sent the majority, almost all nobles, flying into exile” (Connelly 9). The lack of successful commander made it possible for Napoleon to get several promotions in a row: after becoming a captain in 1792, he was assigned to defend the French-Italian border, where he begged a civilian commissar Saliceti for the artillery command (Connelly 11).\n\nOnce he received the position of a temporary major, Napoleon started to argue against the other commanders’ strategies and tactics by proposing risky but promising moves to advance the position of the French Army (Connelly 11). It was his willingness to risk, as well as his revolutionary application of tactics, which earned him the position of a brigadier general at the age of twenty-four (Connelly 12). Having served at the Italian frontiers in 1794-1795, Napoleon had extensive knowledge of the enemy forces, which gained him a serious advantage during the First Italian Campaign in the 1796-1797 (Connelly 19).\n\nHis reputation as a strong and reliable leader was partly formed during the campaign in Italy, where he took command of the Army of Italy at Nice on 27 March 1796: “Most accounts emphasize the miracle of leadership by which the twenty-six-year-old prodigy took control of his subordinate generals, all hardened combat veterans and older than he, and set the army moving within days of his arrival” (Connelly 20).\n\nHis leadership success was largely due to the fact that he was seen as invincible due to his past campaigns and he had strong protectors including Barras and Carnot, who were among the most powerful members of the Directory, which is why opposing him was dangerous (Connelly 20). After his famous success in Italy, Napoleon was moved to Egypt and to Syria, where his army has achieved several strategically significant wins (Connelly 55-56). Despite the fact that the Egyptian campaign was far from glorious, upon Napoleon’s return to Paris he was approached by the Revolutionists to lead the coup d’etat, aiming to overthrow the remainders of the government (Connelly 57).\n\nThe Enlightenment and the French Revolution\n\nMany historians and social scientists have agreed that identifying a single cause that led to the French Revolution is not possible; it was an entire collection of ideas and events that laid the foundations for the turmoil that led to the reformation of the French government and society (Marzagalli 19). The Enlightenment has played one of the central roles in shaping the people’s views on the political system and the need for change.\n\nThe ideas promoted by the new philosophical, social, and political theories pointed at the weaknesses of the contemporary government and emphasized the need for reform, as the people began to openly discuss “the moral and political virtues of past and contemporary societies [and] to argue on the consequences of warfare, economic policies, and colonization” (Marzagalli 10). The people were becoming more critical of their government, finding more and more weaknesses in it and arguing for the necessity of governmental changes (Rothenberg 771). The trends of the Enlightenment did not pass by Napoleon, who was skeptical of the contemporary clerical government from a young age.\n\nHis Corsican origin gave him an opportunity to exercise his revolutionary political influence when he returned to the Island shortly after the fall of the Bastille (Forrest 45). As he continued his military career, he understood the potential power of the military in shaping the new nation: “He was a convinced believer in the benefits of meritocracy and applauded the boldness of the revolutionaries in abolishing nobility, selling church lands, and reforming a society rooted in privilege” (Forrest 48).\n\nIn the opposition between the French aristocracy and monarchy, the military gained more power than ever before, a notion that did not escape Napoleon’s attention. While people were growing distrust towards the political leaders, the famous victories of the French military made the army reliable and trustworthy in the eyes of the people, especially in contrast with the weak and indecisive clergy. While quickly rising through the army ranks, Napoleon continued to write letters expressing his criticism of the government and favorable views of the rebels (Forrest 55). Printed images of Napoleon in the heart of the battle were distributed to the masses by the revolutionist forces (Hunt 13).\n\nThe critical role of Napoleon in the French Revolution became evident as it was a combination of his education, views, and military fame that became a solid reason for the revolutionists to select him as the leader of the coup d’etat in 1799.\n\nNapoleon and the Revolution\n\nNapoleon’s popularity and his character offered a solution to the years of revolution that had torn apart the French society, as one of the most fundamental reasons for the never-ending turmoil was the revolutionists’ inability to select a reliable leader who would become the face of the revolution. Napoleon shaped the Revolution to the same extent as it shaped him, and he expressed his view of this complex connection in saying “I am the Revolution” (Walsh 71).\n\nThe leading position of Napoleon affected the revolution in three distinct ways. First, it acknowledged the critical role of the military in governing the society. Through his successful military career, Napoleon has managed to collect most of the country’s military powers in his hands, which ultimately helped him in performing the coup d’etat in 1799. His commanding style has prompted a shift from the traditional army approach to operations to relying on risky strategies and enthusiasm, which eventually helped him to seize power from the contemporary government.\n\nSecondly, Napoleon has created a clear vision of what the role of the new, reformed government should be. From the very beginning of his studies, he expressed a solid belief that the government’s main function was the protection of the citizens (Forrest 36). The new vision proposed by Napoleon offered the revolutionists a certain standard to aspire to, which aided them in promoting the new ideals of leadership and governance. Lastly, Napoleon’s rise to power prompted for the beginning of the new era of leadership, which contrasted the previous clerical style.\n\nThe Napoleonic Era\n\nNapoleon’s role in the French Revolution allowed him to become the ultimate leader of the new government and to execute his vision of the government and its function. Napoleon became the founder of the modern state of France, a secular state which was largely based on a conscripted army and professional bureaucracy (Lyons 295). He promoted a change in all areas of the ruling, particularly by establishing new laws and regulations: “The affairs of all citizens were dealt with in principle on a basis of equality and according to fixed regulations, instead of being at the mercy of a monarch’s whim” (Lyons 295-296).\n\nSuch changes, however, also led to the development of dictatorship: despite adhering to the principles of equality and effective governance, Napoleon’s regime exhibited contempt of the liberal intellectual and democratic movements, thus proving unable to solve the issues outlined by the revolutionists (Lyons 297). Nevertheless, the Napoleonic rule has managed to preserve the social gains of the Revolution, which earned him the support of the reformed nobility, the Notables, consisting of the successful revolutionary bourgeoisie, professional, administrators, and commercial elites (Lyons 298).\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, even though Napoleon did not enter the political scene of the French Revolution until 1799, his influence on the overall flow of the Revolution was still critical. Napoleon promoted the ideas of equality, military governance, and strict regulation of all aspects of people’s lives, which offered people the security that the previous government failed to grant. In essence, it was Napoleon’s background, education, and military career that shaped the ending of the French Revolution and its aftermath, forming a new society and a reformed nation.\n\nThe exploration of Napoleon’s role in the French Revolution shows that his influence was critical in establishing the new standards of governance by which the Revolution shaped the new state of France.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nConnelly, Owen.

Investigation of Contemporary Issues: Technology and Business\n 6. Conclusions and Recommendations\n 7. Reference List\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe second part of the Business Report for Balogne Pty. Ltd addresses the issues of financial forecasting and the sphere of business and technology. Microsoft Excel has been applied to the creation of four graphs and one table demonstrating the company’s predicted performance based on such key indicators as earnings, earnings by product, variable costs, and sell prices. It has been explained how certain market influences, such as inflation/deflation, can affect the calculations of predictions. Further, contemporary business issues have been addressed, including knowledge management, business intelligence, Five Forces, and security.\n\nIntroduction\n\nUpon reflecting on the role of business modeling and process modeling in decision-making, the use of Microsoft Excel for calculations, and the adoption of Web 2.0 applications for internal and external communications, the business analyst of Balogne Pty. Ltd, a company that produces several types of sugar products, turns to forecasting and strategic business planning.\n\nFor the newly appointed General Manager, it is important to receive predictions as per the company’s expected performance and factors that may affect the operation in the nearest future. Three areas will be addressed as part of these business analytics efforts: forecasting financial performance (with the use of graphs demonstrating key indicators of financial dynamics), accumulating predicted financial data (with the use of a pivot table), and investigating contemporary issues related to technology and business, including knowledge management, business intelligence, market forces, and security.\n\nForecast Graphs\n\nIn financial planning, strategic decisions should be based on future projections; even though such projections’ accuracy may be questionable (due to the constantly changing market trends and influences), there is still a need for Balogne Pty. Ltd to build forecasts as per such crucial financial indicators as revenues, costs, and earnings and such considerations as the dynamics of these indicators among the company’s products. The first prediction to be designed is the prediction of earnings; it should be based on the current indicators, inflation/deflation rates, and volume sold. The result of the prediction is presented below (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Yearly USD earnings forecast by product.\n\nEarnings are calculated as the difference between revenue and cost: revenue, in turn, is the product of multiplying volume sold by the selling price, and the cost is the product of volume sold and variable cost plus fixed cost (overhead).\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, costs and prices are affected by the inflation/deflation rate, and there is growth/loss dynamics for volume sold, too. By considering all these factors and inputting data correctly into relevant software, such as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, a business analyst will be able to predict earnings and provide the General Manager with the information needed for strategic decision making. Further, looking into the dynamics of earnings distribution among different products is needed to improve product policies of Balogne Pty. Ltd (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: Estimated percentage of total earnings by-product (2015 to 2017).\n\nAs can be seen from the graph above, golden syrup is accountable for the smallest portion of earnings. White sugar sales generate the largest portion of earnings, and these earnings are expected to grow in 2017 (Figure 1). The product accountable for the second-largest portion of earnings is brown sugar (Figure 2), but it has been demonstrating a consistent decline in earnings generation within the three years (Figure 1).\n\nHowever, as it has been mentioned, this information is based on certain predicted financial rates, and it should not be overlooked that these rate’s dynamics may be significantly different from the predictions. The use of such software as Microsoft Excel provides convenient opportunities for incorporating these considerations into a business analysis spreadsheet.\n\nBy modifying the rate in one cell (which contains a fixed inflation/deflation rate), a user can see the changes in numbers in all the cells that refer to inflation/deflation, i.e. the numbers that depend on the rate; also, the graph immediately changes and displays new numbers based on the newly determined rate. For example, variable cost per unit dynamics can be explored for the situation in which the inflation/deflation rate for 2016 and 2017 is not -5 percent and 20 percent respectively but 15 percent and 25 percent respectively (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: Variable cost per unit dynamics at an alternative inflation/deflation forecast.\n\nWhen modifying the variable cost per unit dynamics, a user immediately modifies the total annual cost indicator and the total earnings level. However, it should be considered that the growth of variable cost per unit cannot pass unnoticed for the market, as it will affect the selling price per unit indicator. According to a new prediction, the latter rate in 2016 and 2017 is 25 percent and 35 percent respectively instead of 5 percent and 10 percent (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4: Sell price per unit dynamics at an alternative inflation/deflation forecast.\n\nAlong with the fixed cost, both indicators presented in the two graphs above will affect total earnings. Therefore, their dynamics should be monitored by a business analyst. Particular attention should be paid to the role of external market influences on the variable cost and sell price.\n\nPivot Table\n\nPivot tables can be successfully used for analysis in various spheres, and Microsoft Excel provides proper technologies for that. It has been claimed by researchers that a pivot table is a “highly flexible contingency table” (Dierenfeld & Merceron 2012, p. 116), which means that the format of a table allows modifying previously inputted data using formulas and connections established among different cells. A pivot table for Balogne Pty. Ltd is presented below (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Pivot Table of Balogne Pty.

Also, it can be used for the creation of graphs, such as graphs presented in the previous section (see Forecast Graphs) to visualize the predictions and dynamics of the key indicators of the company’s financial performance. In case the predictions change (e.g. by the changing inflation/deflation), the data in the table can be modified for each product, and the final indicators, i.e. total earnings, will be recalculated by the software.\n\nInvestigation of Contemporary Issues: Technology and Business\n\nFurther analysis of Balogne Pty Ltd’s current and expected performance will encompass the issues of knowledge management, business intelligence, Five Forces, and security. Concerning knowledge management, scholars pay much attention to the way the work of knowledge workers can be improved, optimized, and made more efficient, and the definition of a knowledge work that is widely adopted by scholars today includes “both the utilization and creating of abstract/theoretical knowledge” (Hislop 2013, p. 71). Also, an important aspect of knowledge work is that it is intellectual and mostly non-routine.\n\nTherefore, it may present challenges for managing, monitoring, and evaluating because the product and value of intellectual work are hard to measure. Many business management strategies have been proposed, and a particular aspect of a company’s performance addressed by them is a situation with senior workers in Balogne Pty. Ltd. Senior workers are used to certain practices and procedures that may be unfamiliar or poorly understood by new workers, and the former do not always document information related to these practices and procedures because it is a routine for them. As a result, business analysts are not supplied with complete information on the company’s internal operation, and the effectiveness of analytics is undermined.\n\nA way to address this complication is to establish a teaching and learning environment. Senior workers should be encouraged to share various aspects of their experience with new workers. As a result, the process of new workers’ improvement will be accelerated, and all the necessary documentation of processes in which senior workers are involved will be maintained because they will be asked to properly reflect on the practices they teach.\n\nAlso, additional training provided by senior employees will contribute to the knowledge management efforts of the company because relevant knowledge will be accumulated and exchanged. This practice will help the company pursue the purpose of business intelligence, i.e. ‘to support better business decision making’ ( Business intelligence n.d., para. 1) using collecting, storing, retrieving, exchanging, and analyzing information.\n\nIn analyzing Balogne Pty. Ltd’s supplier power, the Five Forces model designed by Porter can be applied (Dobbs 2014, p. 32). The model encompasses four kinds of external influences—two bargaining powers (of suppliers and buyers) and two threats (of new entrants and substitutes)—and one internal, ongoing influence: industry rivalry, i.e. the competition itself. For a company, it is important to recognize all five influences and adjust its operation to the changing conditions of the market. It is particularly relevant for Balogne Pty. Ltd because the company is currently growing, which means that its enlarging operation is more likely to face the impact of industry trends and possible external changes. Future sales can be particularly affected by the two threats recognized in Porter’s model.\n\nRecent research confirms that sugar is a much more harmful substance for humans than it was previously believed (Groopman 2017); therefore, it can be expected that, in the nearest future, many new players will appear in the industry that will offer sugar substitutes, and many people may be willing to buy those substitutes instead of sugar and sugar products produced by Balogne Pty. Ltd.\n\nAlso, the company should not overlook the bargaining power of its suppliers, i.e. farmers, on future sales. In case suppliers face difficulties due to the decreasing demand for sugar, they may renegotiate the existing conditions of collaborating with the company. Depending on the extent of amending the current agreements, the company may face the need to reorganize its operation and its production facilities. Finally, there is a factor within the industry.\n\nThe company’s competitors can manage to adapt to the arising conditions of decreasing demand for sugar, i.e. by offering substitutes, and this will mean that these competitors will address the same needs of the same customers as those they addressed before but in a new way. In the case of Balogne Pty. Ltd fails to make this shift in the nearest future, its indicators of successful financial performance will be damaged.\n\nFinally, in terms of security, the new General Manager needs to take into consideration different threats, both external and internal. In this context, security is understood as the company’s ability to collect, store, and retrieve information regarding its suppliers, customers, and internal operation safely. Two internal threats to proper security are poorly designed information systems and poorly trained employees. To address the former threat, the General Manager should ensure that the software used by the company for any operations with information is of good quality, regularly updated, and adjusted to the company’s needs.\n\nThe processes of selecting and operating information systems should be coordinated by the management so that the risk of compromising important (and often confidential information) is minimized. Concerning the latter threat—poorly trained employees—it should be recognized that important data can be compromised due to the incorrect use of information systems or data collection instruments (McBride, Carter & Warkentin 2012, p. 1).\n\nHowever, employees should be trained not only on the technical aspects of working with information (i.e. on how to use particular software) but also on corporate ethics, e.g. it should be generally understood and respected that certain types of information should remain confidential so that the company does not let down its suppliers, customers, or employees.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nBalogne Pty. Ltd is expected to demonstrate moderately successful financial performance, as its earnings growth for most products, although the earnings for some popular products decrease. However, an important threat is recognized: the demand for sugar can decline significantly in the nearest future, which should prompt the company to look for alternative ways of addressing its customers’ needs.\n\nImproved knowledge management strategies will allow pursuing the goals of business intelligence, and increased attention to the selection and operation of information systems and technology- and ethics-related training for employees will allow improving the company’s security. Overall, it is assessed that the company, with its current performance, can overcome these challenges, and a properly designed business strategy will help address the issues outlined above.\n\nReference List\n\nBusiness intelligence n.d.

      "Respiratory Disorder and Nursing Treatment Plan Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Pathophysiology of Acute Bronchitis\n 3. Age and Gender\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nWith the patient describing such symptoms of a deep cough, the production of mucous, green sputum, and scratchy throat, it is recommended to proceed with the treatment for acute bronchitis. Bronchitis refers to the inflammation of the patient’s bronchial tubes.\n\nThis inflammation causes a cough, irritation in the throat, and the occasional shortness of breath. As a rule, bronchitis appears due to the exposure to a virus or factors that irritate breathing, such as air pollution, dust, or tobacco smoke (Khan, Gotter, & Boskey, 2017). Maria’s diagnosis is acute bronchitis because her coughing has been taking place for several weeks while other symptoms of the disease have disappeared.\n\nPathophysiology of Acute Bronchitis\n\nDuring the episode of acute bronchitis, the cells that make up the bronchial-lining tissue get irritated, with “the mucous membrane becoming hyperemic and edematous, thus diminishing the function of the bronchi” (Fayyaz & Olade, 2017, para. 1). As a result, the debris clogs the air passage, leading to severe irritation (Fayyaz & Olade, 2017). To deal with the clogging of the passage, the bronchi develop mucus that facilitates a cough that is characteristic of acute bronchitis (Fayyaz & Olade, 2017).\n\nInflamed bronchial tubes significantly restrict the normal movement of air, subsequently causing wheezing, tightness in the chest, and shortness of breath, which are all alterations associated with the patient’s cough. A cough is a protective reflex that the body uses to “clear the airways through explosive expiration” (Huether & McCance, 2017, p. 687). Inhaled particles such as dust or smoke, pollution, the gradual mucus accumulation in the bronchi, irritation, and inflammation disrupt the receptors in the airway (Huether & McCance, 2017). Such receptors include distal bronchi and alveoli.\n\nAge and Gender\n\nAcute bronchitis does not usually last a long time and does not impose any permanent complications on patients that are normally healthy, as seen in Maria’s case. In the majority of cases, only people with weakened immune systems and other problems with health can experience bronchitis developing into more complex issues such as respiratory failure or pneumonia. Usually, adults aged 45 and older are more likely to develop bronchitis since the disease is linked to the weakened immune system, which deteriorated due to other factors such as diabetes or COPD.\n\nAccording to Ferre et al. (2012), in women, bronchitis was likely to develop because of the impaired health status and activity; however, socioeconomic factors such as work loss also contributed to the development of bronchitis among women. Overall, Maria’s age is more likely to be a factor that plays a role in the development of her bronchitis rather than her gender. On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge the connections between mental and physical health. As a woman, Maria deals with stress and life problems in a way that is different from men; it can be proposed that gender can also play a role in the development of bronchitis since stress causes an imbalance in the immune system making the organism more susceptible to viruses and irritants.\n\nTo conclude, Maria’s case requires the development of a treatment plan to manage her severe cough. Irritants such as smoke and air pollution should be avoided; medication treatment can include bronchodilators to handle the cough. It is recommended for Maria to drink more fluids and have some rest in order to boost her immune system and help the body fight the virus.\n\nReferences\n\nFayyaz, J., & Olade, R. (2017).

      "Globalization and Nation States Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Sources of Tension\n 2. Economic Challenges\n 3. Globalized Crime\n 4. Works Cited\n\nIn a world that used to contain many sorts of political entities, a unified nation-state mode of government is one of the direct consequences of political globalization. Their power is proved by the fact that they have absorbed all other units over time; just as the whole world relies firmly on institutionalized mass schooling, it relies on nation-states (Baker and LeTendre, 2015, p. 262). On the other hand, the globalization of issues that concern the entire humanity (hate crimes and terrorism, smuggling, and trafficking, etc.) challenge their might (Lechner and Boli, 2015, p. 231). There are several aspects of globalization that call to question the states’ ability to control and manage themselves.\n\nSources of Tension\n\nTechnological advancement and the cheapness of energy can potentially benefit the global business by reducing the price of some operations. But although the costs may be reduced, the governments pay higher prices in other respects: they lose control over their societies, which fall under stronger influences or the impacts from without (Strange, 2015, p. 232). Arab Spring can be a suitable example of how ideas swerve into the nations undermining their order. Other sources of tension include the reduction of trade barriers, which, although they facilitate economic growth, create misbalance between those who can go over transnational borders and the “human pollutants,” and prevent nations from providing insurance to their populations (Rodrik, 2015, p. 247).\n\nEconomic Challenges\n\nJust as nation-states can be weakened by the ideational flow from outside the borders, they can be challenged in economic terms. Such organizations as WTO, IMF, and the World Bank seem to have more power over the states’ economies than the states themselves in a process endorsed by OECD flying the U. S. flag (Strange, 2015, p. 234). Although the world can resist the globalization processes (such as the notorious Seattle protest against the WTO in the late 1990s), the global market is designed to account for – presumably – global interests, wherein the nation-states have little to say.\n\nThe opinions of the non-industrialized and developing nation-states are the least accounted for, with the countries leading the economic liberalization choosing where to invest and move their businesses. Developing countries, naturally, appear to be an unworthy investment, especially if they are affected by debts or other factors such as population education, disease burdens, etc. (Glenn, 2015, p. 258). The pressures of the globalized economy, therefore, will be most evident and influential in developing states.\n\nGlobalized Crime\n\nAccording to Mittelman, there is a number of tendencies that transform localized crime groups into more organized and widespread entities (2015, p. 240). Chinese smuggling of people, Malian drug trafficking and destructions of the vehicles afterward, Colombian and Nigerian illegal businesses based on diaspora and familial ties – these are few examples among the plethora of other crimes. Organized transnational groups can be structured differently and use varying modes of money pooling but the fact is that their rise was mainly facilitated by globalization with its technology breakthroughs and border thinning.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBaker, David P., and Gerald K.

      "“Apocalypse Now” and “Apocalypse Now Redux” Films Essay\n\nApocalypse Now is an American movie directed by Francis Coppola released in 1979. It tells a story of Captain Willard, who is assigned a dangerous mission to find and assassinate a renegade colonel Kurtz in the jungles of Cambodia. The movie was adapted from a novella “Heart of Darkness” by Joseph Conrad, which raises issues of racism and imperialism. Today, it is recognized as an epic movie about the Vietnam War, but at first, it was highly criticized for its darkness and unusual plot.\n\nAfter more than two decades, Coppola released an extended version of the movie in a digital format called Apocalypse Now Redux. This essay will discuss the central theme of the movie, compare and contrast the original Apocalypse Now and its Redux version, and discuss their historical significance to the cinema.\n\nIn 2001, Zoetrope Studios released a director’s version of the film extended from the original movie, entitled Apocalypse Now Redux . It included some materials that were not used in the theatrical release. A new, more complete director’s version of the film was supplemented by philosophical meaning, sexual scenes, and intriguing political discussions. The second release was explained by the director’s desire to reconstruct the movie from falling into a conventional war movie because the political situation changed (Shao and Liu 101).\n\nOver the twenty-year period, technological conditions in cinema editing advanced dramatically as well as economic conditions in cinematography. Producers used the opportunity to enhance the visual and audio experience. The Redux version had improved aesthetically and context-wise: improved color restoration and enhanced soundtrack, Paramount logo was present at the beginning, some scenes had semantic ligament, and it had better color separation, high definition, screen ratio, and synchronous sound ( Apocalypse Now Redux ).\n\nA cultural study found that this version added new narrative elements that “paid more attention to minority groups, the darkness in war and media quagmire, which is related to different historical and political contexts” (Shao and Liu 100). Indeed, characters in the newest version had more humanity in their attitudes. While the initial release was surrealistic and somewhat insane, the Redux version reminded of a documentary.\n\nEvents in the original version went by at a faster pace and did not necessarily follow a correct timeline, making it more exciting and entrancing, whereas, in Redux, many scenes were rearranged. Overall, Apocalypse Now Redux depicted improved attitude to minority groups and provided a more comprehensive reflection of the Vietnam War, added more humanity and content, and was improved aesthetically (Shao and Liu 106).\n\nPrevious works of Coppola differed significantly: he started off his career with a pornographic movie that lacked any style whatsoever. The Godfather , an epic gangster drama with impressive and laconic dialogues, excellent performances of the cast, and superb editing, made him famous and established Coppola as a serious director in cinematography. Apocalypse Now used various techniques, for instance, a shadow technique – people’s faces were half-lit to dramatize; saturated colors made it look like everything was on fire, dissolve effect made a smooth transition between scenes; camera shots used different angles such as extreme close up to Willard, and low angles of Kurtz.\n\nSome critics said Apocalypse Now was a metaphoric portrayal of Coppola himself. He wanted full freedom in creating this film and had to deal with challenges imposed on this freedom. Compared to his previous works, Apocalypse Now required more effort and skilled directing as the shooting location depended on the weather conditions; actors often lacked discipline and were unprepared, even the script was not finished. Eventually, Coppola overcame these challenges and created a masterpiece of cinematography.\n\nEvery viewer can interpret this movie differently. However, one of the most important aims of the movie is to open criticism of Western imperialism. Hiding behind an idea of “fighting for freedom,” the United States performed massive killings of innocent people, at the same time, misspent their own human resources.\n\nFor instance, take a look at the scene where Lieutenant Kilgore completely changed his military plans disregarding the possible human losses to have the opportunity to ride the surf with a celebrity ( Apocalypse Now ). The war was shown not as a planned operation to destroy a village where some enemies have settled, but a set of accidents and impulses driven by U.S. intervention.\n\nThe dramatic premise of the movie is that Captain Willard- the main character, emotionally unstable and undecided about his life, is assigned a dangerous mission after a long stagnation. Willard was dedicated to war, as he had nothing else: no cozy home or family waiting for him. At first, he showed little care for the mission and Kurtz’s personality. As Willard got closer to Kurtz, he tried to understand what prompted a brilliant officer to organize a riot and desert from the army.\n\nWillard became more sympathetic to the former colonel and at the end began to identify himself with Kurtz. Under the influence of the surrounding events, Willard gradually lost the sense of reality as he approached the goal and ceased to understand what to do next. Willard changed from his drunken, lonely, self-pitying state to insanity: he too rethought a lot about war and followed Kurtz’s philosophy. The plot is not so much about the war as about the path of a man. The film takes the viewer far into the depths of the human psyche, and war serves only as a backdrop for the manifestation of those human qualities that usually do not lie on the surface.\n\nMany things distinguish Apocalypse Now from all movies about war regarding its historical significance to cinema. Firstly, this film encountered significant obstacles during the shooting. For instance, the U.S. Army refused to support it, some cast members were physically unprepared, and weather conditions troubled shooting and more (Travers 69). Thus, movie production, suffering from a finance shortage, lasted for three years: one year of shooting and two years of editing.\n\nHowever, the film turned out to be visually magnificent. All scenes had a perfect combination of sound, light, music and overlapping transitions that created a surrealistic atmosphere. Throughout the movie, a viewer could feel the physical representation of the characters’ inner feelings and emotional states achieved via excellent cinematography techniques.\n\nFull of meaning, this is not an action movie, but a psychological drama that makes one think about the imperfection of this world with wars and violence. It distinguishes from other war movies by its thought- provoking plot and presentation style.\n\nProducers masterfully manipulated dialogues, sound effects, light, and various scenes to deliver the exact emotional state depicted in the movie. In my opinion, the original version was more artistic and lively due to the director’s ability to portray reality as something surreal. It involved more creativity and editing skills. Redux version, on the other hand, was re-edited like a documentary with a deeper insight into the historical aspect and created a different mood.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nApocalypse Now.

      "Durable Vinyl Siding Corporation’s Case Case Study\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Organizational changes\n 3. Computerization changes\n 4. Benefits of e-commerce to DVS\n 5. Recommendation on the use of SKUs\n 6. Strategies for maintaining service levels\n\nIntroduction\n\nDurable Vinyl Siding Corporation (DVS) is a leading manufacturer of vinyl siding products for home and commercial buildings. The company experiences high record sales year on year, topping $250 million in 2006, which was 15% higher than in 2005. Although this is the case, it is facing increasing operating profits which is eating into net profits of the company, originating operations in the company that the management is seeking to put under control. In our case, we will consider procurement department operations and point out what the company can address to arrest the rising costs.\n\nOrganizational changes\n\nOrganizations come with changes, and it is important that these changes are well articulated. Organizational changes are bound to happen. The changes should be taken well so that the overall structure comes out well. The company added staff almost every year and who have proved from the analysis that they are a burden to the payroll. The staff has over the past been assigned as buyers of products of the specific group but this has to change with an immediate effect.\n\nThe company can do restructuring by doing a critical job evaluation to see what job skills are needed and keep them and those who are found to be redundant have to be let go immediately to reduce the wage bill. Having a lean workforce that can multitask and be able to deliver more efficiently is important. The remaining staff to be trained on how to use the computer system in inventory control. Apart from restructuring, the stocked raw materials that are in the warehouse can be enough for the number of months mentioned. No new raw materials should then be ordered until about the time needed to free up warehouse space.\n\nComputerization changes\n\nThe procurement computer system can be upgraded to serve more roles in controlling the procurement of all raw materials and keeping sales records. Currently, the warehouse is full to capacity, forcing the company to procure storage services elsewhere. Procurement can be systemized to be notifying management about the need for raw materials as, and when it is needed to reduce over-procuring to ease space at the warehouse eventually reducing costs of hiring more capacity for storage.\n\nBenefits of e-commerce to DVS\n\nE-commerce can benefit the company in three ways majorly. The company can be able to shop online by comparing prices of raw materials in the market from various sellers before making a buy decision. On making the decision the company will pay for the goods online. The system can also link with a logistics company that can be procured online free and tendered to deliver the goods to the company when needed. This will eliminate staff members who have employed specifically to procure a transporter. The company can also advertise the product on the company’s website and enable shoppers to place orders. After placing orders deliveries are made. This can also mean minimizing the over-dependence sales staff, therefore might mean no hiring in the foreseeable future.\n\nRecommendation on the use of SKUs\n\nI would strongly recommend the use of computers and e-commerce for all the 5000 SKUs purchased to track down the stock in order as peruse. The system by the computer will eliminate manual labor that has been used in the past to control the usage. The computer will in due course of time help to reduce unnecessary SKUs and bring it to manageable quantities and give management a cost-effective strategy to control costs. The warehouse is full and major costs saving can be realized when these unnecessary stock are brought down to small quantities able to serve the production for a foreseeable future.\n\nStrategies for maintaining service levels\n\nSales have been somewhat growing in a trend that can simply be interpreted using the sales figures over the past 20 years. The business figures from the last twenty years can be an asset to use to predict future business growth in terms of sales. Using the sales figures for a foreseeable future will inform the number of raw materials needed to produce the amount of output that will make the sales. Then the company will order the raw materials according to needs. It can be divided into months to determine the need for raw materials each month.\n\nThe company will not need extra staff to do the analysis to come up with the figures. It can be done by computer software with one staff member inputting the figures for the computer to analyze or at an inventory control unit where when products are sold to the market the computer system can be storing daily sales which will be compiled at the end of the month, for example, to give a final tabulated report to be issued to the management to use to make informed decisions at a cost-effective manner. The system will be tabulating raw material as they are used in the factory flow when they are picked from the warehouse.\n",
      "American Legal System, Its Role and Functions Essay\n\nThe United States is a democratic country which relies on the rule of law to establish justice and protect constitutional rights of its citizens. The judicial system, which encompasses a network of courts, acts as a mechanism which upholds order by applying the law to resolve disputes and affects many aspects of our society, including business.\n\nBefore the supreme law of the United States, the constitution, was adopted, justice had been established by the Articles of Confederation ( Outline of the U.S. Legal System , 2004, p. 20). During that time, executive and legislative branches were not separated, and the role of the national government was performed by Congress. At the Constitutional Convention in 1787, policy makers concluded that it was necessary to create a national judiciary ( Outline of the U.S. Legal System , 2004, p. 20). At the convention, the Virginia and New Jersey delegations presented two different plans which defined the legislative structure of the United States. The former plan was adopted and formed the basis of the United States judiciary as it exists today, with two systems of courts, federal and state courts.\n\nThe United States constitution divides the authority between federal and state courts ( The Constitution of the United States , art. III). The federal court system is comprised of the Supreme Court and two levels of federal courts, created by Congress. The two systems of federal courts are the United States district courts and courts of appeal ( The U.S. Legal System: A Short Description , n.d., p. 1). Nine judges of the Supreme Court hear appeals from lower courts in those cases if appeals concert violation of constitutional rights or federal law ( The U.S. Legal System: A Short Description , n.d., p. 2).\n\nThe Supreme Court has an authority over other courts and can change the verdict given by the lower court. This fact is possible due to the concept of judicial review, which is the foundation of the legislative system. The concept of judicial review implies that the decisions of state and federal courts are subject to review and change in cases the decisions violate constitutional rights of the United States citizens or any other existing law (Kramer, 2004). The concept of the judicial review is one of the safeguards that protect defendants from prejudice and unfair treatment.\n\nThe State Court system includes state courts, the function of which varies from state to state ( The U.S. Legal System: A Short Description , n.d., p. 2). Generally, most state courts have a limited jurisdiction and hear minor cases. In the state courts the decision is most often made by a single judge.\n\nAlongside a traditional court system, a separate set of practices exist to support the resolution of legal disputes called alternative dispute resolution (ADR) (Mnookin, 1998, p. 56). ADR typically comes in a variety of forms as “mediation, arbitration, and a variety of “hybrid” processes by which a neutral facilitates the resolution of legal disputes without formal adjudication” (Mnookin, 1998, p. 56). Unlike a traditional court system, ADR can be used to find the resolution for those issues, which may not be considered appropriate for court based adjudication. In business, ADR can be used to resolve disputes between business partners or stakeholders. In addition, settlement conferences can be used to discuss and offer settlements to close the dispute without taking it to the court.\n\nAny business operating in the United States is to comply with state and federal laws. As such, the actions of business owners and employees are guided by the laws and regulations which establish fair conditions for business operation. Several governmental agencies, such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, exist to monitor business activities and prevent fraudulent practices. The judicial system plays an important part in administering justice and governing fair practices in the area of business. For example, if a business attempts to mislead its clients, the clients are free to take the dispute to the court for it to be resolved. Consumer rights are also protected by the state and national constitution.\n\nFor example, the right of privacy, which is outlined in the California’s constitution, has been used in court to cases against businesses which made inappropriate requests in regard to the employee’s personal life ( Rulon-Miller v. International Business Machines Corp. , n.d.). In the field of radiologic technology, a variety of standards and regulations exist that regulate the work of radiologic technologists. Some states require the radiologic technologists to have a specific certification in order to operate. At the same time, as other health care professionals, radiologic technologists are “subject to both criminal and civil penalties for misconduct in the course of carrying out professional duties” (Lynn, 1999, p. 257). The decisions radiologic technologists make are based upon the law in addition to personal and professional ethics.\n\nThe law and the judiciary play an important role in a democratic society and business. A democratic society relies on the rule of law to establish justice and protect human right, and business relies on it to ensure fair business practices. In addition to traditional court system, ADR helps businesses resolve disputes in a timely manner without taking the matter to the court.\n\nReferences\n\nKramer, L. (2004).

      "Mummy in McDaniel’s “Gone with the Wind” Movie Essay\n\nGone with the Wind is one of the most powerful and famous classic movies in the whole world. Though it was created in far 1939, the movie contains plenty of interesting and educative scenes that could be used by modern people. The lessons the main actors offered to people could not be counted. The plays of Leigh, Gable, and Havilland were impressive indeed. At the same time, it is impossible not to mention the supporting role performed by Hattie McDaniel in Gone with the Wind . Her Mammy impressed a number of people, and her physical and vocal choices influenced the world of cinema considerably. It seems that all McDaniel’s choices were made correctly because the image of Mammy helped to understand the true worth of Black slaves, the importance of staying committed to people and duties, and the example of dignity and humanity that should be inherent to all people.\n\nMcDaniel’s Mammy is one of the most powerful characters in the movie Gone with the Wind. The success of her work could be proved by the fact that she was the first African-American Oscar winner. From the first seconds of Mammy’s appearance, it became clear that her character was strong and confident. Mammy knew her duties, and she understood that her task was to take care of Scarlett and make sure that the girl followed the orders of her parents. Her first appearance told a lot about the correctly made physical and vocal choices. Though Gone with the Wind was not a musical, and Hattie McDaniel did not demonstrate her vocal abilities, her voice in dialogues could make a person laugh or cry in several seconds. She impressed with her mimics and the ability to listen to her. For example, the phrase that “what gentlemen say and what they think is two different things” ( Gone with the Wind ) to make Scarlett eat a bit at home made me smile and believe that Mammy’s experience was enough to say that, and Scarlett, in her turn, changed her mind and started eating. Even her snorting and glances deserved the right to be in the movie as an example of how an ordinary Black servant could react to the actions of her White masters. She introduced a true image of a Black slave that included the possibility to be confident in her thoughts and beliefs and to respect her masters.\n\nIn addition to the power in her voice and look, her activities and statements told a lot about her attitude to the people she had to work for and the desire to stay committed to Scarlett, her parents, and the land she had to live at. After viewing the film, I would like to compare the character of Mammy with the image of Tara, the plantation Scarlett’s family lives at. Though both of them performed supporting roles, their importance in the lives of the main characters could not be neglected. At the beginning of the movie, Mammy performed the role of Scarlett’s guardian and carer. In the middle of the movie, Mammy was introduced as a devoted servant of the O’Hara’s land. At the end of the film, Mammy became a kind of emotional backbone with the help of which Scarlett and Rhett Butler could survive her grief.\n\nIn my opinion, in Gone with the Wind , Mammy could also be an example of how dignity and humanity should look like. The relations Mammy developed with Rhett could be used as one of the possible explanations. When Rhett appeared in the life of Scarlett, Mammy could not accept him as he was due to his unpredictable behavior, sharp phrases, and a kind of open insolence that he was not eager to hide. Though Mammy did not demonstrate her negative attitude to Rhett, he got to know about her thoughts via Scarlett and underlined that “Mammy’s a smart old soul. And one of the few people who’re the respect I’d like to have” ( Gone with the Wind ). Though Mammy was not present, her character and its importance in the story were perfectly developed and explained in that scene. At the end of the movie, the fact that Mammy took care of Rhett’s emotional instability and wanted to help him by any possible means proved that she was the person whose respect was gained by Rhett.\n\nIn general, Mammy seems to be one of the strongest and properly developed characters in the movie Gone with the Wind . There are no doubts that Hattie McDaniel’s Oscar was given for her great contribution to the world of cinema. Her physical appearance supported the main idea of house servants. Her voice and persuasion proved the image of true Black people, who had nothing to do but work for other people and earn for living in the middle of the 1800s. I did believe in every piece of her performance. I loved that character with all my soul because it helped to stay humane and dignified regardless of all challenges and standards of the world.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGone with the Wind.

      "Traditional Chinese Lion Dance and Its Styles Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nLion Dance is a form of Chinese traditional dance that was created more than ten centuries ago ( Chinese New Year Lion Dance par1). It involves the mimicry of a lion’s movements while adorning a lion costume and it is practiced in China and other Asian countries that share similar traditional practices and customs. The dance is usually performed during certain special occasions such as New Year festivals and other big occasions of critical importance such as cultural and religious festivals. It is also performed during events such as weddings and honoring of guests. The lion dance is usually performed using drums and gong instruments that act as accompaniments. In Chinese culture, the lion brings good luck, and therefore festivals that included the dance aim to bring good luck and scare away evil (Vasu par2).\n\nHistory\n\nThe dance originated in China more than a thousand years ago. In traditional Chinese culture, the lion was a mythical animal because lions were non-existent in the country ( History of the Lion Dance par3). Lions were sent to Chinese emperors by traders to be allowed to conduct business in their territories. Only a few lions had been seen in ancient China before the emergence of the Han Dynasty. Later on, more lions emerge and because they were mythical in China, people were mesmerized by them and began to mimic their behavior and appearance during performances. These performances mimicking the actions of lions led to the creation of the lion dance in the Han Dynasty ( History of the Lion Dance par4).\n\nThe Lion Dance became more popular with the spread of Buddhism in the Northern and Southern Dynasties and got to its peak during the Tang Dynasty. The rising popularity of the dance led to its embracement in Japan. In Japan, the dance was used in courts as a form of entertainment while in China it was used during celebrations. The dance later spread to Korea and Taiwan where it evolved into different styles but adopted similar symbolism ( History of the Lion Dance par5).\n\nStyles\n\nThere are two main styles of the Lion Dance namely the Southern Lion style and the Northern Lion style ( Chinese New Year Lion Dance par3). These styles emerged as the dance evolved through the years and as it spread to other dynasties around China. Other styles emerged as the dance spread to other Asian countries.\n\nThe Northern Lion style\n\nThis style closely resembles martial arts and has two variations in which a young lion is mimicked by a young person and an adult lion is mimicked by two people (Green 42). Both performers wear costumes that resemble a lion. For instance, their lower bodies are adorned with trousers that resemble the color of the lion’s body. Their shoes are colored yellow and are resemble a lion’s claws. In the dance that the performers mimic an adult lion, one performer stands in the front and the other one behind the first performer with a bent waist to make movements easy. The first performer adorns the head of the lion and the other moves the body of the lion (Vasu par7).\n\nThe performers then mimic several movements that are common among lions such as jumping, climbing, rolling, and wrestling (Green 42). The Northern Lion Dance is more versatile than the southern lion dance and incorporates additional stunts such as lifts and balancing on elevated platforms. In other dances, Northern Lions can appear as families. In that case, the dance includes two large adult lions and two young lions. To get the resemblance of an adult lion, two performers adorn the costume to appear large (Ma and Cartier 88). In more varied Northern Lion dances, a character representing a warrior stands in front of the lions and leads them through the dance.\n\nThe Southern Lion style\n\nThis style originated from a region called Guangdong and is performed in pairs (Vasu par8). The performers wear lion costumes and do moves that are more characteristic of the lion as compared to the Northern dance. These actions include scratching, licking fur, and shaking the posterior end of the body (Green 44). The movements make the performance more entertaining and dramatic. The lion can also perform other moves such as playing with a ball. The Southern Lion is associated with a mythical legend known as Nian in Chinese ancient culture. Unlike the Northern Lion, it has a playful temperament.\n\nThe social component of the Lion Dance\n\nThe Lion Dance was usually performed during social events that were either cultural or religious. In many Asian countries, it is performed during the New Year Festival and other cultural, traditional, and religious festivals such as the performance of rituals (Ma and Cartier 88). Also, it is performed during events to open new businesses, marriage, and honorary ceremonies (Carstens 152). All these events are aimed at bringing people together and allowing them to socialize and celebrate their traditions and customs. In Japan, the dance is performed during Shinto festivals during which people gather to celebrate various religious rituals.\n\nOther styles\n\nAfter the spread of the Lion Dance to other Asian countries, variations on how it is performed emerged. They include Vietnamese, Korean, Tibetan, Japanese, and Indonesian Lion dances (Carstens 152). The Japanese Lion Dance is used in traditional and religious festivals. The style is highly versatile because it comprises more than 9,000 variations depending on the region. Korean Lion Dance has two main variations that are performed on different occasions that include exorcism drama and masked drama.\n\nTibetan Lion Dance is performed during important celebrations such as New Year Festival (performed as a secular dance) and religious festivals (ritual dance). The Indonesian Lion Dance is very different from the original dance. However, the symbolism is similar even though it utilizes different forms from those used in China and other Asian countries.\n\nMusic, instruments, and costumes\n\nThe performance of Lion Dance involves music and the use of different musical instruments. Examples of instruments used during the dance include drums, gongs, and cymbals (Ma and Cartier 88). The drum is the main instrument used and the other two are used as accompaniments. The drum gives the main beat of the dance and movements are synchronized to it (Carstens 153). The drum is also used to emphasize certain movements or actions during the performance.\n\nThe main purposes of using cymbals and gongs are to scare away bad luck and make the dance emotional (Carstens 153). The instruments are played in a manner that synchronizes to the movements of the lion to create harmony. The aforementioned variations of the lion dance use different music and play their instruments differently. Each style plays a distinctive beat that is closely associated with people’s customs and traditions.\n\nIn contemporary society, the development of electronic instruments has made the lion dance more entertaining and adaptable. For instance, the music can be played from a portable mp3 player. Technological advancement has contributed greatly to the evolution of lion dance because it has eliminated the need to carry heavy musical instruments around while dancing. Costumes are one of the distinctive features of the lion dance. They are usually custom made to resemble a lion with certain colors used to represent various body parts.\n\nHistorical symbolism\n\nThe Lion Dance was used during the Three Kingdoms Period to represent the various struggles that the kingdoms went through in the process of fighting for power and uniting the warring regions. The yellow lion with white hair represents calmness, moderation, competence, and wisdom. The red lion with black hair represents skills and wisdom. The black lion with corresponding black hair or white hair represents strength, courage, and character.\n\nThe colors used on the costumes represent various life or traditional aspects that are important to Chinese people. Yellow represents Earth, green represents wood, red represents fire, black represents water, and white represents metal (Carstens 156). In many costumes, the lion’s nose is usually green. Green is a representation of good luck, success, and the presence of divine intervention. Also, a mirror is attached to the lion’s forehead to scare away any evil spirit that may be residing among the people or that may be planning to attack the people.\n\nEvolution of the Lion Dance\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Lion Dance has evolved greatly since its creation. This evolution is primarily due to its spread to other cultures and the emergence of electronic instruments that have changed how it is performed. The presence of Chinese people in countries around the world has led to vast embracement of the dance and its subsequent evolution. In traditional China, the dance was performed as part of Chinese martial arts culture. It was performed during traditional and religious festivals. Its evolution has led to its adoption in competitions that aim to determine the dance with the best movements or performance. The versatility and agility of the ‘lion” are a core aspect of the strategy used to win in such competitions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Lion Dance is an ancient Chinese cultural dance that has evolved since its creation more than a thousand years ago during the Han dynasty. It involves the performance of moves and actions that mimic the behavior of lions while wearing costumes created to appear like lions. The dance is mainly used for social purposes during traditional and religious ceremonies. Its origin dates back to the Three Kingdoms Period during which the lion was only a mythical animal in Chinese folklore.\n\nThe first lions were seen in China when merchants presented them to Chinese emperors as gifts to be allowed to trade commodities in their territories. Afterward, people began to mimic their behaviors during performances. In China, it comprises two main styles namely the Southern Lion style and Northern Lion style. The dance has evolved significantly since its creation because of its embracement by other cultures and technological advancements. In contemporary society, the dance is performed in competitions. The drum, cymbals, and gongs are the major instruments used during performances.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCarstens, Sharon. Histories, Cultures, Identities: Studies in Malaysian Chinese Worlds .

References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper will be focused on the development of a beneficial employee relationship (ER) strategy that can be used by Boeing, an extended organisation that is located in the US but cooperates with foreign companies. The necessity of its creation occurred because the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) approached the National Labour Relations Board (NLRB) with the request to unionise the firm’s workers. It targeted at almost 2500 employees who are working at the South Carolina plant, which deals with the production of the design parts for the new airliner.\n\nThis plant has a history of labour unrest, which is a problem for the organisation because such complications can affect its performance adversely. In this situation, Boeing will not be able to prepare 1095 high-quality items of 787 Dreamliner. As a result, it can lose the loyalty of 60 customers and face a substantial loss of profit. Fortunately, in the current situation, IAM refused to vote for the unionisation. However, there is a high possibility that the petition will be repeated and this time it will be accepted. To prevent the appearance of further complications and organise the factory, unitarist and pluralist ER strategies for the South Carolina plant should be developed in advance. Then, they can be assessed decently and implemented with no delays to avoid possible issues.\n\nAlternative ER Strategies\n\nRelations with employees and unions are critical for all organisations because they provide an opportunity to maintain operations effectively and efficiently and to determine what alterations are needed for improvement. Preparing ER strategies, Boeing can receive a guideline for its South Carolina plan that defines the peculiarities of employee cooperation and aligns with the business strategy (Leat, 2001).\n\nIn the framework of unitarist perspective, the organisation should include in its strategy several vital elements that would form it. Thus, Boeing’s South Carolina plant should have only one source of authority. It should be separate management with no other possible leaders. All decisions should be made by the management should promote loyalty and commitment among the employees.\n\nThe plant should be seen as an entity, which unites not separate individuals but teams of workers who cooperate to reach common aims. In this way, the management must have no conflicts of interest with the personnel, which can prevent the plant from achieving mutual goals. Thus, the leader and one’s followers are to cooperate to achieve common objectives. Here, strong leadership is critical, as it determines the way people work and affects the outcomes.\n\nThus, ER strategy in the unitarist perspective should be focused on turning Boeing’s South Carolina plant into one entity that consists of working teams that cooperate efficiently and effectively, being controlled by a single leader who promotes employee loyalty and commitment, to meet mutual organisational goals.\n\nThe pluralist ideas differ greatly from the unitarist ones, which makes these two approaches opposite to each other. According to them, an organisation is a place, which gathers people with different beliefs and values. They are always diverse regardless of the similarities (Schmidt, 2009). The power in the organisation does not belong to one particular person, and several leaders can exist. Pluralism allows coexistence of competing interests, which often leads to conflicts that are still not treated as something critical and extremely adverse. On the contrary, they are perceived as a helpful tool that can be used to guide the company and its responses.\n\nThe management is treated not as an only leader but as a mediate that helps to find a compromise when some issues occur. Moreover, in the framework of pluralist perspective, employees’ decision-making power is underlined, which defines them as individuals capable to affect the organisation. The public interest is also promoted. Thus, the management considers the opinion of the staff when deciding to implement some change.\n\nFinally, it should be stated that negotiations play a critical role in the establishment of a stable environment in the organisation and stable positive performance. Managers and employees interact much and share their ideas, which provides an opportunity to balance all procedures and make them appropriate for everyone.\n\nThus, ER strategy in the pluralist perspective should be focused on turning Boeing’s South Carolina plant into a unity, which gathers the diverse population of workers who have their own beliefs and ideas but cooperate to reach the mutual goal, being led by managers but also having personal decision-making power and emphasizing negotiations as the source of understanding, stability and development.\n\nRelationships with Employees and Unions\n\nFor now, Boeing needs to consider both relations with employees and unions, as its South Carolina plant is still represented by the members of the staff while the majority of other facilities deal with AIM. The main difference is in power. While ordinary employees are not able to affect the peculiarities of the job, those who are a part of the union sign a contract where everything is mentioned.\n\nThus, the organisation is free to decide whether it is willing to control its employees and their actions or to encourage them to be committed to the organisational objectives and goals. At the same time, it should decide whether to “avoid, accommodate, or partner” with the unions (Bamber, Gittell, Kochan, & Nordenflycht, 2009, p. 11).\n\nIf nothing changes for Boeing, may try utilising control approach. The managers of its South Carolina plant can make all detections themselves and then just let the employees know what they should do, demanding obedience. Here, the hierarchy of job positions is stable and tough. The personnel are responsible only for coming to the plant on time and maintaining their duties on a high level. Such an approach may be beneficial for Boeing, as it will be sure that the workers do those things that are expected from them. However, the labour unrest may be faced again, if they turn out to be dissatisfied with the situation. In such a case, strikes seem to be the most common way out.\n\nWhen referring to the commitment approach, the managers will not give the orders but try to explain why particular actions are required and encourage the workers to undertake them. It looks much like an agreement, according to which the company promises to take care of the workers, while they are committed to it and its ideas. In this way, Boeing can refer to cross-functional teams and may make the range of duties more flexible, as well as scheduling, etc. The employees tend to appreciate such an approach, as it involves them more and does not focus on the demands.\n\nConsidering unions, the organisation can try to prevent their creation when suppressing their creation through the revealed resistance and aggressive actions or when substituting them by such improvements as increased wages so that there will be no need to gather. However, such prevention of union creation is considered to be a great deterrent to the company caused by its management (Kleiner, 2001). The act of substitution may appeal to the workers, but it is not likely to be undertaken, as it opposes Boeing’s business strategy.\n\nCurrently, Boeing operates based on the low-cost carrier (LCC) business model. In its framework, the organisation is willing to reduce airline costs with the help of cost-saving practices (Boeing, 2016b). Thus, it has low labour costs, which can cause employee dissatisfaction. Even though under the influence of the current alterations in the industry, some exceptions to the strategy may be found, Boeing tends to follow it. Thus, it would be better if a new ER strategy does not entail any changes regarding these aspects and will not try to unite the personnel, approaching them with compensation packages, etc.\n\nThe company can accept the existence of unions, which means to accommodate the unionisation of the South Carolina plant and its entrance to IAM. In this way, routine actions will be maintained, but Boeing will not be likely to support negotiations and give the workers more power. Such an approach is decent, as it does not trigger the development of new issues. Still, it also fails to provide many benefits. It is just an artificially created atmosphere of efficient cooperation.\n\nFinally, an organisation can be a partner with the union. Being involved in continuous communication, Boeing will allow the members of the IAM to be involved in the decision-making, and they will resolve issues through negotiation. They will follow a contract, which allows IAM to be a consultant for the plant. In this way, the workers will have more power and the hierarchy will not be so oppressive. The union will be satisfied and will not be likely to trigger labour unrest. Moreover, “the employer who is willing to give employees what they want and need are far more likely to have success, but more importantly, the organisations will be doing the right thing” (Karnes, 2009, p. 189).\n\nRecommendation\n\nToday, many professionals tend to mention that the organisations in the US and all over the world prefer to work with separate employees but not with the unions, such as IAM (Logan, 2006). They consider that the workers are not efficient enough to make vital decisions that can affect the performance of the organisation. Still, collective bargaining and efficient negotiation are critical for the firms, as they ensure the possibility of successful development (Kochan, 2012). In this way, unions are likely to take the leading role, as cooperation between employers and employees is in its core.\n\nAs Boeing is willing to see its employees working together as one unit, it is likely to unionise the personnel of the South Carolina plant to become stronger. Moreover, the company encourages its workers to share basic values and take personal responsibility for the actions conducted, value people’s lives and their well-being and underlines both personal and collective characteristics (Boeing, 2016a). However, it is critical to remember that the union is not a compulsory thing that should be always present. Moreover, its presence does not ensure that the ER will improve, and no conflicts will occur. In this way, it is critical to select the appropriate ER strategy.\n\nWhen trying to define what ER strategy should be utilised by Boeing when the workers from its South Carolina plant become a part of IAM, it should be taken into consideration that the US is a country that highly values individuality (Weaver, 2001). Even when emphasising the importance of the teamwork, Americans tend to perceive it as efficient cooperation of several employees who adjust to each other’s needs and share common values but still are separate individuals. Moreover, diversity at the workplace started to play an enormous role for the companies.\n\nPeople are encouraged to be different, as in this way they can bring more benefit to the organisations, especially when considering innovations and problem-solving. Different background and opinions provide a basis for development, which is likely to improve performance. The thing is that diverse employees are to be able to interact while working without any misunderstandings and other issues (Chang, 2006).\n\nMoreover, it is critical to make the ER strategy based on the vision of the organisation and values that are underlined by it. In this way, it seems that the company should refer to the pluralism ideas, as it is mentioned that the workers “are personally accountable for our safety and collectively responsible for each other’s safety” (Boeing, 2016a, para. 3). Moreover, the idea of worker’s power is discussed in the pluralist perspective: “openness and inclusion in which everyone is treated fairly and where everyone has an opportunity to contribute” (Boeing, 2016a, para. 3).\n\nRoss & Bamber (2009) state that a lot of organisations start “shifting ER further toward direct individualised relations between employers and their employees” and find such approach to be rather beneficial for the company’s stability and enhanced performance (p. 28). Labour unrest has an adverse influence on the company’s performance that is why Boeing should do its best to encourage the workers to cooperate and share its views and ideas (Kleiner, Leonard, & Pilarski, 2002).\n\nEven if Boeing does not provide its workers with additional benefits such as increased wages, it still has an opportunity to adapt organisational environment so that the employees become satisfied. Having more power and tightly cooperating with the management team, the members of the staff will work as one team regardless of them being representatives of the diverse population.\n\nThey can share their beliefs and ideas to solve organisational issues, reach mutual goals, and innovate. In this way, the implementation of the pluralist ER strategy and acting as partners with IAM will allow Boeing and its South Carolina plant to reach stability, prevent labour unrest and promote development.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of the Options\n\nER strategy made based on the unitarist ideas can have a range of advantages to Boeing and its plant located in South Carolina. First of all, it should be mentioned that it presupposes the integration of employer and employee interests. In this way, the workers have more opportunities to develop shared values, which will help them to improve commitment and loyalty.\n\nThe members of the staff are likely to become important stakeholders of Boeing so that the company will pay more attention to their needs and will do its best to provide them with everything needed. The unitarist ER strategy underlines the value of the management also. It encourages going beyond one’s leadership styles and emphasises the necessity of being convincing and influential. Moreover, it is considered that all stakeholders, including the employees, will do their best to find shared values and common interests (Ross & Bamber, 2009). Such a step can help the company to implement a stable ER system.\n\nStill, the unitarist ER strategy also has its negative sides. The most critical thing is that the leader and the workers are on different levels. Their powers are so diverse that different conflicts can be generated even in the framework of simple tasks and decisions (Guest, & Peccei, 2001). In this way, while the management has a right and a possibility to implement alterations in the organisation, schedule the work, etc.\n\nAt the same time, the workers are only able to accept the decision that was already made without their interference. As a result, the misbalance in powers can turn in a source of constantly occurring problems that will affect the performance of the plant and increase employee turnover. Except for that, unitarism has an extremely negative view of any conflicts. They all are considered to be a failure that cannot allow the organisation to reach adequate procedures while it can also be treated as a chance to find out what changes are required for improvement and how to reach the working harmony.\n\nIn the framework of the unitarist ER strategy, personal interests of every employee should be shared across the company. Even though such an event is likely to be beneficial because it cares about each worker, such alteration can be hardly reached. Generally, people have different views and interests. When working together, they try to focus on the organisational values and to believe in them. However, the range of organisational values is rather limited, and it is not focused on personal attributes while the unitary perspective tends to make one person absorb all characteristics of others (Edwards, 2003).\n\nThe unitarist perspective opposes any conflicts. On the one hand, it may be considered to be an advantage because teamwork requires efficient cooperation and harmony. Still, some conflicts may be helpful and their prohibition turns out to be an issue for the company. For example, when the conflict occurs when dividing the tasks, it can have a positive influence on the overall performance.\n\nThe members of the team will make sure that they are prepared to cope with the obtained tasks and can accomplish them decently. Moreover, according to the unitarist ideas the workers will be treated as significant stakeholders of Boeing. Of course, they are likely to consider such alteration as an advantage. However, it fails to align with the business strategy of the organisation, in the framework of which, the members of the staff are valued but perceived as a source of the opportunity to reduce expenditures. Thus, Boeing is not likely to undertake this ER strategy.\n\nExcept for the positive treatment of conflicts as an alternative decision-making process, pluralist theory presupposes a wider range of ER policies and motivate organisations to cooperate with the unions (Bacon & Blyton, 2007).\n\nIt allows the employees to realise that they are the vital element of the organisation, which encourages them to align personal interests with the company’s goals. Pluralism spreads diversity to the workforce and makes the employees more innovative and creative. It encourages teamwork and interaction with the management, which assists in the creation of a positive working environment, which has no labour issues (Badigannavar & Kelly, 2005).\n\nStill, pluralism cannot be adapted to the different workplace conditions and pay little attention to commercial interests, which is not likely to appeal to Boeing (Gennard & Judge, 2002). Of course, worker interest is valuable but the organisation requires decent income to remain competitive. However, the focus on clients and possibility to find a common language between the workers and the management team is likely to ensure that the ER based on the pluralist theory can help to resolve the most critical current issues faced by Boeing and its plant.\n\nConclusion\n\nThus, it can be concluded that Boeing must consider main ER strategies for the South Carolina plant, including unitarist and pluralist ones. Still, when thinking of the most beneficial strategy that aligns with the company’s business strategy and its values, the pluralist theory seems to be more appropriate. It is likely to allow the person to feel valued and respected. As the relationship with the management improve and the workers receive more power, they tend to be more motivated to work and enhance performance so that labour unrest will not be faced.\n\nThe diverse staff population will work in teams to deal with the occurred issues referring to innovative ideas, which will appeal to the customers. People will be working as a unity, which encourages to share different beliefs and ideas. Being led by managers through negotiation and supported by them, the workers will understand why they are working in a particular way and what should be done further. As a result, the company will regain its stability and streamline development.\n\nReferences\n\nBacon, N., & Blyton, P. (2007). Conflict for Mutual Gains?

      "Universities’ Recruitment Strategies Case Study\n\nIntroduction\n\nCompetition among public and private institutions is intensifying, and universities are no exception. With minimal support from governments, institutions of higher learning must market themselves as employers of choice. They ought to work on their image to increase enrollment rates and stakeholder satisfaction. Marketing an institution as an employer of choice not only has a significant effect on the nature of talent in the institution, but it also harms how other parties judge the institution.\n\nLinking recruitment strategies to organizational culture\n\nUniversities have realized that the working population has changed. Younger employees have different expectations from their employers. The older generation was quite loyal and would dedicate their professional careers to one institution. However, newer faculty have more options now, so they are less loyal than older workers. Employers have learned that proactive recruitment strategies are essential to survival. This means linking their recruitment efforts to organizational culture. Universities must now make a case for their corporate values through their recruitment efforts. This means having a focused message that conveys the university’s culture and identity compellingly. Companies now have a long term vision of the systems, values, and policies that define employee and employer expectations in the institution 1 .\n\nThe starting point in linking organizational culture with recruitment is making an inventory of the nature of candidates that the university wants to have. In this regard, institutional stakeholders need to decide on the values they expect applicants to possess. They should also determine what these potential employees want from a tertiary educational institution. Furthermore, a university should know the job search tools that these target workers use to find work. After determining the qualities of the applicants they want, universities then think about the process of application that candidates go through when getting to them. After that, they will examine the factors that make them an employer of choice. A self-analysis of the key strengths in the institution is imperative at this point. Usually, organizations get this information from workshops or interviews with employers and employees. Unless one can differentiate between perceived organizational value and real value, then branding and recruiting will be ineffective. The idea is to determine what the organizational culture in the university is like. After that, a firm must synergize its corporate brand with recruitment efforts. Recruitment styles ought to match the culture of the university as soon as employees enter the institution. In the internal environment, an organization can work on its orientation programs for new workers. It can also provide training for the newly employed as well as intranet services to faculty. Firms need to facilitate open communication with their workers to build a healthy organizational culture. This will have a bearing on recruitment endeavors, especially concerning championing the firm among potential applicants 2 .\n\nWhile many universities may demonstrate elements of the strategies mentioned above, it is obvious that not all of them succeed in their attempts. Those that do a poor job of linking organizational culture to recruitment are the ones that treat a recruitment effort as an ad campaign. If they merely focus on a cliché, then potential employees will not understand the culture, and they will not approach the institution. Furthermore, universities that do not practice what they market are likely to report poor outcomes. These institutions do not nurture their organizational culture by practicing what they promise. If applicants learn that a university does not have any of the programs that it markets in place, then future applications will reduce. Perhaps the most crucial cause of failure is the lack of a long term focus. When companies do not have a vision, then they are less likely to create a link between recruitment and retention among the masses.\n\nMarketing the organization\n\nSeveral institutions of higher learning are under pressure to market their organizations to potential employees. However, the pressure is even more intense for relatively unknown universities as they often bear the brunt of ambiguity and uncertainty about the institution. Some schools have utilized various external and internal features to differentiate themselves from their competitors in the field of tertiary education. For instance, some have used natural settings like location and proximity to landmark sites to market themselves. Others opt to focus on internal features that are attractive to employees and faculty members. The latter approaches are more effective than superficial features. 3\n\nBranding is a fundamental aspect of the marketing process. Here, tertiary institutions work on their logos, slogans, and brands to raise their profile. Many organizations now realize that it is not sufficient to have the same branding strategy for decades on end. Instead, a number of them may engage in rebranding exercises. They attempt to furnish the masses with information about the university and its relevance as an employer of choice. Not all tertiary education bodies are always successful at achieving this. When all the members of a university do not understand the essence of a branding strategy, then it is likely that they may fail in marketing themselves as employers of choice. Their representatives will send mixed messages to the recruitment pool, and this could backfire on them. The extent to which an organization incorporates various members in branding also affects outcomes. Those that view rebranding and branding as HR reserves will not have sufficient support to make their marketing efforts successful. 4\n\nWhen marketing an organization, a company needs to highlight how it is a suitable environment for innovators. For instance, the university may talk about the level of support it gives to game changers and innovators. It may also foster pride in the institution as a place that differs from competitors. The idea is to make an organizational culture so valuable to employees that they will be willing to refer other employees to the institution. These universities use their existing employees as referral markets by keeping their promises and creating a conducive work environment. During these referral programs, employees can share stores about their experiences at the university and thus offer information that would have been hard to find using other platforms.\n\nIt should be noted that leaving the referral program entirely in the hands of employees could be detrimental to a university. An organization can formalize the referral program by training its workers and teaching them ways of sending compelling messages to target audiences. They can show them key communication channels and support for using those platforms. Universities should also give information concerning how well their management exhibits leaders or how it motivates workers.\n\nBudgetary constraints in public universities limit the number of financial incentives they can promise their applicants. As a result, many of them may be perceived as uncompetitive when compared to the private sector. To counteract this negative image, universities often focus on other reward mechanisms such as pension, life and health insurance, career development as well as opportunities for training and development. The younger generation is highly interested in the concept of work-life balance, so universities are in a unique position to take advantage of this need. 5\n\nStrategies and initiatives to attract applicants\n\nUniversities are quite fond of job fairs as a strategy for attracting applicants. They may also use other events to show job seekers that they are an institution of choice. In these scenarios, the firms will talk about the perks and rewards that come with working for them. They will also mention other non-monetary benefits of working for the institution, such as access to sufficient teaching aids and information for the classroom. Job fairs often allow university officials to interact with job seekers and respond to questions that they may have about the organizations. These sometimes work in their favor, although they usually apply to graduates and lower-level faculty.\n\nUniversities also make advertisements for a recruitment effort. In this regard, they will inform the public about a vacancy, the qualifications, and experience needed to secure the job. Most may use local newspapers for this purpose. The main advantage of such an approach is that it reaches a wide pool of applicants. On the flip side, it is not a targeted strategy, so it could attract a vast pool of unskilled or unwanted job applicants.\n\nFurthermore, advertising, when done plainly, could not differentiate a university as a place of choice. It often focuses on what employers can bring to the university rather than what the institution can do for them. Pragmatic institutions take the time to outline what employees could gain if they select the university as a place of choice.\n\nTechnology has become a vital player in employer branding within tertiary educational institutions. Companies now communicate with potential employees through blogs, social media, and recruitment websites. It is possible to offer in-depth and unbiased information about a tertiary institution through a blog or social media. Here, visitors would have the opportunity to talk about their experiences as employees in the company. Potential applicants are more likely to believe information from third parties than what is available on company websites. Continuous engagement with the labor pool can go a long way in marketing an institution as the employer of choice. Firms also have the option of building an internet presence through the use of cutting-edge technology. In this regard, they can talk about programs or people management practices at their university. The websites should also facilitate dialogue between the employer and the employee. In certain respects, this will work by providing those who need information about the institution directly from the horse’s mouth. 6\n\nSometimes internship programs are unique opportunities for universities to access the right pool of workers. Many final year students may choose to do an internship at an institution. Tertiary bodies have the option of building an image amongst these potential applicants in a direct way. They can give them a taste of what is to come by treating them fairly and supporting them. While private institutions get their interns from external firms, universities often use their students. As a result, potential employees assess them with greater scrutiny than external interns. This means that tertiary educational entities must be as transparent as possible during the internship.\n\nNot all university vacancies are filled are the same rate. Some specialized courses have a scarcity of applicants. To attract and retain applicants, some learning bodies have created partnerships with other learning bodies to facilitate sharing between different institutions. For example, it is possible to find that one professor in nuclear physics teaches students in various universities. Conversely, some institutions of higher learning may suffer from an abundance of candidates with the same skills. In this regard, they can make trade-offs with other institutions that do not have those surpluses. 7\n\nHow organizations measure the effect of branding and recruitment exercises\n\nIf branding and recruitment exercises are effective, then universities ought to report changes in their human resource pool. First, they ought to attract applicants with the right skill sets. If they want to know whether an employer branding exercise has been successful, then they must measure the number of rightly-skilled candidates in their applicant pool. Additionally, employee retention testifies to an organizations’ status as an employer of choice. When workers are satisfied with their institutions, then they are likely to stay loyal. Therefore, tertiary education institutions also measure turnover rates after employer branding. If the record decreases in turnover rates, then recruitment efforts were effective. However, if the opposite occurs, then they must reorganize and change their branding strategies. In some circumstances, they can measure the number of workers that complete their probation periods. For these measures to work well, then companies need to have baseline goals which they must aspire towards before branding. After a branding exercise, they can then evaluate the figures based on the goals they set. For instance, a company can decide to reduce its turnover rates by 5% by the end of its employer branding exercise. Turnover rates may also be measured through the vacancy rates within a university. Alternatively, it could decide to increase the number of skilled faculty by 10%. These are all percentages and targets that must be selected realistically and appropriately. 8\n\nSpecific measures may also be essential in demonstrating the success of recruitment efforts immediately after branding. For instance, a university can assess the degree of employee satisfaction shortly after hiring them. Alternatively, it may measure the flow of applicants that come into the university whenever they announce an opening. In certain circumstances, they can use financial parameters to assess these outcomes. For instance, they may measure the cost of bringing each applicant and compare it to overall figures before the rebranding exercise. Many experts caution organizations about the financial approach because cost savings may come at the expense of quality improvements. Additionally, short term gains may mitigate the long term benefits of higher employee retention as well as greater faculty satisfaction.\n\nThe time it takes for an organization to hire its employees also indicates the relative success or failure of the branding and recruitment experience. If recruitment lags on for months, then the chances are that the company did not achieve its goals. It may achieve this by measuring average hiring times and comparing them with time-to-hire after a branding strategy. 9\n\nCertain firms may use technology as a resource for measuring branding effects. If the level of media exposure is high, then the chances are that more people will want to work for the institution, and this will be a successful endeavor. One way of assessing the extent of media exposure is through placement on best-places-to-work websites. Many industries, companies or analysts have created websites in which they list the best places to work in their area of concern. Therefore, if a company has done relatively successfully in this parameter, it may consider analyzing the extent to which it has risen the ranks. For instance, if it was position 23 before employer branding, it may aspire towards position ten after the exercise. However, universities must be careful about this parameter because not all of them are capable of making it to the lists. Only those organizations that have already featured in these lists can successfully use them. It can be quite frustrating if a university continually aspires to be in the top 50 employers list but never gets there. Factors like size and length of existence of the university affect how well websites respond to them. 10\n\nConclusion\n\nIn these highly competitive times, universities must be proactive about their recruitment endeavors. First, they need to create an organizational culture that fosters employee loyalty and causes potential applicants to perceive the university as an employer of choice. Successful firms also foster communication and offer applicants rewards that are not just monetary. Perhaps the most effective approach to recruitment as a strategy is thinking of it as a long term endeavor and having visions and objectives to work towards.\n\nBibliography\n\nBoudreau, John and Peter Ramstad.

      "Greenway Hotel’s Germany Expansion Strategy Case Study\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper reports about the cultural differences between Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K) instead of an attempt by a UK-based hotel (Greenway Hotel Group) to venture into the German hospitality industry. The case study highlights different cultural issues related to the hotel’s global expansion strategy, including the language differences that exist between the two European countries, the implications of the cultural differences for the hotel, and the recommendations that the hotel could consider to minimize the negative impact of cultural diversity or maximize the hotel’s potential in harnessing the same. This report uses Hall’s theory of high-context and low-context cultural frameworks and Hofstede’s cultural dimension theory to explain these differences.\n\nCultural Differences between the U.K and Germany\n\nThe U.K and Germany have unique cultural differences that may affect Greenway’s expansion plans on the German market. Hall’s theory of high and low context cultures helps us to understand these differences because it provides a framework for understanding the cultural extremes of different societies (Liu 20).\n\nHall’s theory\n\nHall presents cultural differences between different groups as either being high-context or low-context (Liu 20). He uses people’s closeness within different cultural orientations to explain these differences (Djursaa 140). High-context cultures often emerge in societies where people share close relationships with their neighbors or acquaintances. Such types of cultures often cater to the needs of in-groups. People who subscribe to them base their business relationships on the same social relationships (Liu 20). Similarly, in these types of cultures, businesspersons often share information and knowledge among acquaintances and prefer to do business with people who are part of these groups (Djursaa 140).\n\nComparatively, low-context cultures cater to the needs of out-groups. Such cultures are prevalent in highly individualistic societies, such as America and the U.K (Djursaa 140). Here, people share business information and knowledge less exclusively. Similarly, businesspersons do not necessarily prefer to collaborate with people that they know or understand (Liu 20). The high and low context cultural frameworks emerge as useful tools for understanding the cultural differences between the U.K and Germany, where Greenway Hotel intends to concentrate its market expansion strategy. This section of the report shows that time and language are the most common differences that Greenway needs to consider in its international expansion strategy.\n\nTime\n\nWe can evaluate the cultural differences between Germany and the U.K by understanding the orientations of time between the two countries. Monochronic and polychronic time orientations outline the two main criteria for doing so. Monochronic people tend to do one thing at a time by concentrating on one task (Greenberg 4). Comparatively, polychronic people undertake many things at once and prefer to focus on events that happen around them, as opposed to those that are set to occur before them (Greenberg 4). The UK is a polychronic country, while Germany is a monochronic country.\n\nLanguage\n\nMost businesses stand to benefit from the advantages of effective communication between partners (Clipa 10-11). Although every culture has its unique communication style, the most important aspect of this information exchange is language. The UK and Germany speak different languages because the British speak English, while the Germans speak German. Most people know the British to be a high-context group of people because, when communicating, they spend a lot of time “beating around the bush” instead of getting to the point (Greenberg 4). The British believe that getting straight to the point is often “rude” and would prefer to engage in “small talk” before doing so (Djursaa 141-143).\n\nLiu (21) believes that in this cultural framework, the British expect people to be intelligent enough to understand the discourse from the context of the discussion. If they encounter a person who gets directly to the point, they might think the person undermines them (Liu 21). Comparatively, the Germans are “straight shooters” because they talk about business without engaging in many diversionary conversation tactics (GIZ 64). When doing so, the Germans also like to express their views more directly than the British would do (GIZ 64). These language differences show high potential for miscommunication between the British and the German workers.\n\nHofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Theory\n\nHofstede’s theory outlines a framework for understanding cross-cultural communication by evaluating different cultural dynamics in different societies. The theory highlights six cultural contexts for evaluating cross-cultural communication. They include individualism, power distance, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation and indulgence (The Hofstede Center 1). These dimensions represent independent preferences for interaction among different countries, as opposed to individuals. The following section of this paper explains the meaning of these sets of cultural dimensions and the performance of the UK and Germany in the same regard.\n\nPower Distance Index (PDI)\n\nThe PDI refers to the degree that most members of a society accept that power distribution occurs equally or unequally. Countries that have a high power distance often accept hierarchical power structures in their organizations, while those that have a low power distance adopt democratic leadership styles (The Hofstede Center 1). Both the UK and Germany have a low power distance index (GIZ 64).\n\nIndividualism\n\nAn individualistic culture is prevalent in societies where people are mostly concerned about their wellbeing, as opposed to the wellbeing of others (The Hofstede Center 3). In a collectivist culture, people are mostly concerned about the wellbeing of the majority and the influence of individual actions on the masses. The UK has a high individualism index, while Germany has a moderate individualism index (Greenberg 3).\n\nMasculinity\n\nMasculine cultures value achievement, heroism, and assertiveness as the dominant traits in organizational leadership, while feminine-oriented cultures value cooperation and modesty as the dominant traits that characterize leadership (The Hofstede Center 4). Both the UK and Germany have a moderate masculinity index (Greenberg 3).\n\nUncertainty Avoidance Index\n\nThis cultural dimension refers to the risk appetite levels in a country. Countries that have a high uncertainty avoidance index often have a low-risk appetite index, while those that have a high uncertainty avoidance index have a high-risk appetite (The Hofstede Center 3). The UK has a low uncertainty avoidance index, while Germany has a moderate uncertainty avoidance index (GIZ 64).\n\nPragmatism\n\nCountries that have a high pragmatism index are often long-term oriented and tend to accept change better than countries, which have a low pragmatism index because they are often short-term oriented and perceive change suspiciously (The Hofstede Center 3). The UK has a moderate pragmatism index, while Germany has a high pragmatism index (Greenberg 3).\n\nIndulgence\n\nHighly indulgent societies often accept the pursuit of human gratification and desires. Similarly, they encourage people to have fun and enjoy life. Comparatively, countries that score low on the indulgence index suppress gratification or the pursuit of human desires through the implementation of strict cultural norms (The Hofstede Center 3). The UK has a high indulgence index, while Germany has a low indulgence index (GIZ 64).\n\nImplications of the Cultural Differences for Greenway’s HR Practices\n\nThis paper has affirmed the presence of significant cultural differences between the U.K and German businesspersons. These cultural differences have different implications for the H.R practices of Greenway Hotel as it ponders on understanding the best market entry strategy to use in its international expansion strategy. The implications of the cultural diversity issues on the organization appear below\n\nHofstede Cultural Dimensions\n\nManagement Style\n\nBased on the cultural differences between Germany and the U.K, Greenway needs to employ flexible managers that have vast experience in international businesses. The managers need to be flexible enough to accommodate the varying cultural dynamics of operating in a multicultural context. By extension, the cultural differences between the U.K and Germany would affect the recruitment practices of Greenway Hotel because the organization needs to have a robust recruitment plan that would attract culturally competent managers (Pathak 13).\n\nMore Rules\n\nThe high regard for rules and the lack of risk-taking in the UK culture could make employees more unwilling to take responsibility for their actions and become more resistant to change. It could also lead to the creation of more ritualistic behaviors in the organization (Pathak 13).\n\nIndividual Achievement\n\nThe focus on individualism in the German and UK cultures could lead to the creation of an “I” mentality at Greenway Hotel. It could also lead to an increased focus on independence among the hotel’s workers, as opposed to dependence on each other, thereby affecting different HR functions such as compensation and teamwork (Pathak 14).\n\nGroup Achievement\n\nIncreased emphasis on group achievement could make employees highly dependent on the organization because many employees will expect the organization to take care of them. This culture could undermine competition, which should lead to the improvement of the hotel’s services because the employees’ focus would be on cooperation, as opposed to healthy competition.\n\nPragmatism\n\nCultures that have a low-risk appetite are likely to be less innovative than their counterparts who have a high-risk appetite. Furthermore, these companies are likely to be more resistant to change and impede the organization’s development (The Hofstede Center 3).\n\nIndulgence\n\nHighly indulgent cultures are likely to see their employees demand more salaries and wages compared to those that do not subscribe to this culture. However, such employees are also likely to enjoy their jobs more than those who have restraint (Clipa 10-11).\n\nRestraint\n\nIncreased restraint in the organization is likely to diminish the emphasis on leisure activities. While societies that accept this culture may not experience changes in productivity, hopelessness, stress, and reduced activity are possible outcomes in the corporate space (Clipa 10-11).\n\nHigh-Context (British) vs. Low-Context (German) Cultures\n\nTime\n\nThis paper has already shown that the UK is a polychromic country and Germany is a monochromic country. The implication of this difference is the possibility that the British could often change meeting schedules regularly, thereby making it difficult for the German workers to follow what they want. This outcome could create unpleasant vibes between the two groups of workers (GIZ 64).\n\nLanguage\n\nThe language differences between the Germans and the British could make the latter find the communication style of the Germans offensively blunt. Comparatively, the tendency by the British to “beat around the bush” could make the Germans think they are secretive and untrustworthy. Moreover, since Germans have a direct communication style, the British could think they are insulting their intelligence for stating obvious facts. Comparatively, the Germans could misunderstand the British leadership style to be ineffective and unable to provide direction (Clipa 10-11)\n\nRecommendations to Minimize Cultural Impact\n\nWhile diversity may be an operational problem for many organizations that want to adopt successful globalization strategies, companies that learn how to manage this issue could benefit from addressing the problem and outwit their competitors in the same regard (Greenberg 3).\n\nThe purpose of managing diversity is to bring out the best in employees and, by extension, an organization. Although there are different strategies that different organizations could use to manage culture, Greenway Hotel should ask fundamental questions about this process, such as what key practices, beliefs, and processes would cause discontentment among Germans (about the organization’s practices) and what organizational (HR) practices could forge cohesion among employees? Similarly, it should ponder about which organizational changes it could undertake to accommodate employees of a diverse cultural background. This section of the report shows different strategies the hotel should consider if it wants to manage cultural diversity in the organization.\n\nHofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Theory\n\nUncertainty Avoidance\n\nThe management should have a precise and direct organization of the company’s operational processes so that everybody understands the direction that the organization should follow. By understanding this direction, employees would better understand which risks to take and which ones to avoid (Liu 21).\n\nIndividualism\n\nTo overcome some of the challenges that could emerge from an individualistic culture, the managers of Greenway Hotel should allow open discussion among employees and provide a clear vision and mission statement for the company. This way, the workers would understand which behavioral practices to avoid and which ones to promote. The management should also design organizational tasks in ways that allow it to give credit to teams as opposed to individuals (Liu 21).\n\nPragmatism\n\nNavigating issues of pragmatism requires managers to set and communicate the long-term goal of the company. The team should also motivate employees with long-term rewards, as opposed to short-term rewards, to introduce a new focus in the organization where employees appreciate long-term success, as opposed to short-term accomplishments (Greenberg 5).\n\nIndulgence\n\nManaging indulgence issues of Greenway Hotel requires the hotel’s managers to set up company rules and policies that align with the organizational goals and require each employee to follow them (Greenberg 5).\n\nHigh Context (British) vs. Low-Context (German) Cultures\n\nManaging the cultural differences between the UK’s high-context and Germany’s low-context cultures requires Greenway’s managers to practice effective time management strategies to make sure no disagreements arise from different perceptions of time. Similarly, they need to recruit an interpreter to manage language issues between employees from both sets of cultures. They also need to provide language training for all employees and ensure that effective communication takes place among workers. Lastly, all communications within the company should be in German and English to prevent miscommunication among workers.\n\nInternationalization Strategy and Timeline\n\nPerlmutter (1-3) proposes three internationalization strategies, which are ethnocentric, polycentric, and geocentric. The ethnocentric approach is home-based because managers are from the parent country and the company’s policies are from the same location (Perlmutter 4). The polycentric approach is host-country oriented, as the company’s managers and policies suit the host location (Perlmutter 5).\n\nLastly, the geocentric approach does not have a cultural or nationalistic bias. It looks for the best manager, or policy, to use in a new country. Greenway Hotel has chosen the ethnocentric approach. However, this strategy could not work at Greenway because it would breed conflict. Instead, the hotel should adopt the geocentric approach because it is democratic and would accommodate the cultural diversity of the Germans and the British. The timeline for implementing the HR plan appears below.\n\nConclusion\n\nCultural diversity is an important topic in global business because it defines the success, or failure, of international businesses. Greenway’s market expansion from the U.K to German is not different. The company needs to consider the impact of cultural diversity in its workplace plans. This paper has used Hall’s 1976 framework of contextual cultural factors and Hofstede’s theory of cultural dimensions to show that Germany and the U.K stand in different positions of the high-context and low-context continuum of cultural differences.\n\nGermany is a low-context culture because people are more individualistic, while the U.K is a high-context culture because its business styles are “communal.” This report has explained these differences through the varied communication and relational attributes of the U.K and German people. It has also shown that these differences are bound to affect Greenway’s H.R practices through their effects on the company’s management styles and employee perceptions.\n\nIf unattended, they are likely to affect teamwork and group cohesion among employees. Furthermore, employees are bound to be suspicious of one another and fail to provide the synchrony that Greenway needs as it ventures internationally. The varying cultural dynamics of the two groups are also bound to be problematic for the hotel’s management as it formulates a workable leadership/management strategy that both sets of the employees would respect. To overcome some of the diversity issues that may arise in Greenway’s market expansion strategy, and to minimize them, it is pertinent to adopt some of the recommendations highlighted in this paper. Comprehensively, the managers of Greenway Hotel should adopt an open leadership structure that accommodates the views of everybody in the organization, as opposed to confining the decision-making process to U.K managers and reducing the German counterparts to implement what managers have decided.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nClipa, Flavian. “Cultural Diversity and Human Resource Management in Multinational Companies.” Ces Working Papers 1.1 (2009): 10-16.

      "The Equal Allocation of Risks in Public Contracts Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Background Information\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Bibliography\n 5. Footnotes\n\nIntroduction\n\nGovernments and public institutions all over the world have used public-private cooperation to develop public projects. A public-private partnership model has brought numerous benefits in the design, implementation and completion of public projects. 1 Projects under a public-private partnership can benefit from the facilitative capacity of public institutions as well as from their efficiency capacity. 2 One of the most critical issues challenging the cooperation between the public sector and public institutions in developing public projects is the sharing of future risks. Because of their huge size and high public expectations, public projects will frequently face multiple bottlenecks which may become the future risks in the result. In the direction of trying to solve disputes between private and public institutions, FIDIC has been developing documentation that would be helpful for guiding the sharing of risks between public institutions and private firms. 3\n\nBackground Information\n\nIn 1914, the International Federation of Consulting Engineers and the International Federation of Housing and Public opened their first offices in Switzerland. These two federations then published the first edition of the FIDIC contracts in 1957. The members of the FIDIC association include professional consulting organizations from 25 European nations. FIDIC has gained an international outlook after engineering consulting associations from America and Asia joined the umbrella. 4 Because of a range of professional standards present in the FIDIC contracts, the World Bank has now proposed to only fund the international projects that adhere to the standards of the FIDIC contracts. After publishing the first suite of contracts in 1957, FIDIC has published several amended editions. Experience has contributed to the amendment of the proceeding FIDIC editions. 5 Most of the current international projects in developed countries (such as European nations) follow the 1999 FIDIC edition suite. The 1999 FIDIC suite distributes more risks to the developer than the previous editions did. 6 On the other hand, developing nations find the 1987 FIDIC edition more suitable than the previous ones due to their environment development. 7 Such a direction could arise due to the high level of political risk that was present in many developing nations; hence, a need to share risks more equally between the employer and the developer has appeared.\n\nThe 1999 FIDIC edition has four model scenarios for sharing risks between the employer and the contractor. The condition for contract book (red book) has laid out procedures for procurement as well as the construction of guideline contract. Here, the developer is responsible for preparing the project work, while the contractor should execute the project according to guidelines. The condition of contract for the design of plants (also called yellow book) is for guiding installation of engineering projects. The silver book is useful for guiding factory and power plant projects. The green book is applicable to different forms of small engineering projects that do not necessarily require the supervisory services of a consulting engineer. 8 Project that can be referred to a green book contract is a short term project that requires completion within six months. The FIDIC red book has two main parts. The main section of the red book contains a list of general principles that should be included in project contracts. The special principles’ section of the red book contains a list of procedures for guiding the creation of guidelines that are unique to the project environment. Special principles must align with the provisions of the general principles. 9\n\nThe European Institute of Contractors recommends that standard contracts, such as the FIDIC ones that distribute risks equally in key areas, would be used in projects that require the funding of international banks. The most important areas that need a balanced system of risk allocation between the employer and the contractor include obstructions, design, payment methods, certification and procurement. The silver book volume of the 1999 FIDIC contracts deviates slightly from the previous editions of the FIDIC suites by unequally distributing risks between the employer and the contractor. 10 As such, the silver book of the 1999 FIDIC edition is useful in designing international contracts. In view of the above limitations, the EIC has embarked on an effort of publishing the provisions and shortcomings of standard contracts, such as the FIDIC ones. 11\n\nDue to inevitable circumstances, which could lead to future disputes between the employer and contractor, standard contracts (such as the FIDIC) have a mechanism that can be applied for dispute resolution purposes. Here, dispute boards and international arbitrator associations should be used to address arising disputes between the contractor and the employer. The need for international arbitration should not be limited to the agreement of a controlling body in a given country. The main bottleneck against the use of international arbitration mechanisms in resolving contract disputes is that many international engineering firms have not ratified the 1958 New York Convention on arbitration. 12 From most of those that have ratified the New York convention, they do not recognize its provisions. 13 Therefore, the capacity of International arbitration mechanisms to solve contract disputes remains limited.\n\nThe main challenges that have contributed to disputes between the employer and the contractor in contract agreements resulted from the possibility of varying the specific conditions in the FIDIC contracts to make amendments that would alter the general provisions. As such, FIDIC has emphasized the need to use the specific conditions on matters that relate to the regulation of a project in accordance with unique provisions that are present in a given country. 14 Specific conditions should only relate to matters specific in a given country, such as the social and the economic environments and geological peculiarities. 15 Specific conditions are not designed for creating loopholes that would allow the re-allocation of risks apart from what is provided for in the general conditions. The EIC has warned international banks against funding projects that have such loopholes as those mentioned above. Moreover, the EIC has prohibited a contracting body from disqualifying a tender bid founded on the assumption that risk deviations are disallowed. Generally, the EIC requires contracts to be completed according to the FIDIC standards. Besides, contracts must be fair to both the parties; hence, they need not to allocate risks to the contractors that arise from such parameters like liquidation risks.\n\nWhile commenting on the first edition (1957) of the FIDIC contracts, Julius Triton, the founding president of FIDIC, noted that the purpose of the organisation was to create a framework for equally allocating risks between the employer and the contractor. Thus, the FIDIC contracts are designed to protect the employer as well as the contractor. Succeeding editions of the FIDIC contracts follow an approach of detailing general and specific conditions for regulating projects. Fundamental provisions on the procedure of regulating a project by the employer are provided for in the general conditions section. The special conditions allow for modifications that can fit a project in the context of unique environments where a given project runs. As observed, specific conditions can only be altered in accordance with the general provisions and should not deviate from the initial distribution of risks in the general conditions. 16 A number of clauses in the FIDIC suite can be altered, while given clauses are to be constructed in accordance with the project work. There is even a provision for amending some sections of the general provisions although such an amendment is not about the risks re-distribution apart from what was initially agreed upon by employer, consulting engineer and developer. 17\n\nThe purpose of the FIDIC contracts is to guide and advice the relationship of the employer and the contractor during the project work. The FIDIC contracts do not establish any legal liability on any of the participating parties in a project; thus, the employer should draw a legal contract that that will legally bind the parties. While drawing up a legal contract, it is common for participating parties to make a number of amendments and new provisions. As such, if the contract is based on the agreement between individual representing a legal entity and contractor, a public institution for which a specific individual approves all the changes in the original agreement. The FIDIC contracts contain clauses that allow for the alteration of works by the consulting engineer. Here, the contractor is obliged to meet new requirements in the project works as the engineer may recommend.\n\nGenerally, the FIDIC suite of contracts is useful in creating a framework that balances the allocation of risks between the employer and the contractor. The FIDIC suite of contracts assigns clear responsibilities and obligations to the contractor and the employer. Failure to play on the part of any party to meet the set demands will result in the shifting a risk balance between the contractor and the employer. Due to their large scale nature and high public expectation, many public projects frequently result in disputes. Failure to reach an agreement through arbitration mechanism will often result in a legal litigation. The understanding of laws’ implementation regulating how risk allocation aligns with delay, disruption and quality is essential in solving legal disputes that originate from public projects. 18\n\nIn a case between the government of the United States and Schnip building, the contractor had encountered a set of different conditions specified in the contract. 19 After incurring additional costs, the contractor sued for an increment in the price of the contract. The claim for an increase in price of the contract was dismissed on the ground that the contractor had not given a written 20-day notice to the government of the USA detailing the encounter of the conditions different from those that had been specified in the contract. A 20-day notice is among the main requirements needed for complaint award. Fru-con Corporation was also denied a claim for an increase in contract costs due to failure on its part to inform the United States government about changes in weather. 20\n\nThe use of float time and critical paths is among the methodologies used to evaluate project disruptions and delays. Float time is the amount of time in which a project can exceed the earliest date of completion without delay in the overall schedule of project completion. However, according to the understanding of many governments, float time is only for the purposes of the government/employer’s benefits. On the other hand, a critical path is a set of related activities in a long list of sequence to complete a project. Delays and disruptions are often argued based on the definitions of float time and critical paths. Here, it is important to note that since it affects the sequence path of a project, a disruption can directly affect float time. In case of Santa Corporation, the US government was not obliged to pay for damages despite a float provision since the claimant could not prove that the actions of the US government had led to the disruptions. 21\n\nConclusion\n\nThe equal sharing of risks between public institutions and contractors is necessary for effective implementation of public projects. Aligning national projects with the international contracting standards, many governments and international forms base their contracts on the FIDIC contracts’ standards. The use of mechanisms that prevent an alteration risk balance is among the most useful approaches in preventing the exploitation of contracting parties facilitated by the FIDIC contracts. In the direction of trying to solve disputes between private and public institutions, FIDIC has been developing documentations to guide risks sharing between public and private organisations. Generally, the FIDIC contracts have laid a foundation that can help to design contracts that equally allocate risks between the parties involved.\n\nBibliography\n\nAbednego, M. “Good project governance for proper risk allocation in public-private Partnerships in Indonesia” Manage , vol. 8, no. 2, 2007, pp. 622–634\n\nChen, C. “BOT application in China: Driving and Impeding factors” Manage , vol. 10, no. 2, 2008, pp. 388–398.\n\nLam, K. “Modelling risk allocation decision in construction contracts” Manage.

      "Market Basket Company Information Proposal Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Market Basket: Description\n 2. Sources\n 3. Analysis Proposal\n 4. Works Cited\n\nMarket Basket: Description\n\nMarket Basket, Inc. is a private company founded in 1917 by two brothers, George and Telemachus Demoulas (“DeMoulas / Market Basket Inc.” par. 2-6). The company had been split by a family feud since the 1990s and until 2014 (Ross par. 1; “DeMoulas / Market Basket Inc.” par. 2-17). In June 2014, the feud led to the replacement of the company’s CEO Arthur T. Demoulas, who was restored to the position one month later as a result of a boycott that was organized by the stakeholders (Mochari par. 1-2). The former rival of the current CEO (and his cousin) Arthur S. Demoulas together with his family agreed to sell their share to Arthur T. Demoulas the same year (“America’s Largest Private Companies” par. 1).\n\nMarket Basket, Inc. is owned by Demoulas Super Markets, Inc. (ticker symbol DEMMARP) that is currently headquartered in Tewksbury, Massachusetts (“Demoulas Super Markets, Inc.” par. 1-2). According to Forbes’ “America’s Largest Private Companies” rating, Market Basket, Inc. is ranked #116 with $3.7 billion revenue and 20 000 employees (par. 1). The company operates a “chain of grocery stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine”; the expansion to Maine began in 2014 (“Company Overview of Market Basket, Inc.” par. 1; “About DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc.” par. 3).\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the company has opened two new stores the number of which is now seventy-five (“Demoulas Super Markets 2015” par. 1; “My Demoulas” par. 2). It may be, therefore, concluded that Market Basket, Inc. intends to expand. The competitors of the company include “Big Y Foods, Inc., Hannaford Supermarkets, Shaws Supermarkets”, “Star Markets Company, Stop and Shop Supermarket Co., Trader Joe’s Company, and Whole Foods Market, Inc.” (“Demoulas Super Markets” par. 3; “Demoulas Super Markets, Inc.” par. 4).\n\nSources\n\nThe sources that can contain some information concerning the company’s performance include Forbes and Bloomberg Business. The same websites can provide articles and reviews concerning the company’s policies. Websites like Hoover’s, Supermarket News and PrivCo provide a limited amount of information for free and consistent reports for a fee. As for the information concerning the company’s mission, vision, and policies, it can be attained from the company’s website as well as from various press releases and articles in general and specialized magazines, for example, Inc.com or Boston Globe.\n\nAnalysis Proposal\n\nTo provide a report concerning the past, current and future performance of Market Basket, Inc., it would be advisable to start with the company’s background that can be found on the company’s website as well as other business websites. After that, the current financial data should be gathered, even though a significant part of it does not appear to be in public access. Still, the mentioned websites may provide information that would be enough to draw conclusions concerning the company’s current and future performance. Apart from that, the company’s policies should be taken into account as well as the social, political, and environmental factors that could influence the future of the company.\n\nThe issue of the family feud and the impact that it has had on the company’s performance and reputation should probably be included in the report as well. Apart from that, it seems that the CEO is a very influential figure, which means that his personality and contribution could also be described. The structure of the company could also be defined, and its relationship with the owner company, Demoulas Super Markets, Inc, should be dwelled on.\n\nUpon gathering and analyzing the mentioned information, a consistent picture of the company’s past and current performance and strategy can be made, assessed, and interpreted.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“ About DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. ” Vault.com .

      "Arab League and US in Israel-Palestine Conflict Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Hamas vs Fatah\n 3. How Can Arab League Help\n 4. Reasons for U.S. to Stop Supporting Israel\n 5. Why Should Israel Leave Palestine\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be compared to the conflict of two different people, two groups of identity, each of which wants to claim the same territory as the national land and the political state. In a conflict like this, the identity alongside the existence of the ‘enemy’ are a thread I the identity and the existence of each of the groups. “The other’s identity and its associated narrative challenge the group’s claims of ownership – at least to exclusive ownership – of the land and its resources” (Kelman 2007, p. 287).\n\nHamas vs Fatah\n\nAs the world put an emphasis on the peace process to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, the division between Hamas and Fatah still remains unnoticed. The worldwide community thinks that the political and the economic sanctions on Hamas will minimize the conflict (Brown 2010, p. 36). However, the solution to the conflict is not the destruction of the two rival groups. According to Lieut, Gen. Michael Flynn, a top Pentagon Official, “the destruction of Palestinian militant group Hamas will not solve, and might even intensify, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict” (cited in Fitsanakis 2014, para. 1). The solution to every conflict is always negotiations in which both the United States of America and the Arab League can aid.\n\nHow Can Arab League Help\n\nThe role of the Arab League in the conflict is engaging every side into a dialogue and offering a compromise without reviving any further crisis and conflict (Hitti 2013, para. 10). The challenge of Saudi Arabian King Abdullah to solve the Mideast conflict became a catalyst for further actions of the League. King Abdullah underlined the importance of a peaceful conflict resolution and noted, “In injured Palestine, the people are still resolute, while suffering occupation and repression, and are deprived of their rights to independence and a sovereign state” (cited in Hanley 2007, para. 9). He insisted on putting an end to the conflict as well as ending the sanctions put on Israel.\n\nReasons for U.S. to Stop Supporting Israel\n\nThere is a number of reasons why the U.S. government should stop supporting Israel in the conflict. These reasons include the harm of the U.S. military aid for the population of Israel that must spend their tax funds on strengthening the military establishment instead of improving the social situation. Secondly, the fact that Israel illegally occupies Palestine is another reason for not supporting Israel. Thirdly, Israel constantly violates human rights of the Palestinian Population in the occupied territories that contradicts the U.S. Constitution ( Top Ten Reasons to Oppose U.S. Aid to Israel n.d., para. 6). The Arab League should put a strong pressure on the U.S. government to stop helping Israel. As the help stops, the conflict will start to minimize because of the lack of military resources, causing Israel and Palestine to begin negotiations.\n\nWhy Should Israel Leave Palestine\n\nThe above-listed reasons for the U.S. to stop helping Israel are also applicable to the question of why Israel must leave Palestine. For instance, the Israeli abuse of human rights of the occupied populations normalizes the violation of human rights. Moreover, the Israeli leaders took participation in training other abusive regimens, like, for instance, a Honduran military intelligence unit that terrorized the peaceful population. To further complicate the situation, Israel trained the South African hit squads that aimed at destroying ANC leaders ( Top Ten Reasons to Oppose U.S. Aid to Israel n.d., para. 9).\n\nReferences\n\nBrown, N 2010, ‘The Hamas-Fatah Conflict: Shallow but Wide’, The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, vol. 34, no. 2, pp. 35-49.\n\nFitsanakis, J 2014, Destroying Hamans Won’t Solve Conflict, Says Top US Pentagon Official , Web.\n\nHanley, D 2007, Saudi Arabian King Abdullah Challenges Arab League to Solve Mideast Co nflicts , Web.\n\nHitti, N 2013, How the Arab League Can Help Israel, Palestine Negotiate , Web.\n\nKelman, H 2007, ‘The Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process and Its Vicissitudes.

      "Mi’kmaq and Saudi Cultures Comparison Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost countries differentiate themselves from others by the unique culture they possess. By definition, culture is the shared characteristics of a group and it provides a common identity for the group members. Two countries that have groups of people with different cultures are Canada and Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, the Arab inhabitants of the country have a unique and rich culture. In Canada, the First Nation tribe of the Mi’kmaq has a distinctive culture. This paper will set out to compare the culture of the Arab Saudis with that of the Canadian Mi’kmaq. It will highlight the differences and similarities between the two in order to promote a better understanding of these cultures.\n\nHistorical Overview of the Mi’kmaq and the Saudis\n\nSaudi Arabia is a Middle East Arab country that was founded in 1932. Arab nomad tribes occupied the region before the formation of modern Saudi Arabia. During the era of the nomadic tribes, there were limited urban trading settlements where commercial activities took place. Up to the late 1930s, Saudi Arabia relied on money from Muslim pilgrims and agricultural activities for its economy.\n\nThe economic prospects of the kingdom changed dramatically following the discovery of huge oil deposits in 1938. Because of the wealth created by the oil sales, the kingdom was able to develop into a regional leader with modern amenities available to all Saudis. However, in spite of the wealth and modernity of Saudi Arabia, the country is highly conservative. Many Saudis hold on to some of the cultural values and traditions of the past.\n\nThe Mi’kmaq are among the native inhabitants of Canada. Archaeological discoveries indicate that these people have lived in Canada’s Maritimes provinces for over three thousand years (Hornborg, 2013). The first documented meeting between the Mi’kmaq and the European settlers occurred in the sixteenth century.\n\nThe Mi’kmaq called themselves ulnoo but the French and English started to use the term “Ni’kmaq”, which was a greeting work that came to be associated with the tribe during the early 17th century (Hornborg, 2013). The Mi’kmaq subsisted on hunting and fishing and it was news about rich fishing waters on their territory that attracted the Europeans to the region. During the seventeenth century, deep trade relations developed between the Mi’kmaq and the Europeans. The Europeans provided food, weapons and hardware in exchange for furs.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, settlers and immigrants had invaded the coastal provinces. This had a damaging effect on the Mi’kmaq traditional life. These people lost their land and were forced to settle on reserves. Majority of modern Mi’kmaq are settled on reserves along the coast of Eastern Canada. The Mi’kmaq have managed to retain their Native status while at the same time being a part of the Canadian society. This has enabled them to retain some of the cultural values in the Modern Canada.\n\nMi’kmaq and Saudi Culture\n\nLanguage\n\nA common language is one of the distinguishing features of people who have a similar culture. In Saudi Arabia, the common language is Arabic since this is an Arab country. The inhabitants of the kingdom communicate in various variants of the language including Nejdi Arabic, Hejazi Arabic, and Gulf Arabic. Saudi Arabia is home to millions of foreign workers who reside in the country. These foreigners communicate in their native languages making Saudi Arabia a country with a wide array of languages spoken.\n\nThe Mi’kmaq people communicate in the Mi’kmaq language, which is a part of the Easter Algonquian language group. This language was widely spoken by the Natives up to the nineteenth century. However, assimilation efforts by the French and British settlers led to French and English becoming more predominant over the twentieth century. Fulford and Daigle (2007) admit that by the large, the language has been lost. Most of the modern Mi’kmaq lack proficiency in their native language. However, there have been efforts by the Mi’kmaq to revitalize the language by teaching it to the young Natives over the last decade.\n\nReligion\n\nReligion plays a huge role in the lives of the Saudi Arabs and the Canadian Mi’kmaq. Islam is the state religion in Saudi Arabia and almost 100% of the citizens practice this religion. Islam plays a unique role in Saudi Arabia since this country has great significance to the global Muslim community. The country is not only the birthplace of the founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammad, but it also contains important mosques and holy sites. Saudi Arabia is considered since Prophet Muhammad was born and grew up in this region. The important religious sites in the country include the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi mosque, The Masjid al-Haram mosque, Mecca, and Medina. Muslims make annual pilgrims to the various holy sites and all prayers are made facing the Masjid al-Haram mosque, which houses the Kaaba,\n\nIn the pre-European contact era, the Mi’kmaq practiced different forms of traditional religion. However, upon contact with the European, many Mi’kmaq were converted to Christianity. At the present, Christianity (specifically Catholicism) is the majority faith of the Mi’kmaq. Hornborg (2013) reveals that the Mi’kmaq Christianity is founded on the teaching of the Catholic priests.\n\nIn spite of the predominance of Christianity, Mi’kmaq spirituality still plays a part in the lives of the modern Mi’kmaq. Mi’kmaq spirituality emphasizes the strong relationship between humans and the environment. The spiritual beliefs ascertain that the spirit of the creator exists in humans, plants, and animals alike. The Mi’kmaq engage in religious ceremonies where the guidance from the Creator is solicited. Prayers are an important part of Mi’kmaq spirituality and they are offered regularly.\n\nThe art of Mi’kmaq and Saudi Arabia\n\nThe Mi’kmaq are very skilled artisans. They are most famous for their porcupine quilling. This ancient art form makes use of stiff porcupine quills to produce crafts such as moccasins, baskets, and ceremonial shirts (Hornborg, 2013). The quillwork produced by the First Tribe is very expensive due to the grueling nature of the task. Porcupine quills are also used to make jewelry such as the Mohawk and earrings. In addition to this, the Mi’kmaq are skilled in beadwork.\n\nIn this art form, beads are woven onto leather or birch bark to produce exquisite pieces. The Mi’kmaq have a rich oral narrative tradition and the art of story telling is appreciated by this First Nation (Hornborg, 2013). Traditionally, stories were used to pass down the history of the community and great storytellers were revered. The Mi’kmaq have a number of myths and legends that continue to be told today.\n\nSaudi culture is rich in the literary art form of poetry. Janin and Besheer (2003) explain that the rich contribution in poetry is because poetry has for centuries been the highest form of art in the Arabian Peninsula. Poem composition and recital is an integral part of Saudi culture and traditional oral poetry remains popular today. An important aspect of Saudi art is that it does not include representations of living creatures by painting or sculpture.\n\nThis is due to the religious restrictions on such art forms. For this reason, traditional Saudi art entails making everyday functional objects more beautiful. One way of accomplishing this is through weaving and embroidery. Weaving can be traced back to the nomadic days when women wove carpets from goat or camel hair to make tents, carpets, blankets, and other useful items. To decorate these functional objects, geometric and floral designs are used. Some embroidery works include exquisite, flowing calligraphy of verses from the Koran (Janin & Besheer, 2003).\n\nMusic and Dance\n\nBoth Saudis and the Mi’kmaq make use of music and dance to express various emotions ranging from happiness to sadness. Music and dance is an integral part of the lives of the Mi’kmaq First Nation. These people use traditional songs and dances are used to celebrate life and important events such as marriage, death, and feasts. The Koju’a is the central traditional dance of the Mi’kmaq and it involves dancers moving energetically in a circle (Keillor & Archambault, 2013). The dancers move in a clockwise direction as they dance vigorously to traditional music. Male and female dancers participate in this dance and they are often clad in traditional attire as they engage in the dance.\n\nSaudi Arabia has a wide range of traditional music that is unique. Maisel and Shoup (2009) explain that the uniqueness and richness of Saudi music comes from its being derived from many sources. Early interactions between inhabitants of the region and other cultures including Indians, Africans, and Egyptians led to the development of the unique Saudi music. Saudi traditional music is also poetic in nature. The desert and the sea, which are the major geographical feature of the region, serve as the inspiration for most traditional songs. Most of the Saudi dances are male-oriented due to the conservative nature of the society.\n\nThere are some similarities between the dance and music of the Mi’kmaq and the Saudis. To begin with, the traditional songs in both cultures employ antiphonal structure. This is the musical structure where a leader sings first while others respond. Among the Mi’kmaq, a rattle or a hand drum serves as the major accompaniment to the music (Keillor & Archambault, 2013). Saudis make use of percussion instruments to accompany the singing and dancing and the audience may engage in rhythmic clapping. Another similarity between Saudi and Mi’kmaq music is that both have experienced western influence.\n\nMi’kmaq musicians make use of European instruments including the piano and the Cello in their performances. The First Nation has also produced a number of famous rock bands such as Forever and Medicine Drum (Keillor & Archambault, 2013). Such bands have experienced success in the contemporary music scene. Contemporary music is not only common but also very popular in Saudi Arabia. Owing to western influence, a number of famous Saudi pop stars such as Mohammad ‘Abduh have emerged (Maisel and Shoup, 2009). Such singers are not only popular in the Arab region but also in Europe and North America.\n\nTreatment of Guests\n\nThere is a similarity in the manner in which the Mi’kmaq and the Saudis treat family, strangers and friends. In both cultures, relationships are highly valued and respect and goodwill is shown to all. The Mi’kmaq are a friendly people and they are hospitable to friends and strangers alike. According to Hornborg (2013), it is considered an honor to extend hospitality to strangers and friends. Guests are always welcome to the home of a Mi’kmaq. Generosity is demonstrated by sharing food and drink with the guest. Even when the individual has little to spare, he is obliged to share it with the guests.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, guests are valued and treated with esteem. Greetings are an integral part of interactions with guests. They are considered a sign of goodwill and respect. When friends or strangers meet, they either shake hands or hug depending on their gender. Visitors are welcome by the host and a drink is typically offered as a sing of friendliness (Janin & Besheer, 2003). Meals play a major role in interactions and they are included in most meetings. The meal is often spread out on the floor and the guests sit on carpets or rugs on the floor to enjoy the meal.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper set out to describe the culture of the Mi’kmaq and the Saudi Arabs in order to show the differences and similarities between the two. It began by providing a brief historical background of the two cultures. It then highlighted the differences in some cultural attributes including language, religion, and art. The paper proceeded to show that in spite of the differences, the two cultures have some similarities in their songs, dances, and attitude towards guests. Through this paper, a better appreciation of the cultures of the Saudi Arabs and the Mi’kmaq has been developed.\n\nReferences\n\nFulford, G.T., & Daigle, J.M. (2007).

      "Horse Stall Design Improvement Essay\n\nSummary\n\nThe existence of organic and inorganic particles in stables poses a health risk to horses because they cause recurrent airway obstruction. Microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, contaminate air by releasing endotoxin and β-glycan into the air. Poorly ventilated stables have a higher concentration of dust than well-ventilated stables. In this view, the proposed solution to improve ventilation in stables is the incorporation of the dust sensor, Sharp Dust Sensor, into the air conditioner. The sensor automatically regulates the ventilation rate of the air conditioner, according to the concentration of dust in the stable.\n\nThe benefits of the ventilation system are that the sensor is sensitive, consumes less energy, and automatically regulates the air conditioner. The literature review shows that mechanical ventilation, natural ventilation, and modification of ventilation louvers are some of the methods, which are applicable in enhancing ventilation of stables. However, these methods have limitations because they require manual operation and rely on environmental conditions. Hence, the incorporation of sensor technology in the ventilation system of stable is necessary to automate the ventilation process. However, concerns arise because the existence of dust in stables is dependent on relative humidity and temperature. In this view, the design of the stable and ventilation system requires incorporation humidity and temperature sensors.\n\nProblem\n\nIn poorly ventilated stables, horses are prone to respiratory diseases because organic and inorganic particles accumulate in the air and cause pollution. These particles comprise irritants, allergens, and toxins, which harm the respiratory system when they enter into the lungs. Inorganic particles are mainly dust particles that emanate from the dusty environment. Comparatively, organic particles are the major pollutants of air in the stable equine environment because they comprise fungi, bacteria, fur, manure, and hay. Bacteria and fungi release inorganic particles such as spores and debris materials, which contain toxins. According to Walinder et al. (2011), bacteria and fungi contain toxic chemicals, such as 1-3-β-glycan and endotoxins, which inflame the respiratory system and cause respiratory disorders.\n\nHorses kept in poorly ventilated stables are at risk of developing respiratory disorders caused by the accumulation of organic and inorganic particles in the air. Essentially, microbial contamination is common in poorly ventilated stables because pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses accumulate in the air. Recurrent airway obstruction is a prevalent respiratory disease that affects horses in polluted stables (Witkowska, Kwiatkowska-Stenzel, Jozwiak, Chorazy, & Wokcik, 2012). In this view, ventilation is essential in designing stables because it influences the predisposition of horses to organic and inorganic forms of contamination. Therefore, this essay describes a new stable design with an improved ventilation system to protect horses from the effects of organic and inorganic particles.\n\nThe Proposed Solution\n\nThe proposed solution to the problem of air pollution by organic and inorganic particles in stables is the installation of a ventilation system, which is sensitive to dust particles in the air. The proposal is in line with the equine code of practice, which states that stables require an efficient ventilation system to prevent the accumulation of dust, noxious gases, and moisture (The National Farm Animal Care Council, 2013). The sensitivity of a dust sensor determines the ability of ventilators to change the rate of airflow in and out of the stables. In designing stable to detect dust and leverage the ventilation rate of ventilators, incorporation of Sharp Dust Sensor is necessary. In this case, the incorporation of the dust sensor in designing stable is central in achieving optimum ventilation.\n\nDescription of Sensor Technology Incorporated\n\nThe design of stable entails the incorporation of a dust sensor, which is a technology from Sharp World, an electronics company. According to Sharp World (2012), Sharp Dust Sensor is a device, which has the ability to detect concentrations of dust in buildings. Given that detection of dust occurs in stables, Sharp Dust Sensor is an appropriate sensor because designers have designed it to be an indoor sensor. The sensor has the ability to detect dust and smoke particles; hence, it is very sensitive to changes in the levels of dust in a given environment. According to Sharp World (2012), the dust sensor is very sensitive and has the ability to regulate the rate of ventilation in air conditioners and air purifiers automatically.\n\nThe sensitivity feature is important in stables because the concentration of dust particles varies according to temperature, humidity, and other activities within a stable. The feature of automatic regulation is central in real-time regulation of ventilation rate in stables. Sharp Dust Sensor uses light-emitting diode in detecting the concentration of dust in the air and gives an appropriate signal to air conditioners or air purifiers. The voltage output from the sensor is proportional to the concentration of dust in a given environment. Hence, the change in voltage output has a commensurate effect on the rate of ventilation. In this case, when the concentration of dust increases, the rate of ventilation also increases, and vice versa.\n\nVoltage Output versus Dust Concentration\n\nFigure 1: Sensitivity of Sharp Dust Sensor. (Sharp World, 2012).\n\nFigure 1 above shows the sensitivity of Sharp Dust Sensor to increasing concentrations of dust. From the figure, it is evident that the sensor can detect concentrations of dust from 0.0 mgcm -3 to 0.6 mgcm -3 . Comparatively, the voltage changes from 1.0 V at 0.0 mgcm -3 of dust to 3.7 V at 0.6 mgcm -3 of dust. Hence, the figure shows that the sensor is sensitive to dust concentration that is less than 0.6 mgcm -3 . The recommended dust concentration in a stable is less than 1.0 mgcm -3 and endotoxin concentration should be less than 11 ngcm -3 (Robison & Sprayberry, 2009). Therefore, Sharp Dust Sensor is appropriate in detecting concentrations of dust and regulating the rate of ventilation.\n\nDescription of the Design\n\nFigure 2: Proposed Design.\n\nThe design of the stable comprises a dust sensor, an air conditioner, and ventilation louvers, as main ventilation components. The dust sensor is very important ventilation component in the stable because it senses the level of dust within the stable and gives an appropriate signal to the air conditioner. The dust sensor from Sharp World detects dust by creating voltage output, which is a signal that goes to air conditioner. When the dust concentration is high, the dust sensor gives an enhanced voltage output, while when the dust concentration is low, the dust sensor gives small voltage output. Given that dust float in the air, positioning the dust sensor just above the height of horses in stable is appropriate. Horses mostly spend a great deal of their time standing, and thus, they inhale air from a height of 1-1.5 meters. Hence, detection of dust in the air at the height of two meters offers an accurate concentration of dust in the stable.\n\nAn air conditioner is another important ventilation component of the designed stabled. The air conditioner is subject to the signals from the dust sensor. As dust sensor generates voltage signals, it sends them to the air conditioner; hence, regulating the rate of ventilation. In this case, an important feature of the air conditioner is automatic regulation based on the concentration of dust in the stable. Roof of the stable is an appropriate position of the air conditioner. When dust levels are high, the air conditioner reduces the concentration by pumping air out of the stable through a vent in the roof. Fundamentally, the air conditioner removes polluted air and allows the ambient air to enter into the stable.\n\nVentilation louvers situated at the lowest positions on the walls are integral components of the ventilation system because they allow the ambient air to enter into the designed stable and replaces polluted air. The rate at which the air flows through the stable from the ventilation louvers to air conditioner is dependent on the concentration of dust particles in the air. When the concentration of dust is high, the dust sensor generates high voltage, which signals the air conditioner to hasten the ventilation rate of clearing air from the stable. In contrast, when the concentration of dust is low, the dust sensor generates a small voltage, which signals air conditioner to reduce the rate of removing air from the stable.\n\nBenefits of the Ventilation System\n\n  * The sensor requires less than 100 watts; hence, it is cheaper to maintain.\n  * The air conditioner does not require manual adjustment because it is automatic.\n  * Sharp Dust Sensor can effectively regulate the air conditioner because it is sensitive to dust.\n  * The ventilation system does not cause turbulence in the stables\n  * The ventilation system does not alter the condition of the ambient air in terms of temperature and humidity.\n\nBackground Information\n\nSince the problem of ventilation has been an issue in an equine stable environment for centuries, farmers have been relying on natural mechanism of ventilation, such as wind, breeze, and convection currents. However, the natural ventilation mechanisms have limitations because they are dependent on the direction of the wind, ambient breeze, topography, and weather. According to Witkowska et al. (2012), stables with mechanical ventilation are more conducive for microbial growth than stables with natural ventilation. This finding implies that natural ventilation has significant impact on stables because it determines the growth of microbes, and consequently, microbial contamination. However, natural ventilation has a limitation because it relies on the environmental conditions, which are highly variable and restrictive. Hence, there is a need of advanced ventilation mechanisms, which are independent of environmental factors.\n\nAs the size of a stable influences state of ventilation, modification of sizes has been an effective intervention. Essentially, construction of large stables enhances the flow of air, and thus, allowing ambient weather conditions to permeate stables. Moreover, large stables reduce congestion of horses and allow ambient air to flow freely within them. To optimize prevailing ventilation conditions, construction of ventilation louvers permits adjustment of ventilation manually, according to the perceived conditions of stables. Microbial growth occurs in summer because of high humidity and favorable temperature (Witkowska et al., 2012). In this view, stables require enhanced ventilation during summer and minimized ventilation during winter. For example, during summer, ventilation louvers open to allow maximum ventilation, while during winter, ventilation louvers partly open to conserve heat and allow ventilation. However, high humidity is essential in settling dust, which accumulates in the air during summer.\n\nThe use of ventilators in stables is a primary solution to the pollution of air by organic and organic particles. Since these particles accumulate in the air, horses inhale them in large proportions, which have detrimental effects on their lungs and entire respiratory system. Currently, there are diverse designs of stables and ventilators, which aim to solve the issue of poor ventilation and accumulation of organic and inorganic particles.\n\nRecurrent airway obstruction is a major respiratory disease, which affect horses in poorly ventilated stables. Construction of stables with mechanical ventilators is an effective solution, which farmers have applied in diverse forms of stables. In a study to determine the effect of mechanical ventilators on the quality of air in stables, Walinder et al. (2011) found out that the concentrations of ammonia, carbon dioxide, allergens, and ultrafine particles reduced significantly. In this view, the finding supports the use of mechanical ventilators in reducing the levels of organic and inorganic particles in the air, and consequently, decreasing predisposition of horses to recurrent airway obstruction.\n\nOther Concerns\n\nGiven that dust, humidity, and temperature have some relationships, the design of stable requires integration of ventilators with humidity and temperature sensors. Humidity is an environmental factor, which influences the concentration of dust in a stable. High humidity during summer encourages the growth of microbes, and thus, promoting microbial contamination (Witkowska et al., 2012). However, average humidity is very important because it alleviates pollution of air by settling dust particles. In this view, humidity requires stringent regulation to enhance settling of dust and prevent the growth of microbes. Temperature also has significant influence on the formation of dust in stables. During summer, hay and litter generate more dust than in winter because they are very dry. Moreover, during summer fungi and bacteria produce spores, which contain β-glycan and endotoxin (Walinder et al., 2011). These spores coupled with other organic and inorganic particles contribute to the occurrence of recurrent airway obstruction. Therefore, the effects humidity and temperature require consideration in the design of the stable and the ventilation system.\n\nReferences\n\nThe National Farm Animal Care Council. (2013).

      "National Basketball Association: Porter’s Forces Analysis Case Study\n\nUsing Porter’s competitive forces model, analyze the NBA’s market situation. How does the use of Akamai help the NBA (National Basketball Association) compete in this market?\n\nAccording to Michael Porter, there are five forces that influence the strategy that a business chooses to implement. These five forces are bargaining power of customers, bargaining power of the business’ suppliers, threat of substitute services and products, threat of new entrants, and rivalry among the existing competitors (“The Five Competitive Forces” 80). Rivalry among existing competitors has influenced the NBA’s strategy. Apart from NBA.Com there are other sites that provide online streaming of basketball games, break down league statistics, and provide team news. Sites such as ESPN provide news whereas Live-TV-Today has live streams for most league games.\n\nThis is NBA.Com’s current competition. NBA has partnered up with Akamai, a global online content distribution platform. One way the use of Akamai has given NBA an edge is through the use of its 25,000 servers located across the globe. These servers and data centres ensure that the site is never overloaded when accessed by many users at the same time. During big games, such as the playoffs, the site traffic is usually very high. Users receive content from the server either closest to them or has a good connection. That teams have dedicated sites on the OS Stream ensures that any news about the team is more reliable than news from other sites. The site is also well organised with an easy to use interface (Akamai).\n\nUsing Porter’s generic strategies model, what do you think is the NBA’s overall strategy or strategies?\n\nPorter’s generic strategies model is a way to analyse an organisation’s position in the industry and evaluate its competitive advantage. Companies will employ a differentiation strategy, cost leadership strategy, or a segmentation strategy ( Competitive Strategy 25). The NBA has implemented a product differentiation strategy. A product differentiation strategy involves providing a product different from the competition. Organisation will have skills, resources, and capabilities that the competition lacks.\n\nThe NBA has leveraged on Akamai’s capabilities in delivering dynamic and personalised content. The reliable and quality online stream of videos and other media from NBA.Com gives it an edge over other sites. The global presence of 25,000 Akamai servers ensures the site does not get overloaded like most sites that are prone to congestion. Akamai is also able to determine what kind of Internet connection users are using. They can therefore customise content for individual users based on this information (Akamai).\n\nWhy is it important that all fans in the world have the same experience?\n\nIt is important that fans all over the world have the same experience because the NBA is a global brand with global appeal. The games may be played in cities in the United States and Canada, but the fans are located all over the world. The 2013-2014 season will have 92 foreign players from 39 countries playing in the league (Helin). The fans in their home countries will want to have the same experience as the fans watching in stadiums. Delays, especially in relaying live games, and the fans may opt for other sites providing live streams or TV broadcasters.\n\nWhy is it important that individual franchise owners can build, manage, and distribute on the NBA platform their own content?\n\nIt is important that individual franchise owners can manage and distribute their own content. The franchise owners get to pick content that reflects their team’s culture. They can communicate to their legions of fans across the globe a true reflection of the team. Fans will have the same info on their teams regardless of their location. Franchises are also able to put in place a positive media strategy. In some cases, such as the unveiling of a new player, the franchise may want to be the first to report to the public. With the numerous sources of news on the Internet, fans want a reliable source of information.\n\nThe word partnership appears several times in the video. Who are the NBA’s partners? How does the concept of a strategic ecosystem apply to the NBA’s partnership strategies?\n\nNBA’s partners are those businesses or organisations affiliated with the league. They include TV partners, apparel manufactures, sports drinks makers, car makers, and electronics companies. Notable partners include Taco Bell, Gatorade, Kia Motors, and AT&T Wireless (Clark). These partners are aiming at leveraging on NBA’s global appeal to boost their sales. Their adverts are visible on the site, on courtside, and other places NBA events are held. With visitors to the site from 220 countries this is a vast audience for the adverts.\n\nA strategic ecosystem is where various organisations work together to produce a product or service. They combine their varying expertise into a value web. The companies are therefore able to concentrate on their core competencies. They extend to their partners in the value web what they cannot accomplish on their own (Rosemann 17). For example the partnership between Lenovo, NBA, and Akamai creates a strategic ecosystem.\n\nNBA organises the games and provides other content on their site. Akamai ensures that the games and information can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Lenovo gets to advertise on NBA.Com through a marketing partnership (Akamai). This subsequently helps Lenovo increase sales and profits. NBA and Lenovo can therefore reach a wider audience while maintaining their employment and infrastructure costs. Through these partnerships NBA is also able to grow its revenue through advertising.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAkamai. “Customer Testimonials – NBA”. Online video clip. Akamai . Akamai, n.d.

      "AAA Company: Business Entities and Profit Organizations Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nBusiness entities are profit making organizations, which require concise decision making and mutual coexistence among employees and stakeholders to achieve goals and objectives. Business operations should be geared towards achievement of profit targets and commanding wider market segment. However, relationship with competitors should be healthy to avoid misunderstanding, which leads to disputes. Nonetheless, successful entities allow employees to contribute to decision making and planning of future activities. It is the prerogative of the management and stakeholders to ensure there is a clear channel of communication and distribution of resources among all departments to avoid blame shifting thus to enhance quick supervision. AAA as an international company needs to adhere to forces of mindset in order to build confidence within employees’ fraternity thus to make work efficient and effective.\n\nForces that influence mindset\n\nPast experience of workers is instrumental in the quality of work and profits gained by the business. Experience is a tenet that distinguishes between junior and senior employees hence this can be realized in line with the quality of services in the company. Vernon and Bud have worked with AAA Company for more than twenty years therefore, they command a lot of experience and relationship with potential customers. It is fundamental for the company to integrate suggestions by the leaders and critically evaluate the merits and demerits of their thoughts. More so, it is not a guarantee that suggestions from seniors are correct and beneficial but they need to be analyzed to avoid demoralizing other employees. In this regard, AAA invested in mentoring the individuals therefore, it is worthless losing them to other rival firms that may utilize their experience to out-compete the company in the market (Wind, Crook, & Gunther, 2005).\n\nHereditary is a trait of mindset that bestows individual courage that they belong to an entity. Employees belong to an organization therefore, they are not allowed to disclose secretes and operations of the enterprise to other firms. New owners are allowed to make changes to activities of the firm but should consult employees because it may interfere with flow of work ultimately removing existing departments for instance, transportation of non-perishable goods will stretch the operations of the business and mar relationship with employees and competitors.\n\nGenetics differentiate characteristics of individuals though at times, genes create a link among members of a society. AAA indulges in transportation of perishable goods therefore; it is complex to change to non-perishable goods transportation because it is of different genre and can ruin the relationship with its customers and other firms in the same industry. Genetic difference is witnessed when Vernon and Bud gave reasons as to why they opposed change of activities hence their disagreement gave diverse reasons for negating the idea.\n\nBusiness environment is paramount for successful fat-tracking of business activities. Creation of stable working conditions and tranquil mindsets enable personnel produce quality products. Vernon and Bud were disappointed by change of business activities, which ultimately can affect the style of allocating resources. Good environment can be observed through engaging in dialogue and mutual organization of activities (Rowe, 2004).\n\nEducation of employees is instrumental in creating perspectives regarding to decision making and allocation of resources. Skilled personnel have the ability to handle tasks with ease thus accelerating decision making process. Highly qualified individuals are productive and accrue huge salaries and experience therefore, all companies tussle to retain all their experienced employees (Wind, Crook, & Gunther, 2005).\n\nBehavioural and relationship mindsets among employees influence human resource decision making. Decisions should accommodate views and opinions of all employees irrespective of social, economic, and political affiliation. Good relations are aimed at reducing acrimony in work place that may cause inefficiency in production of goods and services. On the other hand, employees who produce exemplary work are rewarded. Behavioural and relationship mindsets help human resource treat all workers equally while at the same time correcting ill-mannered workers.\n\nReferences\n\nRowe, J. (2004).

      "Comparing Utilitarianism with Immanuel Kant’s View Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Kant’s view of Utilitarianism\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe utilitarianism theory and Emmanuel Kant’s views on morality from the basics of philosophy are the most widely studied concepts in attaining an excellent understanding of philosophy. The theory of utilitarianism on normative ethics requires individuals to uphold actions that maximize utility while reducing harm. Utilitarianism is the most plausible ethical theory based on the belief that the greatest percentage of people benefit from morally upright actions (Rachels 43). Consequences from immoral and unethical actions clearly explain the morally right actions that individuals should adopt for their benefit as well as the benefit of others.\n\nOn the other hand, Emmanuel Kant’s views on morality are clear in his moral law and his propositions on ethics. In his book, ‘The groundwork for the metaphysics of morals,’ Kant expands his philosophical research to cover morality (Allison 111). Unlike utilitarianism concepts, Kant claims that morality goes beyond outward vices and virtues. Therefore, the theory of utilitarianism is not correct in holding that individuals only maximize utility and minimize harms. Although the two approaches on ethics differ, they have a similar objective, which explains ethics. This paper compares Emmanuel Kant’s views with utilitarianism as the most potent approaches to ethics.\n\nKant’s view of Utilitarianism\n\nUtilitarianism, as explained by Stuart, differs from Kant’s view on the issue of consequences. According to Stuart, consequences for various actions have a significant impact. Utilitarianism focuses on explaining that every choice undertaken has a consequence. Ethical decisions yield positive results, thus maximizing benefits while reducing harms. The utilitarianism approach explains that the decisions made by individuals rely on the consequences yielded to determine their ethical nature. The motives and reasons for carrying out any action play an insignificant role in determining if a decision is ethical or not. This claim is in opposition to Kant’s view that consequences do not entirely matter.\n\nKant explains that only the reason and motive behind every action can determine whether a decision made is ethical. He states that individuals should undertake actions based on their motives regardless of the consequences such actions bring. Kant states that the actions should be free from any human desires and emotions because the motives for all actions are vital regardless of the consequences (Kant 67).\n\nTeleological and deontological ethics in philosophy clearly illustrate this difference between utilitarianism and Kantian ethics. Deontological ethics emphasizes the motives and intentions of conducting an action despite the outcome of such actions. This theory is in line with Kant’s views on morality, where human reasoning plays a crucial role in performing different actions. On the other hand, the teleological ethical perspective states that the results for all actions matter in determining the nature of the undertaken decisions. The theory does not consider those individuals who honestly undertake good actions but fail in the results because of unavoidable factors. Therefore, this theory explains utilitarianism as developed by Stuart by showing how it differs in consequences with Kantian ethics.\n\nUtilitarianism theory also emphasizes the relationship between morality and human pleasures and desires. It explains that individuals can undertake actions that make them happy, regardless of whether they will cause harm to others. Utilitarianism sees the efficient attainment of one’s desires as the only role of human reason because of the belief that intentions for various actions by individuals do not matter. However, with Kantian ethics, the motives for various actions are of great significance. This claim is clear from how reason forms the basis for morality according to Kantian ethics. According to Kant, trusting human desires and emotions may lead to dire consequences as opposed to the unchanging reason. He states that reason is solid and independent of factors that may prevail to change it. Thus, individuals should undertake correct actions based on their pure reason.\n\nUtilitarianism explains morality as an empirical issue based on experiences while Kantian ethics explain it as a rational matter. While explaining his views, Kant is a rationalist who believes that individuals must have prior knowledge other than only through experiences. He states that morality is a rational concept and that knowledge can be derived from various sources. Kant also explains that morality has definite rules that demand consideration. Absolute rules exist that govern morality by requiring the consideration of all motives because the intentions for various actions are vital irrespective of whether they yield pleasure or not.\n\nOn the other hand, utilitarianism emphasizes morality as an empirical matter that depends on prior experiences. Also, the theory explains that morality lacks absolute rules and acts. The utilitarianism explained by Stuart focuses mainly on acts that yield maximum benefits. It suggests that individuals can do any acts based on experiences if the acts yield excellent results. Thus, utilitarianism is incorrect in requiring that we only maximize utility and reduce harm because some actions are impermissible even though they yield good consequences. Unlike Kantian ethics, utilitarianism raises moral issues because of the failure to consider the various intentions and actions despite their good results.\n\nKant emphasizes the importance of pure intentions and goodwill in his ethical philosophy. The morality of which is understood to all rational beings from the categorical imperative. The categorical imperative has three formulations that mainly emphasize people acting in ways they would be pleased if they became universal laws (Kant 32). Kant explains the significance of respecting others’ duties as well as the universality of morality. Thus, he explains his moral theory based on universalizing the truism according to his categorical imperative that forms his principles. This plan explains why individuals have intrinsic worth according to Kantian ethics.\n\nHowever, critics claim that the motives behind various actions require little desire to enable individuals to partake them. However, pro-utilitarianism claims that the intentions of various decisions and actions should be inclined towards obtaining pleasure and desires because many people view utilitarianism as a generally accepted principle of utility that derives its principles from sensible experience and maximization of benefits. Utilitarianism further depicts how individuals are not intrinsically valued. The opponents of utilitarianism say that simple rules such as telling the truth can change easily to suit the goal for achieving maximum pleasure (Rachels and Rachels 29). Also, it is too time-consuming and attracts injustices because unjust acts can be justified by the principle of deriving maximum benefits.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the differences between utilitarianism with Emmanuel Kant’s views, they all aim at explaining the morality theory. These philosophical theories form a firm foundation for understanding morality. In my opinion, utilitarianism is incorrect in terms of requiring that individuals should only maximize benefits and minimize harms. It raises moral questions for lack of consideration of the motives behind actions. However, Kantian ethical perspectives require people to act out of goodwill and think of themselves as free to reason rightfully. Kant believes that there are no evil actions because all actions are undertaken for the right reason (Kant 36). The comparison of the theories, as depicted in their differences, portrays the different perspectives of the two philosophers. The significance or criticism of both theories makes them the most widely studied philosophies on morality.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAllison, Henry.

      "Technology Use in Classrooms: Pros and Cons Essay\n\nEntering the era of information technology means incorporating modern media as tools for data acquisition and analysis in every single domain, including education. However, the promotion of modern media as essential tools for teaching and learning may have its disadvantages.\n\nA detailed study of the key effects of modern media in education, therefore, is required. As long as the use of modern media by students is controlled by teachers and occurs as a part of the lesson and not the focus thereof, the specified tools can be viewed as a means of enhancing the learning process and improving the performance of students.\n\nAmong the key benefits of the use of modern media in classrooms, the fact that technology serves as essential aid in the course of acquiring new skills and learning new information deserves to be mentioned. In order to acquire new information and process it quickly, learners need supporting material, which in most cases must include both visual and audio elements.\n\nWhile watching a video can be viewed as an alternative to incorporating modern media into the curriculum, one still has to admit that traditional media lacks an essential element, which is the opportunity for learners to interact with the source of information.\n\nModern media, in its turn, has solved this problem, providing students a chance to use an interactive interface in order to learn new information quickly. Indeed, a closer look at the modern media will reveal that most software used for learning purposes presupposes that students should be able to interact with the program (Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2011).\n\nAnother important benefit that modern media provides is the fact that the learners are capable of accessing the necessary information easily. It should be kept in mind, though, that the benefit in question needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It is rather doubtful that students, especially young learners, are capable of identifying which information is useful for them, which can be skipped, an which data is downright harmful.\n\nTherefore, unlimited access to information, which the introduction of modern technologies into the classroom environment allows for, should be controlled by the teacher. The control executed by the latter will help students filter the information that they will come across, showing them how to locate the data that can be used for further studies.\n\nIt should be kept in mind, though, that the use of technologies in classroom may also pose a range of threats to a successful learning process once misused. To be more exact, technology, especially modern one, may easily become a distraction for students and keep them away from the actual focus of the lesson.\n\nThe specified problem becomes especially obvious once social media is introduced into the curriculum and the discussion of the key topics and themes is transferred from the classroom environment into forums. Unless the teacher plays an active part in the discussion process and steers the conversation the designated way, students may easily go off the track and engage in the communication that does not serve any studies related purpose.\n\nApart from the specified problem, technology may also contribute to the enhancement of cheating rates among the students. First and most obvious, having access to the Internet and not being controlled by the teacher in their surfing process, students may easily start searching for cheats to their tests and the answers to the questions that they are supposed to answer in the course of the lesson on their own. As a result, learners acquire very little information and are incapacitated of training their skills.\n\nThe specified problem, in fact, is much more serious than it might seem at the first glance. While cheating during a test might seem as an innocent attempt at escaping a poor grade, it sets the student’s mind frame at using easy solutions to addressing the problems that require their mental resources.\n\nIn other words, the online cheating tools, which learners become open to once technology is introduced into the curriculum, destroys the notion of learning as the teacher represents it to the students. Therefore, technology may disrupt the process of learning to the point where students may fail to acquire the skills that will enhance their further self-directed learning (Ni, 2013).\n\nIt should be noted, though, that the two problems described above can be addressed with the help of the teacher’s supervision and a provision of detailed instructions, as well as enhancement of ethical principles in the educational environment under analysis.\n\nOnce the students are introduced to the concept of responsibility (Manian, 2013), they will be able to realise that cheating on attest will only harm their further development as learners. Similarly, the principles of responsibility will help learners refrain from abusing the freedom that the teacher provides them with once they communicate online during the lesson.\n\nThe incorporation of technology into the school curriculum opens a range of opportunities for learners, yet it also poses quite tangible threats to the success of their learning. It is imperative that the teacher should adopt the right teaching approach to motivate learners and foster the idea of self-directed learning in each and every student.\n\nReference List\n\nDabbagh, N. & Kitsantas, A.

References\n\nTechnical analysis\n\nTechnical analysis refers to a methodology used to analyze securities especially when there is need to estimate the movement of market prices (Tharp, 2008). In order to carry out a conclusive technical analysis, reference must be given to the volume of sales, the basic price that dominates a given market and patterns of the past market data. There are a number of analytical tools used in a quantitative analysis and behavioral economics. However, slight differences and theoretical conflicts have been noted between the modern portfolio theory and active management theory (Tharp, 2008).\n\nTrading rules and models can also be used as part and parcel of mechanisms during the process of technical analysis. Nonetheless, volume transformations and trading principles are attached to the price of stocks. It is pertinent to mention that the identification of chart patterns, various cycles experienced in the stock market, business cycles, links between different price ceilings adopted by a market and regressions are vital parameters that ought to be put into consideration. In addition, moving averages as well as the relative strength index are crucial mechanisms that can be used to demonstrate financial technical analysis.\n\nThe point and figure chart methodology is employed in technical analysis. Since time and price cannot be plotted against each other, it makes the charting process unique. For instance, a stock being traded is exchanged at $30, with a reverse box of 3 units and a one dollar measurement. If the value of the stock is increased to $ 25, the closing level of the stock is anticipated to drop down to $26 and later to $ 21 as shown below:\n\n$30 X\n\n$ 26 X\n\n$ 23 X\n\n$20 X\n\nThe Dubai Financial Market Company in the UAE makes it possible for stock traders to draw price overlays. The latter is achieved by choosing the technical indicators option. Bollinger Bands, Exponential Moving Averages and Simple Moving Averages are some of the technical indicators utilized in most UAE stock markets.\n\nMargin trading\n\nWhen stocks are bought using inadequate money, the purchasing style is referred to as margin trading. Stocks can be bought using an institutionalized method even in cases where capital resources are inadequate (Fox, 2009). Most exchanges often allow margin trading.\n\nIn terms of mechanism, it is vital to mention that margin trading may be quite logical in some cases even if investors invest in future outcomes. Margin funding can also be another option unless the future list contains the required stock.\n\nMargin trading can be more viable in cases where the client is patient enough bearing in mind that future stock can hardly be availed from 4 to 8 weeks (Fox, 2009). The future market may also witness low interest rates occasioned by brokers.\n\nMargin calls are made by brokers if the buying price is lower than the value of shares. The latter is applicable in margin trading and future market.\n\nIf 3000 shares are bought from company X which exchanges at $200 per share, a buyer requires $600,000. However, if company’s future contract is purchased by a buyer, only fifteen percent should be paid out. Margin trading can also be used to execute the same operation.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) stock brokers enjoyed impressive profits through margin trading in 2012. After projecting the impending good performance of UAE stock market, the brokers made attempt to avail margin trading services to their customers. The local stocks in the UAE have witnessed renewed interest since 2012 when margin trading proved to be profitable. The rush for brokerage services also explains why several brokerage firms seek accreditation in the UAE. Once the brokerage firms have been accredited, the trust level from customers has also improved significantly.\n\nShort selling\n\nSecurities can either be borrowed or possessed by a seller. When such securities are sold out, the process is referred to as short selling. The main motivating factor behind short selling is the anticipated fall in the price of securities. During a decline in the price of stocks, traders can purchase and later sell the same stocks at a higher market price. The intention is to make as much profit as possible (Sloan, 2009).\n\nOne of the common mechanisms of short selling is speculation of the market. In some instances, individuals who trade in stocks may decide to minimize the risk of the market for stocks before gaining significant rise in price. It is theoretically infinite for short sales to undergo the risk of loss (Sloan, 2009). Hence, experienced traders who are well versed with both the short and the long term risks can reap the optimum benefit from short selling.\n\nA numerical example can be demonstrated as follows. A buyer may speculate that a given stock which is trading at $80 will soon experience a drop in price. As a result, the trader borrows 200 shares that he/she later sells to prospective buyers. This causes a deficit of 200 shares that belong to the lender. It was only through borrowing of the shares that the seller managed to make the transaction. In any case, the borrowed shares may be returned back to the owner in future. The stock then declines to $60. The trader purchases 200 shares at a low price and makes a profit, even after refunding the lender the borrowed shares, plus the commission.\n\nIn 2012, short selling and lending regulations for securities were approved by UAE authorities. After a meeting among the Board of Directors, money-maker and short selling of securities alongside other regulations were put in place in order to streamline the operations of the stock market.\n\nReferences\n\nFox, J.

      "Social Issues: Urban Livability and Sustainability Essay\n\nConstant movements of people from rural homes to urban centers have been due to several reasons, such as the search for employment and better social services. With the unceasing movema ents of humans to cities, the unrelenting demand for services has pushed up the prices of social amenities and other basic services. For example, purchasing rental houses in large urban areas like Portland, Boulder, and San Francisco is more expensive than in places like Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.\n\nIronically, costly areas like Portland and Santa Barbara have active plans for managing growth, thus maintaining their high status. On the other hand, expansive and less dense regions experience low entry of new occupants. When people can avoid focusing on somea specific cities by ensuring that they live in them, the cost of living in such areas will go down out-rightly. The present generation should be able to meet their needs without compromising on the abilities of the future generation from meeting their own necessities.\n\nIn achieving this choice in the United States, for instance, the Federal and State governments should allocate resources according to the development index of the cities in the continent. Cities with low development index should get more funding. The move will ensure that a city like Los Angeles develops its infrastructure and services just like Portland city in Oregon.\n\nWith lucrative services and available job opportunities, Los Angeles will be able to tap some populace from the highly expensive cities. In addition, as a way of creating employment for the citizens, the US government should offer subsidies and tax holidays to investors who intend to set up companies in the diverse cities. Such policies will attract many investors to these locations, and in the process pull out large population from the densely populated areas.\n\nIn addition to terms of tax holidays for companies, the government can levy low tax rates for a specified period on employees who accept to work in such areas. Notably, the incentives will encourage both investors and citizens to move to these inexpensive locations. One of the reasons for the expensive services in San Francisco is due to the availability of well-paying jobs and numerous opportunities for self-development. Such moves by the government can result in equal development of regions, hence attracting high population.\n\nWhen people move out of cities like Portland and San Barbara, most of the resources will lack demand, and with the law of demand and supply in economics, the move will push down the cost of houses and other necessities (Chivot and Weterings par. 7).\n\nPromoting sustainability and livability require pooling of knowledge and resources in developing expansive regions (Johnston par. 4). In the US, the Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) has planned to build affordable houses in densely populated cities. Moreover, subsidies on government services and social amenities in expensive regions can make life cheaper for families living in such cities.\n\nOpportunities for commercial investment, transportation, and housing are significant requirements for a livable and sustainable city. Therefore, such government approaches will ensure that such services are available in all cities. Since sustainability and livability go hand in hand, launching renewable energy initiatives in expansive places like Phoenix and Los Angeles help in creating cheaper and safer energy supplies (Maddox par. 6).\n\nThe cities of the future can only be livable and sustainable if NGOs and government agencies pursue or address the two aspects of all initiatives. Such moves are long-lasting and not compromising on the future as well as providing equity, safety, opportunities, and mobility. If government agencies and NGOs can approach the issue of sustainability and livability in urban centers as demonstrated above, the overall quality of life will improve in all regions, thus making all humans happy irrespective of their location.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nChivot, Elin, and Rob Weterings.

      "Stories of Rwanda’s Recovery From Genocide Essay\n\nThe thousands of the ethnic Tutsis were killed during the hundred spring days in Rwanda in 1994. The open violence against the Tutsis demonstrated by the Rwandan Hutus resulted in mass killings which can be defined as the genocide against the Tutsis. However, in spite of the genocide’s tragic consequences and terrific destructions within this Central African country, the Rwandans showed the significant courage and patience to re-build the society where the Hutus and Tutsis continue to live side by side.\n\nThus, many countries facing the problems associated with the relations between different ethnicities can rely on the Rwandans’ experience to recover from the terrific results of the genocide because the Rwandan society changed significantly based on the positive transformations; because the government’s effective approaches to re-building the society allowed to stabilize the situation in the country; and because the genocide was ceased with references to the actions of the internal actors rather than international actors’ activities.\n\nToday, the killers and the victims of the genocide live side by side, and the government focuses on finding the effective measures and legacies to overcome the consequences of the genocide and to state the principles of justice in the country. Although the echo of the genocide is still observed, the Rwandans did a lot to contribute to the positive social transformations and to recover from the tragedy.\n\nFrom this point, the Rwandans are inclined to use the principle of operating what they have to recover instead of hoping for better opportunities. The Rwandans achieved significant successes in recovering from the genocide not only with the help of transforming the society but also because of changing their visions of the genocide (Wilkens presentation, October 31, 2013). As a result, the other countries can operate the experience and lessons of the Rwandans in order to recover from the similar tragedies.\n\nThe main change which occurred in the Rwandan society after the genocide and which contributed to the process of recovery is the observed stabilization in relation to the social and economic life.\n\nDuring the genocide, “leaders used family ties to target male relatives for recruitment into the killing groups, which were responsible for carrying out the genocide”, and during the years after the tragedy, the leaders or authorities intended to promote the peace in the country with the help of reforms to stabilize the economic and social lives (Fujii 2008: 568).\n\nWith references to the case of Rwanda, it is necessary to discuss the concept of stabilization in its close connection with the idea of decreasing the ethnic divisions in order to prevent the further demonstrations of violence based on the ethnic prejudice (Fujii 2008: 596; I’m Not Leaving 2013).\n\nIt is important to note that the international actors played a minimal role in affecting Rwanda’s recovery from the genocide because the genocide was ceased predominately with references to the internal forces. The international community showed little interest in the problems experienced by the Rwandans. Thus, the attempts of the United Nations to regulate the process can be accessed as minimal and not enough to influence the development of the crisis (Wilkens presentation, October 31, 2013).\n\nAlthough the Rwandan genocide destroyed the lives of thousands of people, the country has recovered from that horrific event relying on the internal forces and authorities’ policies rather than on the activities of the international actors.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFujii, Lee Ann. “The Power of Local Ties: Popular Participation in the Rwandan Genocide”.

Surface Elements Incorporated In Mike Rosman’s Tale To Make It Relevant\n 4. The Relevance Of The Rosman’s Tale To The Popular Culture\n 5. How Do The Two Tales Differ?\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe traditional fairy tales have undergone a huge transition in the popular culture to adopt a more liberal approach. This has been attributed to the concepts of poaching and relevance. The popular culture has modified the traditional fairy tales to fit into their own personalized comprehension with a view of making them more relevant. Poaching and relevance are two concepts that are closely intertwined in the popular culture (Sensoy and Marshall 194).\n\nThis is attributed to the fact that they both play a vital role in fostering a cultural creation that is known as the ‘popular’. Poaching entails the act of taking a traditional folk tale in an attempt to create some relevance by altering the original work. The concepts of poaching and relevance are applied by different writers who possess diverse authorial agenda with the main aim of transforming the fairy story.\n\nThe fairy tale needs to have a social relevance to the target audience. The writers apply the motifs and elements of traditional folk tales to come up with stories that either relate directly or indirectly with their own occurrences and ideologies. This has expanded to internalize the desires of the new audience.\n\nThis paper will focus on the folk tale Cinderella as depicted in Mark Rosman’s ‘A Cinderella Story’ (2004) to illustrate the concepts of poaching and relevance in the popular culture and how the two tales differ from each other.\n\nCinderella As Depicted In Mark Rosman’s ‘A Cinderella Story’\n\nCinderella is a traditional folk tale that has been used to elaborate and bring to fore the element of unjust oppression that is overcome with a triumphant reward. The traditional folk tale tells the story of a beautiful title character named Cinderella who lives a happy life as a child before the death of her father (Dundes 14).\n\nThe circumstances surrounding her life under the custody of her mean stepmother and stepsisters are unfortunate as she is subjected to forcefully serve them. However, her life takes a drastic turn when the prince holds a ball in a view to acquire a bride. Cinderella attends the ball with the help of the godmother and she dances with prince the whole night to the envy of every girl who attended the ball.\n\nShe loses her glass slipper in a bid to beat the deadline set by the godmother. The prince finds the slipper and uses it to trace Cinderella to the shock of her stepmother and stepsisters. Just like any fairy tale, the prince marries Cinderella and both the stepmother and stepsisters are welcomed to live in the castle hence everybody living happily ever after.\n\nIn the 2004 film, ‘A Cinderella Story’ by Mark Rosman, the story takes a similar approach as the traditional folk tale with the exception of some added elements in the modified story (Haase 207). In this film, Rosman, changes the setting from an old cottage to a diner. He also changes the name of the character from Cinderella to a more popular name, Sam. Sam’s father dies leaving Sam in the custody of her mean stepmother and daughters.\n\nThe stepmother forces Sam to work as a servant in the diner. The prince role is played by a character named ‘Austin’, who is a popular lad in the school. Sam confides to Austin while chatting on the internet about her willingness to attend Princeton University but without the knowledge of who she was talking to. Austin invites Sam to the school dance but on the night of the dance, Fiona forces Sam to work in the diner.\n\nHowever, Sam’s friends who work in the diner convince her to go to the dance and find her a dress. They promise to cover up for her and she promises to be back by midnight before her stepmother gets back to the diner. Sam has a good time at the dance but before she could reveal who she was to Austin, the alarm on her phone goes off and she hurriedly get back to the diner. She runs out fast and in the process drops her phone.\n\nAustin traces her with the phone, a process which is hard at first as every other girl claims ownership to the phone. In the meanwhile, Sam finds a box that had been hidden by her father. The box contains documents that name her as the sole owner of the diner.\n\nThe film ends with Sam and Austin leaving for Princeton University as a couple and Sam’s stepmother and stepsisters being forced to work in the diner in a bid to recoup all the money that they had stolen from Sam’s father.\n\nSurface Elements Incorporated In Mike Rosman’s Tale To Make It Relevant\n\nAs the concept of poaching requires, the modified story need to incorporate some elements that distinguishes it from the traditional folk tale so as to make it more relevant. The first element that is considered is the setting of the story. It is noted that the settings of both stories take different perspectives. The traditional folk story adopts a traditional setting while Rodman adopts a modern setting to create some relevance.\n\nHe adopts the use of a diner and a school as opposed to the traditional setting. The additional element helps the target audience in the popular culture to relate to the story.\n\nThis creates some sort of familiarity as the settings can be related with day to day social experiences of any target audience watching the story. It would be irrelevant if Rosman had adopted the traditional setting element as the popular culture is not familiarized with such settings such as a castle and kingdoms.\n\nThe other element revolves around the characters. In the traditional oral tale, there is only one protagonist, Cinderella who everybody hopes that she will emerge successful and happy (Helt 20). The villains are the stepmother and her two daughters. Rosman’s story has added an element in the characters by using more than one protagonist and few villains hence adding a twist to the story.\n\nThe protagonists in Rosman’s story are Sam, the main hero, her best friends in the diner and Austin himself. The villains in this story include the stepmother, her stepsisters and Austin’s ex-girlfriend who gives Sam a hard time in school. Just like in any fairy tale, all the protagonists succeed in defeating the antagonists hence living happily ever after.\n\nA notable element that Rosman integrates to create relevance is the fact that the villains in his story are subjected to a hardship life that had prior been subjected to the protagonists. Sam’s stepmother and stepsisters resume duties in the diner and one of Sam’s best friends, who worked as a servant before, resumes the role of the supervisor.\n\nThis is relevant to the popular culture where most people believe in revenge for wrongs done. The elements applied in the traditional fairy tales emphasize on the need of all characters, both the protagonists and the antagonists to live a ‘happy ever after’ kind of life.\n\nRosman has also added some elements in the plot of the story to create some relevance. In his exposition, he starts the story with Sam and his father who runs a very popular diner in their town. He marries the wicked and self-absorbed stepmother and the scene is given some relevance when he dies whilst saving the self-absorbed stepmother from death. In the exposition, the writer is keen to note that no will is left.\n\nThis is relevant to the audience as the rest of the story would have been irrelevant if a will had been left at the time of his death. Rosman also creates a common conflict for the hero at home, work and in school. This element is relevant as it encompasses the daily modern experience of the target audience relating to the story.\n\nAs it is with any fairy story, the conflict is the epitome of the tale as it is what that makes the tale more interesting with the audience keen to see how the conflict will be resolved. The writer expounds the conflict to apply to different perspectives of life as opposed to the traditional folk tale which only concentrate with the conflict at home. This brings us to the additional elements adopted in the plot’s climax and resolution of the conflict.\n\nRosman takes a different approach. It is evident that most characters used in the story have unresolved conflicts unlike the traditional oral folk tale. The conflict range from the conflict at home, workplace and school. The writer in his climax resolves all the conflict and brings in an entirely new perspective in his story.\n\nThe villains adopt the struggling lives that they had subjected the protagonists. Austin, who also had a conflict with his father regarding his choice of career abandons what the father was subjecting him to, football, and is seen leaving with Sam to pursue his dream of going to Princeton University.\n\nThe Relevance Of The Rosman’s Tale To The Popular Culture\n\nThough the oral tradition fork tales are considered as myths, they play a key role to develop the textual structures of our lives. The non-oral tales, such as Rosman’s story is derived from this oral traditional folk tales. The only distinctive feature is its inclusion of additional elements that is premised upon the culture and genetics of the popular culture (Booker 290).\n\nJust like any other transitioned fairy tale, Rosman’s tale has been consumed with the main aim of diverting the audience from the reality world to that of fantasy. This is because the tale in most cases retains its root from the oral traditional folk tale. The audience crave for a more important and instinctual knowledge that the fairy tale delivers to them.\n\nBy picking what he liked about the Cinderella oral tradition tale, Rosman spins the story to create a new masterpiece that fits into his culture or beliefs. By studying his audience and change in culture beliefs and ideologies, Rosman modifies the story by eliminating the irrelevant original parts of the story and subsequently incorporating his own that he deems relevant to his audience.\n\nFor example, the popular culture does not relate to being governed by kings and queens hence using a prince to be Cinderella’s savior would have been irrelevant to his target audience. He therefore adopts a different setting that revolves around the modern world, and to which the audience relate with. He nevertheless retains the basic themes of the story which are relevant to the audience.\n\nThe theme of kindness and compassion is inherent throughout the masterpiece. This gives a relevant teaching to the audience that no matter the circumstances, kindness and compassion will always triumph over the evil.\n\nThe audience also find Rosman’s story to be more credible in comparison with the oral traditional fairy tale which is clearly metaphorical. This is relevant as the transitioned story validates and justifies the cultural beliefs and aspects that the audience relate to. The transitioned story has also been used in the popular culture for purposes of maintaining conformity. This is relevant as it takes up the function of an icebreaker in expressing social acceptance.\n\nIt is also relevant as it provides compensation for the sense of realism lacking in the oral fairy tale. The author brings the fairy tale to reality and replaces the imaginary characters in the audience minds with a real picture. Rosman’s story is also relevant as it serves both the educative and entertaining purposes.\n\nThe audiences who are undergoing difficult times are able to relate with the story with the hopes of triumphing over the difficult times whilst at the same time enjoying the humor side of it.\n\nHow Do The Two Tales Differ?\n\nThough the two stories share the same theme and structure, they are distinct in one way or another. First, Ramson’s story discards some elements of the original tale as illustrated in the discussion above. However, it is noted that the author introduces some significant elements in the story to make it more relevant. Further, the oral story mirrors an everyday occurrence with no specific reference to any culture.\n\nThe poached story on the other hand has been modified to adapt and fit into the modern lifestyle. The word content also differs as the contemporary version incorporates new content to fit with the culture audience to which it is targeted. The two tales also relay different messages to the target audience.\n\nWhile the oral folk tales only relay the message regarding determination and success, the contemporary one relay additional messages through its modified elements. The first message is the need to leave a will. The story emphasizes on the lack of Sam’s father to leave a will that entitled Sam to take over the diner.\n\nSecondly, the story focuses on the importance of education whereby both Sam and Austin are determined to attend the best university to further their education. Lastly, it embodies the theme of determination and success as a bid to retain some elements inherent in the older version.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Cinderella story has been retold many times with each story creating some relevance while at the same time retaining a similar story line. From the above discussion, it is therefore evident that poached stories like Ramson’s ‘Another Cinderella story, possess a strong connection with the oral traditional Cinderella fairy tale.\n\nThough both tales differ in one way or another, they are strongly intertwined so as to encompass the original theme from the original tale. It is also evident that both tales tend to share the same target audience, the children, though they both contain different content in both their themes and structure.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBooker, Keith.

Similarly, the firm’s total liabilities and the shareholders’ equity have increased significantly.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, it is evident that HP has experienced significant improvement in its capacity to cover its short-term debts when they fall due.\n\n                               Balance sheet [amount in a million $]\n                               2008                                   2009     2010     2011     2012   \nTotal current assets           51,728                                 52,539   54,184   51,021   50,637 \nTotal non-current assets       61,603                                 62,260   70,319   78,496   58,131 \nTotal assets                   113,331                                114,799  124,503  129,517  108,768\nTotal current liabilities      52,939                                 43,003   49,403   50,442   46,666 \nTotal non-current liabilities  21,450                                 31,279   34,651   40,450   39,666 \nTotal liabilities              74,389                                 74,282   84,054   90,892   86,332 \nTotal stockholders’ equity     38,942                                 40,517   40,449   38,625   22,436 \nTotal liabilities and equity   113,331                                114,799  124,503  129,517  108,768\n\n\nChart 2\n\nSource: Morningstar: Hewlett Packard Company\n\nTrend analysis\n\nAccording to Milano and Robnett (145), trend analysis entails evaluating changes in a firm’s financial balances over a particular period for example 5 years. The greatest advantage associated with trend analysis relates to its simplicity.\n\nMilano and Robnett (145) further assert that trend analysis is undertaken by evaluating certain components of the income statement or the balance sheet over a certain period.\n\nHP has managed to increase its total assets over the past five years. However, in 2012, total assets declined to $108,768 million as illustrated by figure 1. Similarly, total liabilities and equity have undergone the same trend as illustrated by figure 2.\n\nFigure 1\n\nSource: Morningstar: Hewlett Packard Company\n\nFigure 2\n\nSource: Morningstar: Hewlett Packard Company\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011. Hp’s sales revenue increased from $ 114,552 million to $127,245 million.

However, the firm incurred a substantial decline in its gross profit margin and net income in 2012 as illustrated by figure 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nFigure 5\n\nSource: Morningstar: Hewlett Packard Company\n\nFinancial ratios: Liquidity ratios\n\nCurrent ratio\n\nThe ratio is used in determining the effectiveness with which an organization can meet its short-term financial responsibilities. The ratio is calculated using the formula; [current assets ÷ current liabilities] (Mark 266).\n\n               Amount in a million $\n               HP                     Dell            \nCurrent ratio  $50,637/$46,666        $27, 968/$23,439\n               =1.1:1                 =1.2:1          \n\n\nAccording to financial analysts, the current ratio of 2:1 shows that a firm is in a good financial position to cover its short-term obligations when they fall due. On the other hand, the current ratio higher than 2:1, for example, 3:1 shows that s firm is holding extra cash in its current assets.\n\nHP’s current ratio (1.1:1) is relatively lower compared to that of Dell (1.2:1). The ratio indicates that HP can cover its current liabilities 1.1 times while Dell can cover its current liabilities 1.2 times (“Morningstar: Dell Incorporation” 1).\n\nQuick ratio\n\nThe ratio is calculated using the formula; [Current assets-inventory] ÷current liabilities.\n\n             Amount in a million $                                 \nQuick ratio  HP                           Dell                     \n             [$ 50,637-$ 6,317]÷$ 46,666  [$27, 968-$1,382]÷$23,439\n             $44320÷$46,666               $26586÷$23,439           \n             =0.9:1                       =1.1:1                   \n\n\nAcid test ratio is used to determine the degree to which organizations can cater to its current debts when they fall due without selling their inventories. Norton and Diamond (733) assert that the ideal acid test ratio should be 1:1.\n\nA high quick ratio indicates that an organization may have a problem catering for its current liabilities. An organization with a high quick ratio is required to hold a relatively large amount of money in cash to cater to its current liabilities (Gitman & McDaniel 34).\n\nFrom the analysis, it is evident that HP is effective in managing its quick ratio compared to Dell. The firm’s quick ratio is 0.9:1 which is considered to be the ideal ratio.\n\nSolvency ratios\n\nThese ratios are calculated to determine the effectiveness of an organization to meet its long-term debts and their associated interests. By calculating the solvency ratios, firms’ management teams can determine the likelihood of their organizations surviving in the long term.\n\nCurrent debts to inventory\n\nThe ratio is used to illustrate the degree to which an organization relies on inventory in repaying its debts. The ratio is calculated using the formula; current liabilities ÷ inventories.\n\nHP                     Dell      \nAmount in a million $\n46,666/6317            23439/1382\n=7.4:1                 3.7:1     \n\n\nHP has a relatively high current debt to inventory ratio (7.4:1) compared to that of Dell (3.7:1. This suggests that HP relies more on inventory in financing its operations compared to Dell.\n\nCurrent debts to net worth\n\nThis ratio is calculated using the formula; [current liabilities÷ net worth]. The ratio is used in determining the amount of money that is due to creditors.\n\nNet worth= Total assets-total liabilities\nHP’S Net worth                             Dell’s net worth\nAmount in a million $                    \n$108,768-$86,332                           $47,450-$36,860 \n$22,436                                    $10,590         \n\n\nThe current debt to net worth ratio is illustrated below.\n\nHP                     Dell         \nAmount in a million $\n$46,666/$22436         $23439/$10590\n=2.1:1                 =2.1:1       \n\n\nTotal liabilities to net worth\n\nthe ratio is calculated by dividing the total liabilities with the net worth. According to Khan and Jain (76), the ratio indicates the relationship between the owners’ equity and the total debts in an organization.\n\nHP                     Dell           \nAmount in a million $\n$86332/$22436          $36,860/$10,590\n=3.8:1                 =3.5:1         \n\n\nHP has relatively higher total liabilities to net worth ratio compared to Dell Incorporation. This shows that the firm is more effective in repaying its creditors compared to Dell.\n\nProfitability ratios\n\nGross profit margin\n\nThe margin is calculated by dividing gross profit with the sales revenue for a particular financial year.\n\nThe margin is used to illustrate an organizations’ ability to cover its operating expense and at the same time earn a profit (Khan & Jain 78). Below is a comparison between HP and Dell’s gross profit margin.\n\nGross profit margin\n\nAmount in a million $\nHP                     Dell           \n$27,972/$120,357       $12,186/$56,940\n=23.24%                =21.40%        \n\n\nHP is more effective in covering its operating expense compared to Dell Incorporation as illustrated by the difference in gross profit margins.\n\nNet profit margin\n\nThis ratio illustrates the after-tax profit for every dollar of sales generated by an organization. Net profit margin is used to illustrate an organization’s operational management efficiency. The ratio is obtained by dividing the net income with sales.\n\nNet profit margin\n\nAmount in a million $\nHP                     Dell         \n($12,650)/$120,357     $2372/$56,940\n= (10.50%)             =4.12%       \n\n\nThe above calculation shows that HP experienced a net loss margin of 10.5% while Dell made a net profit of 4.12% during its last financial year.\n\nReturn on assets\n\nThis ratio is obtained by dividing the net income with the total assets. It illustrates the effectiveness of an organization in utilizing its assets to generate profits.\n\nHP                     Dell         \nAmount in a million $\n($12650)/108768        $2372/$47,540\n=-11.63%               =5%          \n\n\nReturn on equity\n\nThe ratio evaluates the extent to which an organization utilizes the invested capital to generate profit. It is calculated by dividing the total net income with the shareholders’ equity.\n\nHP                     Dell        \nAmount in a million $\n($12650)/ $22436       $2372/$10680\n=-56.40%               =22%        \n\n\nPro forma analysis for HP\n\nHP has undergone significant growth over the past decades. However, the firm has experienced numerous challenges over the past few years. One of the factors that have increased the challenges that HP is currently facing relates to intense competition.\n\nAccording to Hardy (1), the personal computer industry has become very competitive. This has arisen from an increment in the number of industry players. As a result, the market is currently characterized by numerous computer products such as smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe industry’s competitiveness is also enhanced by increased investment in cloud computing. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman recently affirmed that the increase in competition is pressing the firm’s profit margin.\n\nDuring its first quarter in 2013, the firm reported a decline in its sales revenue and profit margins in all its major outlets.\n\nConsequently, the firm has projected a decline in its financial performance. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Meg Whitman asserted that the outcome of all the efforts that the firm is undertaking to cope with the intense competition would be experienced in 2014 (Hardy 6).\n\nSome of the efforts that the firm is currently undertaking to include developing new types of business and consumer products such as low-energy servers. The firm is also investing in cloud computing and developing new types of laptops.\n\nThe firm has projected a decline in its profitability with a relatively small margin compared to 2012. Its net profit margin will decline to -10.86% from -10.5% while the gross profit margin will decline to 22.94% from 23.24%.\n\nDespite the changes in the business environment, HP will experience a slight improvement in its financial strength. For example, the firm’s quick ratio is projected to increase to 0.97: 1 from 0.9:1. On the other hand, the firms’ current ratio is projected to increase to 1.12:1 compared to 1.1:1.\n\nThis shows that the firm’s capacity to cover its short term obligations will improve significantly.\n\nHP will experience a slight improvement in its return on asset ratio from -11.63% to -11.05%. On the other hand, the firm’s return on equity ratio will increase from -56.4% to -41.53%.\n\nThis shows that the firm will experience an improvement in its management effectiveness (“HP: Investor relations” par. 1).\n\nConclusion and recommendations\n\nThe above analysis shows that HP has a relatively stronger financial performance compared to Dell Incorporation. Despite the intense competition in the personal computer industry, HP has managed to sustain a positive financial performance over the past five years.\n\nThis is well illustrated by the various financial ratios such as the liquidity ratios, profitability ratios, and the management effectiveness ratios. The pro forma analysis shows that HP will experience a relatively poor financial performance in 2013.\n\nTo improve its future financial performance, HP’s management team should consider the following:\n\n 1. The firm should invest in continuous product research and development. This will ensure that its products are aligned with the market changes. As a result, the firm will gain sufficient competitiveness.\n 2. The firm should consider investing in new product development. One of the technologies that the firm should embrace include cloud computing.\n 3. HP’s management team should consider integrating various growth strategies such as strategic alliances.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCourtney, Mary and D. Briggs.

      "Pak-Suzuki Company’s New Technologies Research Paper\n\nAbstract\n\nCompanies like Pak-Suzuki are always on the lookout for new technologies, which can fit into their organizations to leverage their competence in the competitive business market. On noticing the increasing demand for innovation, Pak-Suzuki integrated information systems and established innovation systems to remain competent in the market. The demands for the new technologies have caused changes in the business objectives of Pak-Suzuki.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs technology is influential, companies have always tried to align their business objectives with the emerging changes in technologies to spur corporate growth. Gefen argues that new technologies change the way businesses operate, especially the business objectives (730).\n\nCompanies are targeting to achieve short-term and long-term goals and objectives to achieve competitive advantages over rival firms. A typical example of a company is Pak-Suzuki. The company has established the importance of reviewing its business objectives and aligning them with new and emerging technologies to enable effectiveness of decision making (Hoque 234).\n\nWhen new technologies emerge in an organization, changes to the business objectives are essential to ensure organizational dominance in the competitive markets (Tanriverdi 60). For instance, Pak-Suzuki is a company that operates within the highly competitive automotive industry and always revises its objectives to keep abreast with the growing technology.\n\nChanging these objectives enables the company to pursue its business goals, achieve higher profits, ensure constant growth, increase its returns on investment, expand the market share, augment the sales flow, improve the corporate image and reputation, and increase the shareholder values (Pirzada and Ahmed 49).\n\nLiterature Review\n\nAs means of transforming its operational techniques and corporate processes, modern companies have sought to integrate new technologies and revise their aims and objectives towards matching the emerging innovations (Wymbs 465). Research has associated modern technology with increased positive reputation and corporate trust (Gefen 927).\n\nMany companies such as Pak-Suzuki have always struggled to ensure that they remain competitive in the market by aligning their business goals and objectives with the dynamic changes of information technologies (Chan 9). The Pak-Suzuki has recently adopted new technologies into its business operations.\n\nA study done by Pirzada and Ahmed indicates that Pak Suzuki is a leading automobile industry in Pakistan, which has modern technology and offers quality products to consumers (95). While different companies have different objectives, it is crucial to note that a significant number of companies are realigning their objectives to meet the expectations of technology (Tanriverdi 63).\n\nCompanies such as Pak-Suzuki use information technology to leverage the achievement of the strategic objectives (Pirzada and Ahmed 95). Current business models such as the e-enterprise business model perceive technology as a driving force of the witnessed changes within the corporate world (Hoque 43).\n\nMotivation\n\nWhat motivated and inspired this study is the growing urge to discover the rationale behind the influence of technology on the business objectives.\n\nProblem statement\n\nMany business organizations struggle to maintain their competitive advantages against their rivals using new technologies (Chan 34). However, many companies fail to realize the benefits of using the technologies because they do not formulate and align their business objectives so that they can optimize new technologies to their competitive advantages (Tanriverdi 65).\n\nTo address the problem, this study explores the effects new technologies have on the business objectives of firms such as Pak-Suzuki to enable the companies understand how to modify their objectives to optimize the emerging technologies that have currently proven more efficient than before (Chan 12).\n\nObjectives of the research\n\n  * To determine Pak-Suzuki’s objectives, which need to be reviewed in accordance with new changes in technologies\n  * To evaluate how information technology enables managers to change Pak-Suzuki’s objectives\n  * To establish how the business objectives are aligned with a company’s new technology\n\nScope\n\nThe scope of the study remained limited to Pak-Suzuki Company’s business objectives, which have undergone appropriate revisions purposely to align with the new technology that has spurred operational changes in the company.\n\nResearch Methodology\n\nThis study holds that there is much empirical evidence of the existing literature regarding the influence of technology on the objectiveness and planning of companies. The study adopted the triangulation research methodology that has its basis on the literature review of different studies on the effects of technology on the company’s objectives, with Pak-Suzuki as the case study.\n\nThrough the qualitative research approach, the study engaged both the primary and secondary data materials. Printed and online journals were sources of secondary data, while the website of Pak-Suzuki offered the most needed primary data.\n\nThe business model involved\n\nFig: Diagram showing the major elements of the e-enterprise business model\n\nThe diagram above describes the business technology model on which the study hinges upon. According to Hoque, the e-enterprise business model describes the manner in which technology transforms the operations of companies in the modern business world (32).\n\nWith the e-enterprise business model, companies seek to make any appropriate changes to its operational techniques predominantly to match the demanding changes in innovation (Hoque 43).\n\nThe model holds that technology transforms corporate operations and forces companies to streamline their objectives and targets (Hoque 51). With technology, an influence on company operations is increasing and companies have found need to revise their targets and objectives.\n\nResults and Analysis\n\nFigure: The revised objectives to meet technological demands\n\nAnalysis for research objective one\n\nThe company has established that business objectives, namely, productivity, profitability, company growth, human resource training, improvement of the core values of the organization, marketing, competitive analysis, change management, quality products and services, optimal use of resources, and customer creation provide specific direction to the company’s goals, which change according to the company’s adoption of information systems.\n\nAnalysis of objective two\n\nInformation technology is one of the technologies that Pak-Suzuki has integrated into its business operations and has changed the company’s objectives by transforming the business rules, which include the payment system that the company uses in its financial transactions between the customers and suppliers (Pirzada and Ahmed 49).\n\nIn addition, other issues include the changes in the use of computer networks for real time communication and the use of the networks for training purposes.\n\nAnalysis of objective three\n\nPak-Suzuki has tried to align its business objectives to match the changes in technology to make the business operations compatible with the new changes.\n\nPak-Suzuki’s objectives, which the management has tailored to match with the new changes in information technology, include increasing profits, innovating current and existing products and services to meet the ever changing customer behavior, needs, and expectations, making optimal use of the firm’s resources, and increasing the firm’s productivity (Chan 23).\n\nDiscussion: the computerized workplace\n\nComputer networks in Pak-Suzuki provide a platform for social sites, which are useful in marketing, data mining, and observing the behavior of customers in real time to determine if the business objectives are current and consistent with the strategies of the firm. Some modern technologies that are operating through the computer networks have directly influenced the management of Pak-Suzuki to revise its objectives.\n\nThese modern technologies include the use of cashless payment cards such as MasterCard and Visa Card to facilitate the transfer of funds between the customers and suppliers or business organization. Additionally, the company uses information technology to develop its human resources system (Wymbs 89).\n\nExamination of the manner in which Pak-Suzuki has applied information technology on its business objectives shows that it has transformed its business objectives significantly. The linkage provides the company with the ability to identify the type of technologies that can be useful in aligning and supporting the business strategic objectives with the emerging technologies (Pirzada and Ahmed 49).\n\nMoreover, the company is able to determine the competitive strengths and technologies so that it can review the objectives, which map the company’s business goals with the new technologies. Research indicates that when a company sets its strategic objectives, it has to consider the suitability of the type of technology in use and any changes that may arise because of the new technologies.\n\nDue to the rising demand for technology and its perceived efficiency in company operations, a growing research has shown that Pak-Suzuki uses information systems to design and support its manufacturing activities.\n\nSuch forms of information technologies enable the firm to pursue and achieve the objectives of increasing productivity, enhancing performance of the performance of its employees, as well as transforming its manufacturing activities (Pirzada and Ahmed 49).\n\nTo achieve the objectives, Pak-Suzuki uses technology to facilitate effective decision making, perform appropriate planning, undertake creative designing of products, and carry out precision engineering.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the study, it is clear that technology has a profound effect on the business objectives of a company. As a case study, Pak-Suzuki has integrated information systems into its operations and continuously reviews its objectives in accordance with the rising demands for the information system. Such approaches have enabled the company to utilize resources and remain competitive.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nChan, Stephen. “Information technology in business processes.” Business Process Management Journal 6.3 (2000): 224-237.

      "Anthropogenic Climate Change Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate change is one of the current ubiquitous and controversial environmental issues. Some scholars allege that climate change is human caused, and mainly through greenhouse gases that are continuously emitted by companies.\n\nHowever, others argue that it is caused by natural forces such as; volcanoes and solar variations (Hayhoe par.9, 14). With these, this paper analyses some of the reasons given to show that; indeed, climate change is anthropogenic.\n\nAssertions of Climate Change being Anthropogenic and Evaluation\n\nThe first assertion is by the Institute of Physics, whereby in a research conducted, there was a general consensus; that indeed, the current global warming is human caused. There was a general conviction that human activities heightened the rate of greenhouse gases such as, methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide; hence, causing climate change (Institute of Physics par. 1-2).\n\nThis is a rather preconceived notion considering that other natural activities such as water vapour, volcanic episodes, and solar variation cause climate changes. In this case, the report is not convincing and only seems to focus on one side while completely ignoring the natural side.\n\nAdditionally, the second assertion is related to a report presented by the IPCC, which indicated that there was a rise in the level of carbon dioxide in the air within the past 8,000 years and Miller and Spoolman’s work. According to IPCC, carbon dioxide has gone up; thus, it is sound to allege that climate change is anthropogenic (Global Greenhouse Warming par.5-6).\n\nSimilarly, Miller and Spoolman (10-11) indicate that, in a report released by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 1,360 professionals agreed that human activities have degraded around 60% of the earth’s ecosystem. Climate change has been linked to pollutant activities such as coal burning, industrial wastage, use of pesticides, and other toxic chemicals.\n\nThis is a highly biased assumption as the authors have failed to analyse the natural factors that might contribute to climate change. Although human activities cause global warming, it should not be assumed that other natural occurrences have no effect on climate.\n\nThe third assertion is by Farley who alleged that most of the Americans continue to argue that the burning of fossil fuels has recently contributed to global warming; thus, it is possible that climate change is human oriented and not necessarily natural (Farley par. 1). Most of the authors who agree that climate change is anthropogenic link the changes to greenhouse gases.\n\nOthers attribute the increase of carbon dioxide since industrialization to the cutting down of trees and fossil fuel burning. According to Farley, when carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, the earth warms by around 1.2 to roughly 1.3 degrees Celsius (Farley par. 7). It is obvious that most authors do agree that to some extent, climate change is caused by human activities.\n\nHowever, to a large extent they have ignored the fact that it can also be caused by natural activities, such as, possible volcanoes and solar variability. In this case, it is imperative to have a closer look at contrarian to fully understand issues surrounding climate change.\n\nAssertions of Climate Change not accelerating due to Human Activities and Evaluation\n\nClaiming that climate change is purely anthropogenic is rather biased. It is obvious that though scholars believe that climate change can be caused by human activities, they also feel that this can also be directly caused by other aspects. For instance, although Farley believes that greenhouse gas has an effect on the climate, he also quotes other causes such as volcanoes and solar variability (Farley par. 8).\n\nIt is irrational to disapprove the view that man’s actions, for example, deforestation, have highly led to global warming. Nevertheless, alleging that climate change is caused only by human activities is an unfounded reasoning that should not be taken into account.\n\nIt is obvious from research that it is hard to pinpoint what exactly contributes to climate change. The first assertion is related to a research done by Alexander Cockburn, which indicated that in the era of the great depression, the burning of fuels reduced by roughly 30% (Farley par.9). Nevertheless, the concentration of carbon dioxide did not reduce.\n\nWith this, Cockburn opposes that the heightening of carbon dioxide in the air does not necessarily result from fossil fuels, but rather argues that water vapour is the major greenhouse gas causing climate change. Moreover, he argues that the increased concentration of carbon dioxide emanates from the ocean, and not necessarily from the burning of fuels.\n\nIn this case, the heightening of carbon dioxide can be said to be natural and not anthropogenic (Farley par.9). Although the research is to some extent factual, it is rather prejudiced considering that the view that the burning of fossils also leads to an increase in carbon dioxide cannot be entirely dismissed.\n\nThe second assertion is that, during the cretaceous period, the surface temperature was as high as 6-8 degrees Celsius, and had nothing to do with human activities. In addition, research has brought out the occurrence of 10 naturally oriented glaciation events over the past 1million years. In this case, orbital alterations have contributed largely to climatic changes that are linked to glaciation.\n\nSolar variability has also been found to affect climate. Solar radiation has been said to be directly related to the Northern Hemisphere’s surface temperature (Farley par.39).\n\nFarley’s research is direct to the point and credible. However, reading the article one would be inclined to think that climate change is largely caused by natural activities. This is rather fallacious, considering that human activities that have led to pollution have vastly caused climate shifts.\n\nThe third assertion is that the occurring climate change has at times been argued not be anthropogenic. In a study conducted by sociology experts from Iowa State University on 5000 agriculturalists, it was revealed that sixty six percent believed that indeed climatic change was occurring, but only forty one percent believed that such changes were caused by man’s activities.\n\nMost of the farmers believed El Nino and La Nina cycles to be largely responsible for the general climate changes (Curry par. 1-2). However, this is a biased and unpersuasive assertion.\n\nThis is because the same farmers who did not believe that climate changes are anthropogenic, are the same people who have been making concerted efforts to combat climate change by cutting back on fossil fuels, ensuring that there are cover crops, and reducing till farming (Curry par.7).\n\nIf they indeed believed that climate changes were not human oriented, they would not make efforts to come up with such strategies. Their beliefs and actions are highly contradictory thus it is rational to argue that both natural and human activities contribute to climate change.\n\nConclusion\n\nClimate changes and global warming, which to a large extent stem from anthropogenic causes, pose as a grave threat to human beings, plants, and animals. However, it should not be assumed that climate changes are only caused by human activities. Other natural causes, such as, solar variability and volcanoes are also major contributors environmental and climate shifts.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCurry, Judith.

      "Effects of Massage Therapy Report\n\nIntroduction\n\nMassage has been in practice for many centuries and refers to manipulation of external and deep-seated levels of muscle and adjoining tissue through different methods in order to improve their function, quicken a healing process, reduce reflex activity in tendons, prevent motor-neuron vehemence, and enhance relaxation and general well-being as well as a pastime.\n\nIn the survey carried out in 2007, at least 25% of all adults in America had a massage in 2006 (Web MD 2013). There are various massage therapy styles in use and it is up to an individual which style to choose depending on their need.\n\nMassage Styles\n\nSwedish Massage\n\nSwedish massage is the most common and popular massage style, which involves delicate long blending strokes, as well as agile cadenced tapping strokes on most outer layers of tendons. Swedish massage involves the movement of body joints too (Web MD 2013). Swedish massage has four types of stroke.\n\nThe first stroke, effleurage, is a frictionless sliding stroke suitable for calming soft tissues. The second stroke, petrissage, involves pressuring and kneading (Web MD 2013). It follows immediately after the first stroke. The third stroke, friction, involves down reaching circular motions that make the layers of tissue move against each other, and, as a result, increases blood flow in the body and subdivides scar tissue. The last stroke, tapotement, is a brief alternating tap carried out with clenched hands (Web MD 2013).\n\nNeuromuscular Therapy Massage\n\nThis type of therapy involves manipulation of delicate tissue (Web MD 2013). Neuromuscular therapy massage has a medical foundation and usually targets tender tendon points, circulation, nerve constriction, and postural problems arising from constantly recurring motion injuries. Neuromuscular therapy massage aims at treating biomechanical problems (Web MD 2013).\n\nDeep Tissue Massage\n\nDeep tissue massage is suitable for calming painful and tough areas in the body. Deep tissue massage employ less rhythmic motions but can be very suitable especially in cases involving continued pains like those arising from back strain.\n\nSignificance of Massage Therapy\n\nMassage therapy leads to several benefits; in particular, it works on back pain better than acupuncture. In addition, it relieves headaches and osteoarthritis by reducing stiffness and pain. Further, it reduces cancer symptoms and minimizes stress and anxiety (Web MD 2013).\n\nPrinciple of Spinal Pain Management\n\nA number of adults in America seek medical attention for back pain several times in a lifetime. Back pain is the most occurring medical issue affecting 80% of all adults in the US. Massage is usually the best option for back pain especially when conventional medication fails to relieve it. According to the study carried out in 2003, massage therapy treats recurring pain in the back (University of Rochester Medical Center 2013).\n\nAs a massage expert utilises his/her hands or special equipment in massaging muscles, blood circulation increases which in turn transports required oxygen and nutrients to muscles. This occurrence leads to elimination of waste like lactic acid, which causes pain in various muscles (Web MD 2013). Pain that has persisted for several weeks can disappear through application of acupressure massage.\n\nIn addition, acupressure massage leads to improved mobility when mixed with exercising and stretching. Lower back pain or lumbago is more common than upper back pain and can heal on its own. However, back pain can also be stressful both physiologically and psychologically (University of Rochester Medical Center 2013). Such pain results from issues to do with bones, muscles or nerves in the spinal cord.\n\nPoor posture or a damaged spinal disc usually leads to back pain. Massage therapy endeavours to minimise pain, relax tendons, and bring about a sense of wellness (Hospital for Special Surgery 2012). A tear comes up in the muscle fibres when muscles get strained or pulled.\n\nWhen muscles heal, scar tissue entrenches in hard lines opposed to an existing muscle and such a scar prevents a muscle from operating smoothly. Massage therapy is directed at reducing scars leading to proper healing of muscles (Hospital for Special Surgery 2012). As such, muscle efficiency goes up.\n\nSafety Concerns of Massage Therapy\n\nMassage therapy is not safe and can result in undesirable and unforeseen side effects though serious side effects are rare. According to the survey carried out in 2007, one out of ten massage therapy patients experiences minor discomforts a day after a massage session. Such discomfort is usually a form of soreness known as post-massage soreness (Ingraham 2012).\n\nIn addition, massage can lead to fresh injuries, increase existing issues, prevent patients from seeking better care and lead to mild stress in a patient. For instance, facial release therapy is usually very deep and focuses on healing adjoining tissues. Massage therapy can lead to poisoning because of waste products released during massage, which may settle in the body (Ingraham 2012).\n\nDevelopment and Application of Newly Designed Massage Instrument\n\nThis study explains how a newly manufactured massage apparatus, the Hand Grip T-bar is suitable for reducing consistent non-specific low back inflammation by way of cross-friction massage (Yoon et al. 2012). Twenty-two respondents with an average age of 51 years participated and the results showed that patients on Hand Grip T-bar manifested improvement while those on Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation showed no improvement (Yoon et al. 2012).\n\nEffect of Massage on Pain Management\n\nThis study aimed at establishing the effects of massage on pain management for thoracic surgery patients. A sample size of 160 patients participated in the study. The researcher reveals that massage therapy is a solution to various problematic challenges the individuals are facing.\n\nSuch challenges include inflammation and anxiety. As such, more research is required to confirm this hypothesis that postoperative massage therapy has clinically important role in assisting patients get better after surgery (Dion et al. 2011).\n\nMobilization versus Massage Therapy in the Treatment of Cervicogenic Headache\n\nThe study aimed at comparing effects of cervical accumulation with massage regimen in the treatment of cervicogenic headache. It involved thirty-six respondents divided into two groups where one group dealt with spinal movement methods while the other group received treatment through massage techniques on the neck area. This study found out that spinal movement for upper cervical vertebrae within their usual range manifested greater improvement in headache inflammation compared to manual massage on the neck in individuals with cervicogenic headache.\n\nConclusion\n\nMassage is a very old practice in the history of humankind. It serves several needs chief among them relaxation and medical therapy. The most popular type of massage, Swedish massage has four stages. In the medical field, massage is suitable for consistent lower back pains, cervicogenic headaches and healing in postoperative cases. Researchers need to study the concept of massage deeper especially in medicine.\n\nList of References\n\nDion, L, Rodgers, N, Cutshall, SM, Cordes, ME, & Cha, S 2011, ‘Massage for Pain after Thoracic Surgery’, International Journal of Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork, vol.

      "The Power of Togetherness: Adidas and Its Brand New Advertisement Report (Assessment)\n\nIntroduction\n\nPromoting sportswear might seem easy – as long as sport exists, there will always be high demand in the given niche. However, Adidas was one of the first companies that decided to appeal to the general audience, thus, opening more opportunities for the companies producing sports clothes.\n\nThe given step, however, also opened the door to numerous challenges, which Adidas fights very efficiently in such commercials as the advertisement of T Max 6 shoes.\n\nDescription\n\nIn their advertisement of T Max 6 shoes, Adidas provides an image of a hall with a range of lockers, two pairs of shoes, the red ones in the foreground and the white ones on the left and on the right side of the red pair. In the distance, a group of people can be seen. In the center of the advertisement, a caption saying “Together we can” runs in what is supposed to remind of a handwritten note.\n\nAnalysis\n\nSetting\n\nAs it has been stressed above, Adidas clearly puts the stake on both athletic performers and average citizens, which the advertisement displays in a very graphic manner. On the one hand, the setting, with lockers and a long hall, can clearly be defined as a gym at the very least.\n\nThus, sportsmen are being addressed. However, the silhouettes of the people in the background are so vague that they could be practically anyone, from Dennis Rodman and Michael Jordan to any member of the target audience. Therefore, the viewer can easily imagine himself among sport stars and, thus, relate to the advertisement and the product in question.\n\nMessages\n\nNo matter how vague the background might be, though, one can spot easily not one, not two, but at least three people walking in a straight line.\n\nA seemingly minor detail at first, on a second thought, the given element of the commercial appears to be the most important part of the advertisement, not only because it affects the audience on a subliminal level, but also because it appeals to people’s necessity to be a part of society, which the catchphrase in the caption reiterates and, thus, reinforces.\n\nFor a number of reasons, people walking in line are the kind of a cliché that always renders the heartstrings of the audience in the right way. Perhaps, it is the sense of being a part of a strong team of people who mean business and knowing that there are reliable people ready to support any of their members that affects the audience.\n\nAnyway, the blurred image of a team meaning serious business happens to be one of the strongest aspects of an advertisement, which touches upon people’s need for friends and support. In other words, the advertisement practically screams to the audience, “If you wear our shoes, you will have strong and supportive friends and be a member of a team”; and, quite honestly, very few people can resist such an offer.\n\nColor cast\n\nFinally, the choice of color and its arrangement in the advertisement must be mentioned. It was wise of Adidas to use only one aggressive color in the picture; with the rest of the colors toned down, blood red shoes in the foreground make a statement of their owner’s persistence an success. Another peculiar aspect of the color cast concerns the way in which the palette was arranged in the picture.\n\nWith one red shoe in the foreground and the second one in the background, the advertisement offers the audience curious visual rhymes. The impression of symmetry grows even stronger as the viewer notices two similar white shoes on the left and right from the red one.\n\nFinally, the clever use of light also serves its purpose, making the important elements visible and leaving the places that the audience’s imagination should work with in the shadow.\n\nEven though the idea of putting the product, i.e., the shoe, in the limelight might seem dated, in the given commercial, it appears to be quite natural, seeing how the commercial makes the audience focus on what lurks in the shadows even more than on what is in the spotlight.\n\nAudience\n\nOne of the many important details about the way Adidas promotes its products is that it never targets a specific audience. True, sportswear is designed to be suitable mostly for the people who take up sports; however, Adidas was the first to push the envelope and ask a question why other people could not wear sporty clothes.\n\nAs a result, not only does Adidas appeal to a general audience of no particular social status, their age ranging from five to ninety, but also manages to make the idea of being sporty and trim fashionable.\n\nSummary\n\nAlthough initially, sportswear was designed for a very particular set of customers, i.e., the people who took up sports, Adidas made a breakthrough by appealing to every single member of the society, therefore, making the idea of taking up sports attractive to everyone. Such popularization of sports is especially obvious in the given advertisement, seeing how it does not show sportsmen explicitly, only dropping hints at a sports setting.\n\nWith a “Together We Can” catchphrase thrown into the foreground, the company appeals to people’s feeling of solidarity and togetherness, therefore, creating the premises for being supported by a team of enthusiasts instead of individuals, which makes the company all the more influential.\n",
      "Authentic Assessment for ELL Classroom Term Paper\n\nIn order to complete this activity, I will assess an oral language lesson plan using the w and h questions. The main goal of the lesson is to help the students perform tasks that will help them improve their speaking ability. The lesson is specifically meant for learners in grade three to grade five. The wh-movements are used in this lesson to show the interrogative clause.\n\nThey create a special ordering of words that help to achieve the interrogative clause. Examples of the wh-words that are used to form questions in this lesson include: why, where, when, which, what, and whose. The only exception in this category is ‘how’. The students therefore have to be able to use the wh-movement so as to create interrogative clause in a sentence.\n\nTherefore in order to assess the learners’ whole ability, the teacher has to be able to give the students tasks that will ensure they use their ability. For instance, according to the lesson plan, the teacher identifies something in the classroom that the students see every day and then hides it.\n\nThe task is then to ask the students what is missing in the class. This task will ensure that the students speak and not just to mention one word but to describe events and how they happened. The teacher will not only ask the student what is missing from the class, but will also ask them individually when they realized that it was missing and who took it.\n\nIn a normal declarative sentence, the teacher could say something like ‘the chat is pinned on the board’. This sentence has the normal word order whereby it begins with a direct object, a verb and a subject. The teacher could then unpin the chat from the board and hide it. After which the students could be made to use wh-movement to form questions about the chat. Already, the students know some information about the chat.\n\nThey see it pinned to the classroom board daily and they also know its content. However they may not know where it is because it is hidden. The students could then change the sentence order by using the wh-movement words to form an interrogative clause such as this: ‘where is the chat that was pinned to the classroom board?’ another question that could be asked is ‘who took the chat that was pinned to the classroom board?’\n\nThe students can be allowed to form interrogative clauses using any of the wh-movement as long as the question makes sense. Even though the movement of the wh-word can be used differently in subordinate clauses and other relative clauses, the main focus for the lesson would be the main clauses.\n\nThe students have to be able to identify the main verb that moves in the sentence in order to appropriately use the wh-movement at the beginning.\n\nSince the lesson is an oral lesson, then the intonation for the questions asked has to be emphasized. Questions normally have a rising intonation when orally expressed. The teacher has to ensure that the intonation comes out clearly when the students speak out the questions.\n\nFinally, the formed interrogative clauses can also be expressed either as past tense or present tense. Here, the use of auxiliary verbs has to be emphasized since when used with other verbs in a sentence, they help create a tense.\n\nReference\n\nKelley, A. (2010).

      "Grapple Mobile and Its Industry Case Study\n\nIntroduction on Grapple Mobile and its industry\n\nThe cell phone industry is known as one of the fastest growing industries within the global market. Many changes have been recognized within cell phone industry since early 1990s guaranteeing its global expansion. The industry’s market expansion is attributed to the ever improvement in technology and innovation.\n\nCurrent generation desires to live with advancement in technology hence making the cell phone industry to be one of the most important sectors in recent time. Invention of cell phones has led to easy communication and hence success in carriers which requires rapid plans within their processes (International Communications Research, 2007).\n\nMobile applications industry is currently recognized as one of the fastest-growing sectors within the market. According to Forrester Research, the cumulative global downloads is estimated to grow beyond forty four billion mark within the next couple of years. Various brands within the mobile industry are increasing their demand on tablets and smart phones.\n\nThis works well for Grapple mobile since their main focus is on businesses rather than consumers. The other focus of Grapple is on functionality and not so much on novelty hence places greater target on brands dealing primarily with consumers (Bhide, 2008).\n\nExplanation on the type of service, proprietary technology Grapple Mobile offers and its main competitors. What is the business service area that offers the most growth and profits?\n\nGrapple Mobile Company was established in 2010 in London and deals with development of mobile applications for various phones such as iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Nokia as well as other devices. The company deals with the designing of applications for numerous devices within the mobile industry.\n\nOther web technologies used by the firm include; HTML, CSS and JavaScript and deals with every aspect of application development processes such as testing, approval and submission where the company proves the acceptance of applications by operators as well as manufacturers and other stores within the industry.\n\nGrapple makes numerous branded applications (apps) for various commercial companies such as Xbox; BT and HP. Grapple’s propriety technology is capable of translating simple web languages into various native codes. This has made possible the application of multiple mobile platforms.\n\nThe company also provides cloud-based distribution system which makes it easier for clients to download links directly from their mobile phones through a single link. The technology simplifies customer’s journey through handset detection database which delivers correct version of app directly into handsets (Heatley, 2011).\n\nGrapple mobile uses proprietary technology for building cross-platform applications. The company uses development team specialized in building apps for various brands such as iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Nokia, HP as well as windows phone seven. They offer value for customers in their brands offering entertainment such as Zippo lighter and the Carling iPint.\n\nThe technology appears technically brilliant and useful based on the core business objectives. The company at the same time charge their clients on the basis of a one-off fee. This kind of pricing has enabled the consumers to get application that works on hundreds of different phone handsets giving clear guidance from the company concerning concepts and download processes.\n\nThey also provide detailed analytics revealing to the clients the number of times every version has been utilized for the purposes of assisting future marketing activities. The company turned down involvement of VCs since they perceive them as opportunistic of the whole (Heatley, 2011).\n\nGrapple Mobile’s main competitors range from independent mobile application developers to template application platforms. However, the company’s strategy on using full-service agency as well as their platform sets them above their competitors. The level of affordability of the cell phones has made the cell phone industry to expand tremendously.\n\nThis has created a platform for companies to compete within the confines of advance technology and communication. The mobile industry market seems competitive since the companies involved offer the same products and services despite differences in costs and physical attributes.\n\nSome of the companies have resorted to lowering the cost of their improved products for the purposes of attracting more customers. Improved technological know-how enables continuous manufacture of new products making the market for mobile phone industry to be very competitive (Heatley, 2011).\n\nMost of the big mobile phone companies with large economies of scale within the industry provide highly automated services to wide customer base. They also have the advantage of vast financial resources necessary for maintaining communication devices with wide network coverage. This makes them have advantage over the smaller companies such as Grapple Mobile service provider.\n\nThe smaller providers need to franchise out their offices for the purposes of improving on their visibility hence attracting more consumers. The intense competition within the industry has seen increase in annual revenue from the industry with over 1,200 wireless companies. However, individual companies can also improve their profitability by applying the right marketing strategies for their products and services.\n\nAcquiring the right expertise would help improving the cell phone function capabilities. The level of acquisitions and partnership within the industry has led to improvement of wireless technology as well as the associated services. The growth is associated with improved profit margins for service companies which have earlier been mentioned to be conducting lucrative businesses within the various market segments.\n\nSome companies are involved in the creation of models such as Alpha Profit which are necessary within the mobile wireless industry; the industry has received positive growth brought by the introduction of modern phones which uses the third generation wireless networks (Belk, 2006).\n\nAnalysts define the cell phone industry to be in mature life cycle stage since all customers are potential users of the product. The growth of the industry majorly depends on its ability to attract new customers through value-added services including phone securities.\n\nBuyers are normally attracted in two ways within this industry; one way is through service, where cell phones are valued at affordable prices increasing the level of competition amongst companies. Then there is the level of phone innovation which involves addition of more add-on features. The industry contains over fifty companies with the top six controlling 80% of the market (International Communications Research, 2007).\n\nThe technology enhancement within the industry creates similarities in products offered by different companies. There exists variety of products and services making consumers capable of picking their choice of services. Such demands that providers release quality products at reasonable prices.\n\nThe context of the devices means much to consumers, with such qualities as higher resolution and ability of phone to store more data attracting higher demand.\n\nAnalysis of the organizational chart and functionalities enforced by Grapple Mobile\n\nThe company’s organization structure comprises of; the CEO, Head sales, CTO, Platform Engineer, Chief strategy officer, Manager Public Relations, Financial Controller, Manager business Developer, Manager sales, Founder, COO, Chairman and Managing Director.\n\nThe value of the company has so far been valued based on its intellectual assets. The stakeholders are major contributors who should be included within the process of designing activities within business model (Heatley, 2011).\n\nPossible network chart to represent inflows of information as it stands today\n\nThe chart below shows the different processes which Grapple Mobile should use in building information required for the successful operation of their message services. The various organization units involved and their roles are shown as well as the necessary communication links. The level of project management is manned by two individuals with the support of the company’s administration team.\n\nThe top management team is endowed with the responsibility of giving the necessary communication to customers and the suppliers of the services. The suppliers include the mobile network operators as well as the first level operation team.\n\nThe overall managers who include even the CEOs ensure that all the employees within the line of operations receive appropriate information. They are also responsible for financial control and ensuring that the new innovations are implemented.\n\nThe first level support comprises of five team members with different expertise areas. They are normally endowed with the responsibility of obtaining hardware equipments and the system installation processes. The unit creates IT security user accounts and provides consumers with necessary access to the system services.\n\nThe second level support supplies the software and at the same time conducts training to the first level support team. In addition they are responsible for system configuration as well as tracking down errors.\n\nThe server hosting company on the other hand provides equipments required for constructing data centres. The mobile network operator is concerned with delivering appropriate messages to the clients from their operation system and at the same time provides report on delivery of messages.\n\nFigure 1\n\nDiscussion and analysis of the cases indicated in the above discussion and the media through which the various types of information is distributed\n\nThe various types of information are distributed through advanced technology mobile phones which have made possible and accessible the practice of marketing products and service through the internet. The advancements in communication technologies have led to great improvement within the global advertising Industry.\n\nThe methods applied in outsourcing media buying function to the media agencies has since enabled intensive innovation within the company’s core services (The Guardian. 2011).\n\nThere has been increase in the use of various communication tools such as mobile phone and personal computer. This has been made possible by the presence of easily accessible Internet advertising which enables mass adoption of Grapple Mobile services within the Global market. For the purposes of maximizing sales, Grapple Mobile Company pays premium for wide exposure through the mass media.\n\nThe use of mobile phone technology provides common advertising space, but not restricted to the realms of billboards, public transportation, movies, schools, clothing, even bathroom stalls carry ads making the industry to constantly explore new advertising ways. The outflow of information processes is influenced by the nature of technology in use and the consumer’s responses on the products and services within the market.\n\nOutflow of information makes it easier for the companies to differentiate and position their products and services. At the same time it is easier to express quality aspect in a manipulative perspective for the purposes of improving on sales. Marketers within the industry consider with great concern responsibilities they owe to the society (The Guardian. 2011).\n\nThe end result of the information technology presents various challenges to both service providers as well as the consumers in general. The company avoids creating temporal changes which may cause negative results to the society (The Guardian. 2011).\n\nIn addition the various types of information are distributed through various cell phone technologies and innovations. Unlicensed Mobile Access assists in providing necessary high-speed Wi-Fi which enables good coverage within closets of houses. The service enables users of handsets to download programs of their like at satisfying speed even while travelling.\n\nThere is also the use of Cell phone tour guides which directs various buyers on appropriate places making the technology preferable to books since it saves on time and money. Combining iTunes into cell phones presents value added upgrade which all together boosts the sales for the phones within the market.\n\nThe Near Field Communication technology services allows for possible connection through wireless devices enabling transfer of data such as payment information and digital pictures. The services rendered through phones in-built with NFC chips enables use of electronic Identity cards such as debit cards. The technology has since enabled easy transactions to be effected from manufacturers to consumers (The Guardian. 2011).\n\nThere is the use of SkypeIn which enables those who frequently use internet make free access anywhere in the world. Users are enabled to receive regular phone numbers and also able to receive calls without paying for extra charges. There is the possibility of an individual owning more lines within their home countries hence the technology enhances cheaper ways of connecting to each other within the global base.\n\nInclusion of the VOIP within mobile phones assists in cutting out cell-phone bills mostly in international calls which assumes the same data plan in communication line. The service targets travellers, immigrants as well as students from overseas. The service focuses on providing quality voice and providing value-added services (The Guardian. 2011).\n\nAdvancements in Information Communications Technology (ICT) provides good platform for internet services which can easily be incorporated within cell phones. Such advancement has made it possible for other related companies within the industry to execute their services through internet search engines such as Google, Amazon and Yahoo amongst others.\n\nConsumers are capable of accessing information just by clicking required items through websites provided in their handsets. Utilization of information outflows has at the same time enabled popular interactive advertising through blog sites.\n\nThe new trend in communication through improvised networks has given new face to the Information Communication Technology enabling global participation in the mobile phone market. The process at the same time enables easy review and evaluation of the various consumer experiences globally (The Guardian. 2011).\n\nWithin the current technology, the use of Smart phones has eminently dominated the market and this provides Grapple Mobile with the advantage of reinforcing their services, because of the phone’s unique capabilities. Preferably, being considered and valued amongst many as excellent device for provision of information and entertainment to the ever advancing generation.\n\nThe kind of technology embedded within the phone makes it easier the process of installing various applications provided by Grapple as well as disseminating information to the targeted audiences (The Guardian. 2011).\n\nHow Grapple Mobile Company conducts boundary spanning activities around the world\n\nThe recent developments in technology have greatly reshaped the nature of distributed work around the globe especially to companies such as Grapple Mobile. However, research reveals that dispersed works have got various challenges as well as advantages. At times it leads to misattributions and communication breakdowns as well as communication and collaboration.\n\nDespite such problems there is significant rise in company’s functions being performed across the world, since the cost of working in some regions seem affordable contributing to increased globalization hence engaging in distributed work. The idea of spanning boundaries within Grapple Mobile has also contributed towards workers learning across their differences making them more creative and innovative.\n\nGrapple Mobile Company has moved from hierarchical structure towards network based structure which makes it possible for the company to coordinate well with other mobile phone providers (SMS Gateway, 2010).\n\nFigure 2: Boundary spanning knowledge brokering for Grapple Mobile Company\n\nThe company applies the use of informal brokering to pass knowledge across boundaries by first of all identifying the specific technology needed within specific markets. This is followed by the formation of interpersonal relationships with colleagues since diversity and innovation are critical to the development of Grapple’s services.\n\nThe formal brokering is also considered in making administrative work possible in different locations in their defined languages (SMS Gateway, 2010). The various modes of dispersion the company uses have helped in creation of several boundaries such as distal, temporal and disciplinary.\n\nGrapple mobile utilizes increased use interpersonal network necessitated by the use of available technology services. However, the frame of references bridged by broker knowledge tends to differ across locations (Levy, 1999).\n\nThe company’s ability to improvise the use of Information Communication Technology through phones has enabled new and innovative ways of reaching large numbers of potential clients compared to other companies.\n\nThe inclusion of creative technologies such as Ad Words makes it possible for companies to operate online businesses with lots of ease. They also utilize the social sites through the cell phones for the same purpose of capturing the market.\n\nIndication of the challenges the Grapple Mobile organization faces from the competitive and technology standpoint and the possible organization strategies\n\nGrapple Mobile faces the challenge of accommodating the low prices charged by other competitors within the market. There is also possibility of offering low quality services within the industry due to the competition between companies and at the same time dealing with counterfeit products. Lowering costs for services may make Grapple Mobile to lose profits hence reduce their market share.\n\nThe company faces another challenge on dealing with the right people. The services of the company require regular commercial customers. Grapple Mobile needs to build good reputation by positioning as tasty target for acquisition. Mobile users in the market demands more interactivity necessary for sharing and distribution of content (Lakhani and Pannetta, 2007).\n\nThere is clear indication within the market showing that mere use of mobile applications may not lead to direct benefits. The process of adopting Internet applications through the mobile demonstrates fewer benefits in line with reduced transaction costs and improved efficiency.\n\nCo-ordination of services within the industry proves crucial since the use of the Internet through cell phones does not lead to reduction of information sharing costs, but at the same time the services solve much of users reading and interpretation limitations (Slywotzky, 1995). There is also challenge in strategic utilization of business information which is always of the utmost importance to majority of the client.\n\nHowever, Grapple Mobile Company could maximize the use of information transfers which help in establishing benefits from information technology like shorter lead times and affordable batches. The ability to save on time gives an advantage towards efficiency in information sharing which might be of benefit to the company’s operation costs (Lakhani and Pannetta, 2007).\n\nGrapple Mobile could at the same time utilize the concept of integration which enables easier company’s operations within the corporate world. This ensures that the company’s services are provided in full cooperation with other partner mobile phone providers within the industry. The level of consumer demand could be spanned through the use of virtual enterprises via electronic devices.\n\nSuch a trend is capable of creating tremendous changes within the company and at the same time granting competitive advantage. The changes within the Company should incorporate both suppliers within the industry and consumers which may as well ultimately result into reductions in cycle time and the overall cost of operations (Lakhani and Pannetta, 2007).\n\nAt the same time the needs to improve on its boundary spanning techniques which could as well help in the alignment of performance goals across regions through improvement in the level of cooperation. With the improvement in new technologies which enables electronic applications from production level to distribution within the marketplace, Grapple Mobile is able to pre-condition their various management practices.\n\nThe degree of partnerships between the mobile phone service providers and manufacturers determines the probable outcomes within the supply chain hence enabling the integration of the whole processes ensuring quality supplies to consumers (Slywotzky, 1995).\n\nHow Grapple Mobile should be organized in order to efficiently manage inflows and outflows of information\n\nDue to the rapid growth experienced by Grapple Mobile, the process of building a strong reputation, brand awareness and communicating the right messages presents a vital process in the company’s development.\n\nThe company should reinforce the nature of their Public Relations and Marketing Management processes by including a range of ad hoc duties which includes improvement in news searches, writing press releases, arranging and organizing events as well as creating company newsletter.\n\nThere is also the need for Grapple Mobile to indulge in in-depth research concerning mobile related data and at the same time remain relevant to the trends and shifts in the mobile and marketing industries through sales and business news in the corporate world.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn most of the occasions Grapple mobile have focused on creativity which provides appropriate responses to consumers’ technological needs. Such include innovating new methods of mobile phone entertainment. The main issue of focus within boundary spanning activities of Grapple Mobile is creativity.\n\nMajority of the company’s Information Communication Technology wave centres a round the use of internet and Smart phones utilizing their abilities to combine various applications at one point (Levy, 1999).This works well with two-way rather than one-way traditional mass communication methods.\n\nReference List\n\nBelk, J. 2006.

      "International Entry-Mode Choices Report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nIt is surprising that the profitability of large retail booksellers in Japan is relatively poor with their sales being small compared to other countries in the world (Directory of Japanese publishing and bookselling, 1982). One of the major players in the market is the Saihan system that ensures market control by fixing the price of the products in the industry (Directory of Japanese publishing and bookselling: a guide to the market for British books, journals and literary rights in Japan (1 st ed), 1978).\n\nAccording to Farrell, this system deters the entry of new retailers into the bookselling industry, and has often been labeled as “anti-competitive,” and “collusive” (2005, p. 29). A comparison is therefore necessary with other countries and especially the United States to establish the validity and effects of the system to the bookselling market.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe impact that the introduction of the Saihan system in Japan has had on retail booksellers is an issue that has aroused a never-ending debate. As Farrell states, there are advantages and disadvantages of having the system in Japan since the effects are different for the various companies (2005, p. 29). Some of the companies operating in this country include Bookoff and Amazon Japan both of which have recorded mixed returns with the system in place (Govindarajan, & Gupta, 2001, p. 5).\n\nAn evaluation of the effect that the dissolution of the Saihan system would have on the industry is also a spotlight of this paper with the focus being on the two companies. As a board member of Barnes and Noble, I will make an evaluation and feasibility study on the possibility of opening a series of bookstores in the country with the consideration of the Saihan.\n\nBackground\n\nThis paper focuses on the Japanese bookselling industry showing how competitors were able to establish their position within the industry. Japan is a country with a well-developed reading culture with most of her citizens having a habit of reading books of all genres (Directory of Japanese publishing and bookselling 1982). One would therefore expect the book Retail Markets in the country to be well established and profitable given that the culture is a positive one to this industry.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nAccording to the Directory of Japanese publishing and bookselling (1982), the bookselling industry in Japan has a history of diminished returns over the years. A major contributor to this hitch is the restrictive Saihan system (Brewer, Young, & Guisinger, 2003, p. 29).\n\nThe aim is therefore to investigate the feasibility of starting a branch of a multinational bookstore with evaluation of the effects of Saihan system on the other existing bookstores in Japan. The evaluation of the effects that the dissolution of the Saihan system would have on the Japanese retail Booksellers also takes pre-eminence in the essay.\n\nAnalysis of the Problem\n\nAccording to Gurnsey and Henderson, Japanese bookstores are thought to have a prosperous development (1984, p.17). However, in this country, the booksellers suffer low profits with their companies mainly being small scale (Melville, 1999, p. 47). As Melville states, the cause of the problem is mainly the Saihan system (1999, p. 47).\n\nOther factors that have been established as causes of the problems include the return policy and the lack of financial disclosure existing in these firms (Minowa, 1990, p. 97). The Saihan system establishes that the sale of books has to be under the set price with the publishers being responsible for the setting or fixing of the price (Bartlett, & Ghoshal, 1998, p. 19: Womack, 1990).\n\nAs a business rule, new entrants in a market have to use pricing in addiction to other factors to attract new customers and steal those being served by the older firms (Hatch, & Dyer, 2004, p. 29). Japanese retail booksellers are however denied this privilege by the Saihan system, as it is not possible for them to use price as a weapon in the process of competition (Farrell, 2005, p. 48).\n\nThe customers are also described as not being loyal to any of the retailers, as they find no difference in buying from them (Peng, 2001, p. 29). According to Farrell, the sale of the books in Japan is not dependent on a word of mouth, but rather on reviews and advertisement thus meaning that significant revenue goes to advertisement (2005, p. 48).\n\nAs opposed to other regions of the world where financial statements of the companies are readily available to the public, the retail bookselling firms in Japan are not good at disclosing their financial statements (Farrell, 2005, p. 48). The companies are therefore likely to produce figures that are not matching with the actual profits.\n\nAnother problem that Sirmon, Hitt, and Ireland explain is the return policy in the Japan bookselling industry (2007). According to them, retailers can freely return the unsold books to publishers for an equivalent amount of credit (Sirmon, Hitt, & Ireland, 2007). The implication of this strategy is that there is no need for stock inventory and that a bigger scale is necessary (Farrell, 2005, p. 57).\n\nThese are some of the problems that the industry is tolerating with the most significant being the Saihan system. The Saihan system would be illegal in many countries especially in the United States where a policy is in place to guide and control the existing industries. According to Prestowitz, one of the protective factors in the US is the constitution that allows the freedom of starting a profit making organization or company (1988, p. 42).\n\nThe companies’ act that is in place also ensures that would-be retailers are not deprived of their rights. The retail bookselling industry here is also free of any bonds that would restrict new entrants into the industry with the return policy being non-existent (Farrell, 2005, p. 36). This case may explain the performance of the industry.\n\nBookoff and Amazon Japan are some of the companies that have established themselves in the Industry (Farrell, 2005, p. 48). The entry of Amazon into the Japanese bookselling market was met with a big challenge (Farrell, 2005, p. 27). The Saihan provided the most of this challenge (Peng, & Heath, 1996, p. 498). However, Amazon Japan was able to make intelligent adjustments to bypass the system in a bid to ensure profitability.\n\nAccording to Farrell, the company enabled its Japanese clients to purchase books via a series of outlets by paying them through credit cards (2005, p. 31). It also provided free shipping of books to the customer thus enabling the bypassing of the system. Another brilliant idea was the accumulation of points by its customers, which would then be exchanged for books (Farrell, 2005, p. 38).\n\nThe company also bypassed the Saihan by having a third party sales of books through the market sales it organized besides charging a commission on the sale of the books (Farrell, 2005, p. 38). This means that the company was not directly involved in sales, but was benefitting from them, thereby being not guilty as per the Saihan system.\n\nAlternatives and Criteria Selection\n\nThe main consideration for a company to invest in Japan is respect to the set laws and guidelines. The Saihan system and the related laws are just but a few of the examples. The other requirements for a company to invest in the country’s bookselling industry are cautious evaluation of the market dynamics and the existing competition.\n\nSince there is no single company that can claim dominance in the retail bookselling industry in Japan (Peng, & Heath, 1996, p. 498), Barnes and Noble stand a good chance of starting on a profitable path. All that the company requires is the financial input that is directed towards the marketing of its products (Peng, & Heath, 1996, p. 498).\n\nThe company also needs to learn from the previous attempts to penetrate this market. In fact, a good idea would be to use the experience of Amazon Japan. As Yeung states, there is a need to come up with an effective strategy when setting up a business or subsidiaries with the replication of ideas that have worked for other businesses being also accepted (2006, p. 59).\n\nThe company should therefore attempt to start marketing criteria that are close to that of Amazon Japan in an effort to incorporate a strategy that is focused on going round the Saihan system. Barnes and Noble should also diversify on their products in this market.\n\nThe creation of many products has been shown to be a way of obtaining customers’ loyalty, as they can easily get what they are looking for within one roof (Yeung, 2006, p. 17). The formulation of a competition as a marketing strategy where customers would accumulate points and or use them to purchase the commodities is also one of the ways of enhancing profitability (Yeung, 2006, p. 17).\n\nRecommendation\n\nFrom the discussion of the effects of the various factors affecting the retail booksellers in the Japanese market, a number of recommendations emerge. These are related to the theories put forward on marketing and consumer dynamics (Peng, & Heath, 1996, p. 523). A foremost recommendation is the dissolution of the Saihan as a component of the retail bookselling industry in the country.\n\nThis step would increase competition between the companies promoting profitability and or increasing sales (Peng, & Heath, 1996, p. 527). With the dissolution of the Saihan in the country, a number of effects would be felt in the industry and the financial market in Japan in general.\n\nAs stated above, one of the effects would be the development of stern competition between stakeholders in the industry. Competition is a good thing for businesses, as it encourages them to improve efficiency and customer service (Farrell, 2005, p. 67). On the other hand, the retail market bookselling in Japan has largely been in existence with no precise member having an edge over the other due to the restrictions imposed by the Saihan system (Farrell, 2005, p. 67).\n\nWith the dissolution of the system therefore, some of the companies would have an advantage over the others depending on their financial base. This case would mean that the smaller firms are kicked out of the market, as they would not be able to offer a competitive pricing for the books (Farrell, 2005, p. 67).\n\nAnother possible recommendation is the institution of free deliveries and shipping from warehouses in the United States. This strategy would be another way of promoting loyalty and profitability for Barnes and Noble (Acedo, Barroso, Galan, & Ali, 2006, p. 630). The relocation and opening of a branch in this country requires a careful study of the market.\n\nNo company should be in a hurry to do so without doing the necessary groundwork. This argument is also supported by Barney (2001, p. 23) who says that the company should therefore evaluate the consumer profile and preference before setting up a branch here.\n\nAction plan\n\nA possible action plan for the company is considered after the discussion of the Saihan and its effects. A personal recommendation is that Barnes and Noble should not invest in the retail bookselling market in Japan in the current prevailing circumstances. The major deterrence for this decision is the Saihan.\n\nHowever, with the dissolution of the Saihan, this decision would change to facilitate the opening of the branch. Another plan would be to set up a strong marketing team. As suggested by Kotler, for any business to be successful even in the absence of the Saihan, there needs to be an effective marketing plan (1986, p. 17).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Saihan system closely monitors and controls bookselling retail market in Japan. Some of the problems that have compounded to produce the low profits and sales experienced in this industry have also been discussed with appropriate recommendations. With the dissolution of the Saihan system, a personal consideration would be to set up a branch for Barnes and Noble in the country.\n\nReference List\n\nAcedo, F., Barroso, C., Galan, & J., Ali (2006).

      "Criminology: What is the Solution to the Prison Problem? Critical Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Current Problems within U.S. Prisons\n 3. Rehabilitation instead of Incarceration\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe work of Angela Davis in her book, “Are Prisons Obsolete?”, introduces readers to the current state of the U.S. system of imprisonment and rehabilitation. She reveals the correlation between corporate interests, racial profiling, current laws and how such factors have contributed to the growing population of inmates within U.S. penitentiaries.\n\nHer book reveals how rehabilitation practices within prisons at the present are far from promoting a system that helps to transition inmates into normal civilian life.\n\nInstead, what occurs is a removal of civil liberties, the promotion of negative forms of behavior and finally the implementation of prolonged periods of incarceration so that private corporations can make more money and profit off of the inmates at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.\n\nThis was noted in the following statement made by Davis (2003):\n\n“ In arrangements reminiscent of the convict lease system, federal, state, and county governments pay private companies a fee for each inmate, which means that private companies have a stake in retaining prisoners as long as possible, and in keeping their facilities filled” (Davis, 95).\n\nAs such, this paper presents the notion that the current system of rehabilitation within prisons is inherently flawed and needs to be changed in order to resolve the relatively high rates of re-incarceration within the U.S.\n\nBased on this, the assumption of this paper is that by implementing a system that focuses on encouraging better social integration rather than punishment this should help resolve the prison problems within the U.S.\n\nCurrent Problems within U.S. Prisons\n\nBased on the work of Vasiliades (2005), it can be seen that the current state of the U.S. prison system in no way rehabilitates prisoners (Vasiliades, 71-99). In fact Vasiliades (2005) states that prisons actually promote violent behavior resulting in a greater likelihood for those who enter it to get even worse over time. Vasiliades (2005) explains this by stating the following\n\n“…what do you expect would happen if you throw inmates into what is essentially a melting pot of violence and crime with no opportunity for improving their lives once they get out of prison, the obvious outcome would be a smarter and more violent criminal rather than a reformed prisoner that can be integrated into society” (Vasiliades, 71-99).\n\nDavis attempts to explain the inherent failure of society to realize the current problems faced by the prison system by saying that: “this is the ideological work that the prison performs – it relieves us of the responsibility of seriously engaging with the problems of our society, especially those produced by racism and, increasingly, global capitalism” (Davis, 16).\n\nIt is based on the views of Vasiliades (2005) and Davis (2003) that it becomes painfully obvious that some means of change must be implemented in order to resolve the current problem surrounding the current prison system.\n\nGopnik (2012) in his examination of the present day rates of incarceration within the U.S. shows that with the current system of rehabilitation in place, the possibility of re-incarceration is high with the likelihood of a former inmate making his/her way back into the prison system currently being set at 40 to 50 percent (Gopnik, 72-77).\n\nGopnik (2012) even goes on to state that such a rate has increased considerably from 60 to 70 percent; the race, level of education and the absence of any professional skills could be indeed utilized (Gopnik, 72-77).\n\nRehabilitation instead of Incarceration\n\nOne way in which the problems presented by Davis (2003) and Vasiliades (2005) can be resolved is to implement methods or rehabilitation instead of incarceration. This comes in the form of processes and various stages of personality development wherein inmates are modified in such a way that they can easily integrate and adapt themselves back into the society.\n\nOne country in which such a process has proven to be quite effective is the Netherlands wherein their prison system implements a series of steps for modifying behavior and ensuring that prisoners can have a stable and fulfilling life outside of prison.\n\nWhat you have to understand is that based on the studies of Vasiliades (2005), prison life within the U.S. does not prepare prisoners for life outside prison. It is often the case that prison reinforces and even encourages adverse behavior resulting in an inability to live a normal life and a greater propensity to return to a life of crime.\n\nThe Netherlands resolves this issue by providing prisoners with daily psychological sessions, open prison environments, a relaxing atmosphere; they even provide them with the opportunity to obtain a college degree while in prison at the expense of the state.\n\nNot only that, prisoners within such environments are treated as if they are normal individuals as compared to most U.S. prisons where they are treated with a certain degree of disdain. By reinforcing positive behaviors and providing a means by which they can integrate themselves into society, the Netherlands has in effect created a system which has considerably minimized the rate of repeat offenders.\n\nThis has manifested itself in the fact that the Netherlands has one of lowest crime rates in the world with a near nonexistent murder rate. Other countries have similarly tried to adopt such a style of allowing inmates to develop positive behaviors and skills in order to help them transition into society once they get out of jail. The Philippines, for instance, is home to “New Belibid Prison” which is one of the largest jails in South East Asia.\n\nIts size is somewhat misleading though due to the fact that prison officials allow prisoners to construct mini-homes, businesses and even training facilities within the prison.\n\nThis has enabled the prison population to not only develop itself as a community but it has also helped its inmates in internalizing important job and social skills which would greatly assist them once they are released. Combined with the prison’s training program which teaches prisoners an assortment of trades and skills this has resulted in a far lower rate of re-incarceration as compared to their U.S. counterparts.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the presented data it can be seen that by implementing a system that focuses on encouraging better social integration rather than punishment this should help resolve the prison problems within the U.S. as evidenced by the case of the Netherlands and the Philippines.\n\nWhat you have to understand is that the current prison system within the U.S. does not rehabilitate at all and in fact promotes greater instances of criminal behavior. By implementing a system of rehabilitation instead of punishment and incarceration this should greatly reduce repeat offenders within the U.S. prison system.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDavis, Angela. “Are Prisons Obsolete ? .” Publishers Group Canada 1.1 (2003):1- 126.

      "Effective Manager in the Global Context Report\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe world has witnessed radical changes in information and communication technology. As of now, through teleconferencing, individuals from different countries are able to hold a conference from the comfort of their homes or offices without having to travel. Changes in the transport industry has also made is possible for individuals access every part of the globe very fast.\n\nFast jets have made it possible that one can manage to visit all continents of the world within one day. All this changes translate into a different approach to management. Unlike in the traditional setting where geographical constraints limited management scope, the modern manager requires skills to be able to respond to global concerns.\n\nIn this report, I intend to examine competencies and skills of an effective manager in the global context. Through the analysis in this report, I will evaluate my management skills, in order to determine whether I am an effective manager or not. Moreover, based on the analysis of my management skills, I formulate an action plan that I am to implement towards becoming a more competent and effective manager in the global context\n\nTime Management\n\nMost of the managers, who have excelled in their duties, are efficient time managers (Dalziel & Schoonover, 1988). Organizations operating across the globe can only succeed if managers pay close attention to time management.\n\nThis requires taking into account time zone differences and being able to plan so that there are no inconveniences in operation. Efficient time management means that one is able to allocate time properly both in their professional life and in their personal life.\n\nI used to be a victim of poor time management. I was generally a last minute person, which could make my work strenuous and poorly executed. However, over time and through lessons from this module, I have been able to realize the power of excellent time allocation. Currently, am able to work stress free due to planning. Consequently, I am able to execute tasks well in my work place.\n\nTime management is an important component in personal organization. Personal organization dictates the manner one assigns oneself to tasks (Dalziel & Schoonover, 1988). Proper personal organization is not possible without scheduling or time budgeting. However, personal organization goes beyond time management; it encompasses even dressing and how one plans own work desk or home.\n\nProper personal organization skills help one to accomplish tasks in a systematic manner, and in a timely way. I have always taken personal organization seriously because through it I am able to deal with activities and schedules properly.\n\nFrom experience, I know that time management skills are important towards good emotional as well as physical health and stability at work. In all the places that I have worked, I have excelled because of excellent time management. I manage to balance my social life with work life due to proper time management.\n\nThrough the management module, I am now armed with more scientific ways that I can apply towards enhancing my time management skills. I realize that proper time management helps busy employees to create enough time to address to other personal needs e.g. social and emotional needs.\n\nEven though I am excellent at time budgeting, I realized that I would plan but fail in following through with the plans. From the module, I have learned that it is important to have a diary that allows me to plan and stick to the plan made. Moreover, in case I do not meet my diary specifications, I am able to strategize on how to make up for lost time.\n\nCritically, I have learnt to differentiate plans in terms of short-term plan, middle-term plans, and long-term plans. By so doing, I am able to avoid mixing issues and prioritizing. This aspect is very significant because it has enabled me to have a daily time management strategy that does not jeopardize my long term or midterm needs.\n\nProject Management\n\nIn this module, I have managed to learn more on the management functions, which are vital to the field of project management. As Witzel (2003, pp.96-101), discusses, project management is a very dynamic undertaking.\n\nThere are many project management tools that I have been able to learn from this course. For example, I have leant how to apply Gantt charts, mind maps, as well as knowledge development to ensure project success. Project management is taken seriously globally due to increased demand for managers to respond to competition and other market trends (Meredith & Mantel, 2010).\n\nApart from the tools used in project management, the module has helped to appreciate the dynamics of managing an international project. In day-to-day operations of an organization, managers often rely on ad-hoc information to make tactical decisions on matters that require immediate response.\n\nIn a global context, this means managers have to institute proper feedback mechanisms and invest in information technology. Information technology tools would help a project manager of a widespread project to remain in touch with project assistants. This is pivotal, as there are often urgent decisions that have to be made.\n\nStress Management\n\nAnother critical skill I have learnt during the model is how to go about stress management. I realize that many people labor with effects of stress and yet as Lazarus and Folkman (1984) point out, stress is something that one can control. From the module, I have learnt that stress comes because of many factors.\n\nThe common causes of stress include problems in personal relationships, financial difficulties among others. Stress can emerge due to insecurity in one’s jobs, problems in controlling staff, or other issues to do with family or work roles.\n\nLearning on how to manage stress is mandatory for every effective manager because normal day to day work experiences translate into forms of stress (Bower & Segerstrom, 2004, pp.9-11). As illustrated in the module classes, planning is central to the management of stress. Therefore, to avoid stress, I ensure that I plan and handle my assignments in good time.\n\nFurther, I have come to understand different ways of coping with others especially when working in groups. Sometimes, working in groups may lead to delays in the accomplishment of the required assignments. In dealing with others, I have learnt ways of detecting signs of stress and thus I am able to act upon them fast before they turn me into a stressed individual.\n\nInterpersonal Skills\n\nManagement in a global context often means working with people from different nations. A cultural difference across nations means that different people approach business and even social interactions very differently. Therefore, managers in a global context have the challenge of being able to transform cultural diversity into a strength rather than a weakness; cause of conflicts in the organization.\n\nEffective management is about weaving together a dream team or being part of a dream team than helps an organization to achieve its objectives (Dixon, 2004). Interpersonal skills are poignant in ensuring a good working relationship with others. I belief I have very excellent interpersonal skills that I have demonstrated through my various encounters with people at organizational level.\n\nIn my daily encounters, I find it easy to communicate freely in groups. I am also capable of establishing rapport quickly with people, which always puts me at an advantaged position in as far as working with others is concerned.\n\nHowever, this module has endowed me with deeper insights into the realm of interpersonal skills, by making me realize that I can as well use my interpersonal skills to enable other group members who are introverts to express themselves and share their own opinions before any group. Furthermore, I have learned about the various barriers to effective interpersonal relationships, and ways to overcome those barriers.\n\nAnother aspect that normally puts individuals at loggerhead with others is not knowing how to ask questions in groups (Dixon, 2004). This is because at times some questions can send out negative signals, hence barring effective interpersonal relationships. I have realized that what I need to improve on is my listening skills so that I can be able to learn from other people.\n\nConclusion\n\nManaging in a global context requires one to have dynamic skills due to the challenges resulting from global diversity. It is imperative for a manager in the global context to have sharp interpersonal, project management, time management and stress management skills.\n\nAs presented in this report, it is clear that I have learnt a lot from the management module. From the module, I have come to appreciate the complexity of a global managing context.\n\nHowever, I am encouraged because I have also learnt a number of techniques that will help me become a competent and effective manager in the global context. In line with the course content, I have been able to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses. Based on such an analysis, I have come up with an action plan, which will enable me to improve and increase my competence.\n\nAction Plan\n\nI appreciate that I can be an effective manager but there are areas in which improvements are necessary. The following action plan looks at what steps I am going to take to ensure the journey of growth continues. To better appraise my strengths and weakness, below is a SWOT model of the same.\n\nStrengths                                                                        Opportunities                                                                                    \n  * I plan my time                                                                 * I have learnt how to use diary and other tools in time management                            \n  * I have learnt different project management tools                               * I have learnt about many project management tools e.g. Gantt charts                          \n  * I have capacity to identify stressors                                          * I have learnt about stressors and organizational stress management programs                  \n  * I am an extrovert and always engages others                                    * Opportunity to learn more about others                                                       \nWeakness                                                                         Threats                                                                                          \n  * I do not follow through on plans                                               * Cultural animosity in the world                                                              \n  * Lack experiences in using project management tools                             * Ever changing project management tools minimizing my competence                              \n  * Lack experience developing stress management programs for big organizations    * Numerous stressors in global context                                                         \n  * I tend not to listen to other in interpersonal interactions                    * People who do not appreciate value of interpersonal relations; hardliners in the global arena\n\n\nGrowth Objectives\n\nBased on the SWOT model presented above, the following are my growth objectives\n\n  * To work on time management skills\n  * To improve my listening skills thus improve my interpersonal skills\n  * To practice with project management skills so as to become competent in their use\n  * To learn more about how stress management programs are organized in multinational corporation\n\nShort Term Actions\n\nInterpersonal skills are elementary for any effecting manager. I believe that I am an extrovert and thus I tend to dominate others whenever in groups. To start with, when it comes to performance management there is the temptation to manage people’s performance from a personal perspective. This means that they regard their own competencies and skills as perfect.\n\nHowever, owing to the class module, I have learnt that it is critical to open up to others’ ways of doing things as long as they stick to the organizational objectives. Consequently, I will work tirelessly towards being someone who appreciates other people’s point of view.\n\nI will begin this through, on a daily basis, trying to empathize and understand others in the context of their competencies. Rather than manage performance by harassing others based on their capability, I have to learn how to motivate them and encourage optimism so they may bring their best to the fore. This I kind of disposition I plan to build by practicing the same consciously until I internalize the same.\n\nReflecting on my capability to manage stress, I also have enough that I ought to look into. I am happy that I have learnt a lot about how to identify stressors and manage stress at a personal level. However, I need to learn more in terms of how to design and institute stress management mechanisms in organizations that are operating internationally.\n\nAll managers have to learn not only how to effectively deal with stress at a personal level but also in an organization. On a daily basis, I plan to come up with a personal program of managing stress. If the program works for me, then I could easily transform the same into an organization wide stress management program. However, I am well aware that people are different.\n\nAway from stress management, my action plan is not complete without considering how I am going to improve my project management skills. In the module, I learnt more about how to handle projects. However, effective use of given tools comes with experience.\n\nI have to start practicing how to employ tools like balanced scorecard and other qualitative tools necessary in management. Using readily available scenarios, I plan to continue applying the tools with the aim of internalizing the same. While the other activities require daily efforts, on the use of the tools, I plan to exercise using them at least once every week.\n\nLong Term Action\n\nI need to grow interpersonal skills especially in appreciating how cultural diversity may become a barrier to effective management. In the globalizing management setting, managers have to interact with people of different nationality and cultural backgrounds.\n\nTherefore, I have to continually learn about other people and their way of life. By so doing, I will be able to know how to approach and interact comfortably with them. I plan to start reading more about how people from other cultures do business and how they respond or interact.\n\nWhen it comes to time management, my long-term plan is augment long-term planning in my time management schemes. Through strategic planning, I am able to take a panoramic approach to operations thus guaranteeing that nothing of value is excluded from my priorities.\n\nIn relation to stress management, my long-term plan, as an effective manager, I will keep learning more about stressors and what kind of programs can help in eradicating the given stressors. I plan to take time to identify case studies on stress management towards better understanding of how the same is handled in other companies.\n\nFinally, in relation to project management skills, my long-term plan is to enroll into institutions o learning at a later stage to augment my knowledge and skills in the use of different skills.\n\nReferences\n\nBower, J.

      "Kraft Foods Group: Management Case Study\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nKraft Foods Group is one of the largest food companies in the world. The company has had its success due to a number of factors. For instance, the company has one of the best human resources. It respects its employees and encourages them to give the best to the organization. The culture of Kraft Foods Group also gives the company a competitive advantage.\n\nIts mission statement, vision and values, as well as the strategies are all in line with the company’s business. They have also been vital to its success. Kraft Foods Group has a culture whereby it is always committed to its social responsibility and ensuring that the community gets a good lifestyle. In doing so, it offers food stuffs that are healthy and of high quality.\n\nThe company also treats its employees and customers the best way possible. Kraft can improve on its current strategies to make it much better.\n\nThis report will focus on how the current organization design, system and culture contribute to the implementation of its strategies and whether they fit the mission statement. The paper will then give recommendations on changes that can be made to improve the performance of Kraft Foods Group.\n\nOrganizational design\n\nAn organization should ensure that it has a design that facilitates the running of its business. It is important to note that the organizational design contributes to its success (Luca, 2009). For instance, a good organizational design is important in improving communication among customers, employees, managers and other stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, communication is a key factor to the success of an organization. Kraft Foods Group has an organizational design that is usually decentralized. There are various divisions, each of which is headed by a director. The overall organization is headed by the CEO. The CEO communicates to the country directors who then communicate with the division managers.\n\nDivision managers then communicate to the employees. However, decision making is centralized. This is important in that it ensures fast decision making. It saves on time and costs associated with decision making. The organizational design of this company helps it in implementing its strategies in that each division director is given a chance to make his or her contribution regarding their divisions.\n\nThe director presents the issues of their divisions to the planning committee. Strategic plans are then made on how to improve business in the various divisions (Garrow & Hirsh, 2008). It is important to note that each division has its own business issues that should be addressed differently.\n\nSystems, on the other hand, also play an important role in implementing the organization’s strategies. Effective systems ensure that strategies are implemented effectively and that this is done in the right way. For instance, some money might be needed for strategies to be effective. Therefore, the systems used in budget preparation should provide the required cash to ensure that the strategy becomes successful.\n\nIn addition, the systems are also effective in ensuring that employees get the best treatment from the organization. It is imperative to note that the employees are the ones who contribute to the success of the organization. An organization can never move forward without employees.\n\nTherefore, there should be better performance appraisal systems that will help in motivating employees. Once employees are motivated, they will support the strategies and make it easy for the strategies to be implemented (Heneman, Fisher & Dixon, 2001).\n\nHuman resources are the most important resources in any organization. They are assets to an organization and they facilitate its success. No organization can succeed without the right human resource in place. Kraft Foods Group respects its human resource capital and recognizes that it is because of the people that it has been able to reach where it is today.\n\nThe quality of its employees, their knowledge and expertise are crucial factors to successful strategy implementation. The company is, therefore, usually committed to ensure that all its employees are treated well.\n\nThis makes the employees feel comfortable, satisfied and able to give their all to the organization. Therefore, human resources have a positive effect on the implementation of Kraft Foods Group strategies (Garrow & Hirsh, 2008).\n\nCulture is another factor that cannot be ignored when a company wants to implement a new strategy. There are cultures that are rigid, while others are flexible. Today, the business environment is highly dynamic and organizations should have cultures that embrace change to be able to implement strategies that would facilitate success.\n\nKraft Foods Group has a culture that encourages diversity. In addition, its culture is committed to ensuring the wellbeing of customers. Diversity has the ability to bring success to an organization. For instance, hiring different people will increase the chances of innovative ideas being brought forward.\n\nFurther, a diverse workforce will bring together a wide pool of knowledge, thus more and better strategies can be proposed and implemented. Kraft’s concern about the community and the wellbeing of its customers has created a loyal consumer base. When customers are loyal to an organization’s products and services, they easily support any proposed strategies and ease the implementation process (Pryor et al. 2009).\n\nFit or the lack of fit between the company’s mission, strategy, and organizational components crucial to implementation\n\nThe mission of Kraft Foods Group is: “to be North America’s Best Food & Beverage Company” (Kraft, 2013). For the company to be the best, it has to implement the best strategies and be composed of the best organizational components. Kraft aims at providing high quality foods to customers, as well as offering the best services.\n\nThe company is concerned about the health of customers by ensuring that its foods are good for consumers’ health. It is expected that all the activities and strategies carried out by the company should be in line with this mission. There is a fit between the mission, strategy and organizational components at Kraft Foods Group. The company implements strategies that are aimed at ensuring high quality foods and services.\n\nFor instance, it hires employees who are highly qualified. Such employees are able to produce high quality foods since they have the knowledge and skills to do so. In addition, they are in a better position to offer high quality services.\n\nOne of the ways that a company can become the best is by building a strong brand image. Kraft Foods Group has been in the frontline in building a strong brand image through its corporate social responsibility (CSR). This is a strategy that is highly effective in winning the trust of customers and making the company the best.\n\nKraft Foods Group helps in the fight against hunger and at the same time promotes good and healthy lifestyles amongst the people. Kraft Foods Group is committed to eradicating food insecurity. It does this by offering its expertise to create recipes that are affordable to any person (Kraft, 2013).\n\nThe company has also been working with organizations that fight against hunger in order to give its helping hand. Kraft Foods Group is a neighbor that the community can look upon in times of disasters.\n\nThrough this strategy, it has been able to create a good brand image and live to its mission of becoming the best in North America. The CSR components complement the strategies since they have contributed to the success of Kraft Foods Group. Over the recent past, the company has been working on changing its culture in order to make it better and more successful in the current business environment (Kraft, 2013).\n\nRecommendations/ changes I would make as a CEO\n\nKraft Foods Group has been at the top of the industry in America and in other parts of the world. Its strategies have complemented its business and have been the key to its success. The company has had the best human resource; its organization structure is favorable and has systems that positively impact its business.\n\nKraft Foods Group strives to become the best in North America and the rest of the world. The strategies set and those being set facilitate this course. However, as a CEO there are some few things I would do differently to make the company much better. Some of the changes I would make are discussed below.\n\nThe organization structure is decentralized. However, the decision making process is centralized. I would decentralize the decision making process if I were the CEO of Kraft Foods Group. The company is committed to diversity and employs people from different ethnicities and races. This increases the chances of hiring an employee base that has a wide pool of knowledge and ideas.\n\nIn addition, the company hires employees who have high qualifications, knowledge and expertise. Therefore, there are chances that better decisions would be made if the decision making process is decentralized. The process might take time, but the end result will be worth the time. The various knowledge and skills will be brought together and come up with better solutions to problems.\n\nThe directors of various divisions should be involved in the process. They should also be given the mandate to make decisions related to their divisions. Employees should be involved too.\n\nThis would not only facilitate better decisions, but it would also motivate the employees. Employees would be in a better position to support the decisions that they are involved in making. At the same time, they would feel they are part of the organization.\n\nAnother change that I would make is that I would introduce products and services that favor all classes of people. The company is currently known for producing high quality foods that are costly. I would add a low cost strategy to the current differentiation strategy to attract all classes of people. The company will be producing quality products but at a relatively low cost under the low cost strategy.\n\nSuch products would not be of high quality like the differentiated products, but they would also be worth the relatively lower cost. I would, therefore, change the differentiation strategy and make it a focus strategy. In this regard, the company would focus on various market segments and produce goods depending on the needs of those customers.\n\nReferences\n\nGarrow, V., & Hirsh, W. (2008).

      "Identity Theft: Identity Fraud and the Data Breaches Essay\n\nIdentity theft is an act of stealing someone else’s identity with the intention of accessing resources or any other benefits that may come from using the victim’s name. People or even organizations can be faced with adverse consequences should they fall victims of these identity fraudsters.\n\nIdentifying the connection between the identity fraud and the data breeches is always a very hard task since it is never easy determining how the theft was executed. An unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University affirms that in many cases, the reasons for identity theft are never identified but chances of falling victim to identity theft stands at around 2% (Michelle, 2000).\n\nWith the advent of technology, identity theft has been made even much easier to the fraudsters. Hackers now have access to very malicious software and applications. There even exists such application as ‘interested in credit card theft?’ This reveals the ease with which the identity thieves can access all sorts of information online.\n\nAn example of an identity theft is the case of Abraham Abdalla of Brooklyn, also known as the bus boy. He went online to access people’s private financial details. The victims included among the wealthiest people in America. He even had Oprah Winfrey’s and Steven Spielberg’s credit cards and financial information.\n\nHowever, his days were numbered and he was caught while he was attempting to make one of the largest transactions. It was referred to as a software giant. This and a multitude of various other cases occur every other day.\n\nHow would you protect cooperate executives from fraudulent acts against them?\n\nCooperative executives are at a great risk of falling victims to identity theft. This is so majorly because of the largesse that they always hold in the form of personal and organizational resources. This may consequently lead to large and even irrecoverable personal and organizational losses.\n\nBefore coming up with ways and measures of curbing identity theft that may be targeted on the executives, it is necessary to identify the modes and means by which the theft may be executed. It is also very important to note that fraudsters begin by obtaining personal and confidential information of their victims. Thus, it is vital to note some of the ways in which personal identifiers may fall in the hands of the fraudsters.\n\nIn order to obtain the confidential information, the identity thieves may apply various acts. One of the acts include rummaging through rubbish at dumpsites to access dumped documents which could containing their target victim’s information or rather – in this case – the executive’s information. These are the so-called dumpster divers.\n\nRedundant IT equipment may also serve as a rich source of information to the fraudsters. These equipments may include, amongst many others, storage media such as flash disks and other memory sticks, hard drives and mobile phones. All these equipments, when carelessly disposed of, may be the genesis of grave problems.\n\nIdentity thieves can also observe as someone types their login details in an attempt to log into their private sites in publicly situated IT devices such as computers or even ATMs. The identity thieves, in order to obtain confidential data, may also use sophisticated means such as the hand held card readers that are able to skim through and avail details from a credit card (Austin & Carr, 2002).\n\nTo retrieve confidential data online, the identity thieves can use spyware or even hack into computers and databases to obtain volumes of information. Certain software can be access by hackers and can even be used by amateur hackers to break into and retrieve information from their accomplices’ computers.\n\nAdditionally, the fraudsters can attack weak passwords and gain access into an executive’s details that are found online. The fraudsters do this through well-calculated guess works to crack weak passwords.\n\nTherefore, the big question becomes, how can cooperate executives protect themselves and their organizations against the identity thieves? It is important to note that the fraudsters acquire personal information or rather personal identifiers through serious breaches (Neal, 2002).\n\nIt is also important to affirm that in most cases, it is as a result of an individual’s naivety or ignorance that the identity thieves find it easy to carry out their heinous acts. Ignorance and naivety may lead to mishandling of vital personal and even organizational details.\n\nTo avert this crime, the executives should avoid unnecessary introductions or identification of themselves at bogus avenues. This is basically known as risk avoidance (Johnson, 2006). There is need to be very cautious about IT systems that require or demand excess amounts of personal information such as national identification numbers or even social security numbers.\n\nElectronic identity theft can be mitigated by maintaining computer security. An example includes fully patching the operating systems and thus protecting them from intrusion by security threats.\n\nComputer systems’ security can also be fortified by running antivirus software to expel any malware or spyware that may be used by identity thieves to obtain information. Recently, there were insurance service providers who not only purport to protect against identity fraud but also to identify when an identity theft had occurred.\n\nSome other basic measures to avert executives’ identity theft are to ensuring that all waste documents containing confidential information are shredded before they are dumped. All organizational networks should be completely secured. The executives’ computers, laptops or any other portable IT devices should be strongly encrypted to protect information in case the devices are stolen.\n\nMeasures to ensure that the identity-theft mitigation measures are upheld\n\nFrom the above scenario, we can effectively learn that apart from the executive ensuring security of personal details, various other persons within an organizational setup also carry the role of upholding the organization and even the executives’ details security (Dick, 2006).\n\nThese persons may include office secretaries, the company IT persons, mobile phone service providers, and many other stakeholders. It is consequently important that an awareness program be carried out in order to educate these groups of individuals on how to work against identity fraud.\n\nThe education and awareness program would be carried out in the form of a workshop whereby all these groups of persons would be invited. The workshop would touch on issues such as appropriate paper and equipment dumping procedures, IT systems security, importance of risk avoidance and many other propositions.\n\nIn order to ensure that the proposed measures of averting identity fraud are upheld, it would be necessary to put everyone on toes. The departmental heads can effectively do this.\n\nThe departmental heads may in turn appoint monitors who would ensure that the agreed on steps are upheld and reports made on a daily or weekly basis. For example, it would be important to assign someone the job of ensuring that all waste paper and equipment are free of confidential information.\n\nReferences\n\nAustin, J., & Carr, J. (2000).

      "Personality Tests and Employee Selection Report (Assessment)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Personality Tests\n 2. Projective and Objective Tests\n 3. Behavioral Measures\n 4. Standardized Personality Tests\n 5. APA Guidelines\n 6. References\n\nPersonality Tests\n\nAccording to Krilowicz and Lowery (1996), “the determining force behind the effectiveness of an organization is the quality of its human resources” (p. 55). The personality tests are the techniques that enable organizations to make a reasonable decision regarding the employee selection and, therefore, they are beneficial to a significant extent.\n\nAccording to research findings, personality affects the job performance and work productivity significantly (Krilowicz & Lowery, 1996, p. 55). The interest towards the pre-employment personality testing is continuously growing. By uncovering the personal traits of a potential employee, the organizations attempt to increase the overall organizational performance and achieve the long-term positive financial results.\n\nAny job implies the individual’s ability to fulfill particular tasks and duties both physically and mentally. In this way, the individual differences make some people more appropriate for working in the position of the security guard than others.\n\nAlong with the job interviews, the organizations commonly implement various instruments for assessment of personal skills and knowledge of the future employees. Personality testing provides evidence supporting or disapproving individual’s self-presentation and makes managerial decision-making more valid. It may be regarded as the main strength of the personality testing in the employee selection process.\n\nAccording to Bouton and Moore (2011), “the most ominous business concern of using the wrong assessment is the risk of discrimination litigation” (p. 144). First of all, the testing and personality assessment instruments must meet the legal regulations, and they must ensure that the choice is made in correspondence with the principles of equality and ethics.\n\nThe limitations of personality testing are also related to the fact that testing allows analyzing the personal traits on the surface level and doesn’t necessarily help to predict the patterns of the individual’s behavior development in the future (Goffin et al., 2011, p. 646).\n\nThe development of the personality testing criteria is essential to the receiving of reliable and valid testing results. The employee selection criteria are usually based on organizational values, missions, and visions, and the traditional job requirements (Bouton & Moore, 2011, p. 145).\n\nA potential employee is expected to be able to execute the job-related tasks and fulfill the necessary responsibilities. In their research, Bouton and Moore (2011) recommend using “a suite of three instruments including a behavioral assessment, a motivation or values instrument, and a judgment style piece” because they were found to be very precise and based on reasoning (p. 145).\n\nOne of the most frequently used personality assessment instruments in the working settings is the TEA Personality Test that is represented in the questionnaire format (Arribas-Aguila, 2011, p. 121).\n\nAccording to the findings of the Spanish researchers, the TEA Test’s psychometric properties are characterized by a high level of “construct validity, factorial solution fitness,” and reliability (Arribas-Aguila, 2011, p. 121). According to the research findings, the TEA subtests’ reliability values were ranged from 0.55 to 0.86 Cronbach’s alpha, and the given coefficients were higher than the coefficients reported in the test’s technical manual (Arribas-Aguila, 2011, p. 123).\n\nDespite the fact that personality assessment is proved to be helpful in employee selection process, some researchers claim that personality and behavioral measures have low levels of reliability and validity (Morgeson et al., 2007, p. 1032).\n\n“Scores on personality inventories are likely to be correlated with a number of variables that are of interest to organizational researchers;” although the scores may be relevant for investigation of employees’ behavior within the organizations, they are considered to be “poor predictors of criteria such as job performance and are difficult to justify as the basis for making high-stakes decisions about individuals” (Morgeson et al., 2007, p. 1032).\n\nIt is also observed that the correlations between the working performance and personality measures estimated through the meta-analysis remained consistently low. Therefore, Morgeson and colleagues (2007) recommend the organizational managers to take the low validity levels into consideration during the application of the personality testing, interpretation of scores, and the decision-making.\n\nProjective and Objective Tests\n\nIn the personality assessment practice, the tests are divided into two major groups: objective and projective. According to Meyer and Kurtz (2006), “the term objective typically refers to instruments in which the stimulus is an adjective, proposition, or question that is presented to a person who is required to indicate how accurately it describes his or her personality using a limited set of externally provided response options” (p. 223).\n\nThe instruments of objective personality testing include multiple-answer questionnaires (yes/no, true/false), Likert scale, and others. The given instruments are called objective because their interpretation and analysis are not dependent on the personal judgment that implies a high level of subjectivity.\n\nIn objective tests, the answers are scored according to the preliminarily established patterns (Meyer & Kurtz, 2006, p. 223). The interpretation of objective tests is based on the comparison with the related previous normative results, and it is the examiner’s responsibility to identify the extent to which the assessed personality matches the normative characteristics.\n\n“The term projective typically refers to instruments in which the stimulus is a task or activity that is presented to a person who is required to generate a response with minimal external guidance or constraints imposed on the nature of that response” (Meyer & Kurtz, 2006, p. 223). The lack of external guidance in the projective tests implies the presence of ambiguity in the way the test’s questions are formed. Through answering such ambiguous questions, an individual reveals his/her personal traits.\n\nAccording to the idealistic understanding of the concept of objective test, the results received through the application of this method must be characterized by excellent reliability and accuracy rates. The term of objective test substantially excludes the biasing effects and misinterpretation of scores.\n\nHowever, in practice scoring and interpretation errors occur frequently and become a concern of multiple research studies. Moreover, the “frank distortion” in answering the questions leads to misinterpretation of scores and reduction of test’s objectivity and level of precision (Meyer & Kurtz, 2006, p. 223).\n\nIn the projective tests, it is expected that a person will project her personal traits and features through response to the specifically designed situations and conditions. However, not all the testing instruments that are meant as projective necessarily meet the requirements of the term.\n\nFor example, according to Meyer and Kurtz (2006), “responses to the Rorschach inkblots often have more to do with stimulus classification and problem solving styles than to projection” (p. 224). Rorschach’s test is also characterized by a high level of response variability and complexity that may interfere with the successful interpretation of the scores.\n\nAccording to Sartori (2010), the personality tests may be divided into two groups according to their internal characteristics of efficiency and aesthetics (p. 757). “Projective techniques seem more beautiful, mysterious, interesting and attractive (aesthetic assessment), while psychometric tests seem more credible, transparent, repeatable, liable to falsification and scientific (efficacy assessment)” (Sartori, 2010, p. 757).\n\nAccording to the investigation of the face validity (extent to which the test seem to be valid to the participants) of both tests, from the overall sample of 238 individuals, the projective tests were preferred by 124 examinees while the objective (psychometric) tests were chosen by 38 people (Sartori, 2010, p. 758). The participants of the study found projective tests such as Rorschach’s test more attractive and curious and believed that these tests can reveal their personality more effectively.\n\nBehavioral Measures\n\nThe psychological testing may be extremely useful for the selection of the security forces personnel because it can allow organizations to avoid the undesirable results through prediction of the individual’s performance and behavior. According to Forero, Gallardo-Pujol, Maydeu-Olivares, and Andrés-Pueyo (2009), “the Five Factor personality model” that is used “as a communication tool between professionals on personality results” helps to predict the multiple dimensions of individual’s performance and abilities (p. 592).\n\nThe model allows assessment of such criteria as openness, consciousness, activity, and vulnerability, and through evaluation of the given aspects of individual’s test performance, it is possible to measure and predict his/her behavior in the workplace.\n\nAccording to Forero and colleagues (2009), the personal traits (openness, positive emotions, vulnerability, etc.) are “important personality factors” for police and security forces’ job performance (p. 593). By focusing on these personality patterns in relation to discipline and personal motivation, it is possible to assess the potential employee’s behavior and level of fitting to the position requirements.\n\nStandardized Personality Tests\n\nAccording to Barrett and colleagues (2003), the standardized tests that may be implemented in the law enforcement or security selection battery include the Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Clinical Interview, the Personal History Questionnaire, Psychological Inventory, and the 16 Personality Factor (p. 498). According to Forero and colleagues (2009), the given tests are characterized by the adequate reliability and data validity – in a short-term interval, the average test-retest reliability coefficient in the study was 0.83 (p. 593).\n\nThe standardized TEA Personality Test may also be included in the employee selection battery. The test is designed to assess the dimensions of emotional stability, openness, and responsibility. The test’s normative data is based on “a representative sample of 15,509 adults in the work context (23.3% males and 76.6% females)” (Arribas-Aguila, 2011, p. 122).\n\nAPA Guidelines\n\nAccording to American Psychological Association (2016a), one of the purposes of the personality assessment is “increase the accuracy of behavioral prediction in a variety of contexts and settings” (par. 1). However, the efficiency of the assessment procedures depends on the level of psychologist’s competence and knowledge of the tests’ psychometric properties, issues of validity and reliability, limitations, group norms, etc.\n\nAccording to American Psychological Asscoication’s standard 2.01 “Boundaries of Competence” (2016b), “psychologists provide services, teach and conduct research with populations and in areas only within the boundaries of their competence” (par. 6). Therefore, it is important to be aware of one’s gaps in knowledge related to personality testing. In case a psychologist doesn’t have sufficient expertise, it is recommended for him/her to refrain from the conduction of test. Otherwise, the scores may be misinterpreted, and the standards of professional behavior will be violated.\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Psychological Association. (2016a). Personality Assessment .

      "Usage of Renewable Energy in Saudi Arabia Report\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper constitutes a report based on data available at Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3; the figures from these tables have been developed to reflect usage of Renewable Energy (RE) electricity as the optimal source for sustaining power demand in Saudi Arabia. The scenario supposes that Concentrated Solar Energy (CSP) technology has a more effective potential for sustainability the kingdom’s electricity at the least cost.\n\nThe report also reflects on RE economics where the instance of KA-Care has been revised to examine the model for electric energy demand (and factors influencing the demand; such as efficiency gains and population), as well as the supply model (that has been developed to reflect the portfolio of the basic energy success). Supply is assumed to meet demand for the benefit of power balances that stands at a firm capacity of peakload x 125%.\n\nYear                          2009     2010     2011     2012     2013     2014     2015     2020   \nConsumption (gwh)                                                                                   \nIndustry                      21,506   22,071   23,117   24,190   25,399   26,742   28,060   35,475 \nTransport                     0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0      \nResidential                   104,935  113,510  121,907  130,869  140,410  150,471  161,074  214,935\nCommercial & public services  51,655   54,253   57,772   61,653   65,230   68,973   72,845   94,365 \nOther                         21,938   23,207   24,531   25,922   27,364   28,864   30,420   38,491 \nTotal                         200,034  213,040  227,327  242,634  258,403  275,050  292,400  383,265\n% change, year on year        7.1      6.5      6.7      6.7      6.5      6.4      6.3      5.7    \nCapacity (mwe)                                                                                      \nCombustible fuels             44,485   48,386   50,746   53,926   57,451   60,841   68,441   77,053 \nNuclear                       0        0        0        0        0        0        0        1,000  \nHydro                         0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0      \nNon-hydro renewable           0        0        0        0        25       25       55       555    \nSolar                         0        0        0        0        25       25       55       555    \nNet maximum                   44,485   48,386   50,746   53,926   57,476   60,866   68,496   78,608 \n\n\nTable 1: A reflection of Saudi Arabia electricity consumption and supply\n\nTable 1 comprises of data from the year 2009 to 2020 and shows energy consumption at various levels of economy such as industrial, residential, transportation, and commercial/ public services.\n\nThe table shows a steady increment in consumption at the various levels whereas the transport sector is envisaged not to use solar energy, however. The increment in demand at the other sectors reflects predicted population and economic increases.\n\nThe Functionality of Renewable Energy: Concentrated Solar Energy (CSP) in Focus\n\nIt is usual that several people limit solar energy to the use of photovoltaic panels which are commonly located on rooftops and power very limited facilities (Zalba 253). The reason for this is based on the fact that usage of the panels or similar devices for acquiring electric energy has been more common, and perhaps is at very cheap costs. Solar energy however has wider applications, including CSP.\n\nFigure 1 shows a Parabolic Trough System as a CSP unit; most of these units are usually quite large installations which cover several acres and constitute reflective mirrors as collecting units which convey sun rays based on their orientation (Iorfa 56; Mills 23). Performance effectiveness is largely dependent on amount of temperature and design of the trough (Mills 283).\n\nFigure 1. Parabolic Trough System Schematic Diagram\n\nThe receiving units comprises of a heat absorbing unit (this is otherwise known as the heat transfer fluid) that could be transferred to a storage device some place away. The workability of CSP is also achieved through Power Tower and Dish Engine systems as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.\n\nFigure 2: (A) Power Tower Schematic Diagram (B) Dish/engine System Schematic Diagram\n\nAlthough, these systems vary structurally from one another, the general working principles are similar which involve the conversion of energy from the sun the electric energy, and are quite economical in terms of environmental friendly, management and maintenance. It is this energy systems that has been propose for usage in Saudi Arabia as show in Table 1 above.\n\nRationale for Using CSP as an Electric Energy Alternative in Saudi Arabia\n\nThe tendency of CSP to generate very minimal greenhouse-gas emissions makes it highly adoptable anywhere in the world especially in the present society where there is a very high demand for safe energy as an alternative to mitigation of climatic changes.\n\nThese energy alternatives are flexible in terms of enhanced security, and have ‘an inherent capacity to store heat energy for short periods of time for later conversion to electricity’ (Forsberg et al. 141).\n\nIn combination with thermal storage devices, concentrated solar energy could be able to generate electricity continually even with the absence of visible light as the devices and systems are developed with the potential of backing up power from fuel combustions.\n\nAs an edge, CSP are highly reliable in dispatching to grids when there is the need for whereas the system offers a very effective technology for Saudi Arabia, it also promises a cleaner, safer, more reliable, and even cheaper energy alternative.\n\nInterestingly, it has been reported that Saudi Arabia has indicated a strong political will towards the adaptation renewable energy and could lead exploding the sector within the Mid-East and North Africa [MENA] (DLR 9). This has been evident as there is an onward development of an energy plant by the government through SolFocus presently (DLR 32).\n\nThe kingdom has the desire of diversifying the economy and improving technology, which also explains why the need for a safer and indeed more economical friendly energy is a welcome alternative. However, (Iorfa 45) noted that the kingdom has not developed an adequate policy to maximize renewable energy, particularly CSP.\n\nChallenges of Developing CSP in Saudi Arabia Presently\n\nOne the most recurrent issue with Saudi Arabia’s potential to effectively maximize the usage of CSP has been consistently attributed to the lack of a committed framework- Iorfa (56) notes that there is a development to structure a framework to this effect, however.\n\nThe so desired framework would take care of technical issues such as taking care or at least controlling the highly dusty nature of the environment which is always caused by sand storms.\n\nThe region also has deficit of water sources which could be used for cooling systems.

During this period, CSP was by far the most continually efficient energy alternative and returned and equilibrium in quantity produced against the quantity of energy that is/would be consumed.\n\nThe general principle for the functionality of the CSP is the conversion of solar radiations to heat through the use of a receiving system with an efficiency of η Receiver . The heat is afterwards transformed to work which constitutes Carnot efficiency, η Carnot , and the solar radiations would provide a temperature of T H thereby causing a temperature of T° to be absorbed. By mathematical implication therefore:\n\nη = η Receiver * η Carnot\n\nη Carnot is given as 1 – T 0 / T H, and η Receiver = (Q absorbed – Q lost ) / Q solar.\n\nQ absorbed , Q solar, and Q lost are the fluxes which would be absorbed by the system, the incoming flux from the sun, and the flux which would be lost in the process. It is beyond the scope of this paper however to emphasize the scientific details involved with the process and it could therefore be assumed that losses in flux are based on radiation but further derivatives maybe produced by application of Boltzmann’s law.\n\nThe Cost involved with CSP installations in Saudi Arabia\n\nIn the year 2009, the cost for developing a CSP control unit with an output of a watt was quoted to be between two to four dollars; this excludes the energy source as it is always taped free from the sun.\n\nBased on these figures, generating a 250MW CSP work unit may cost between six hundred to a thousand million dollars [or between $0.12 to $0.18/ kwh] (TEEJ). With growing investor interest in CSP, such google, there is the tendency that in 2012, the cost for generating CSP electricity in Saudi Arabia, and indeed worldwide would reduce reasonably.\n\nFuture of CSP\n\nThe following projections have been made for energy utilization in Saudi Arabia from 2020 to 2050 as shown in Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11, Table 12 and Table 13.\n\nSAUDI ARABIA                            \n2007                              2008    2009  \nElectric power consumption (TWh)  174.8   186.5   199.1 \nIndex (%)                                 6.7%    6.8%  \nPeak Load (MW)                    34,953  38,000  41,200\nIndex (%)                                 8.7%    8.4%  \n\n\nTable 8.

Projections for energy utilization in Saudi Arabia from 2046 to 2050\n\nThese statistics are relevant as they express a growing demand for energy in the kingdom and suggest quantity of energy to be made available at various years up to the year 2050. Numerous studies have been conducted to ascertain the potentials of having a sustained CSP globally up to 2050 and results show that at least 25% of the energy used throughout the world by the year 2050 would be CSP.\n\nThis is similar to the valued presented in the tables above. Increased investment in the sector would be 92.50 billion euros as against the present 2.1 billion euros globally. Table 14 below show stipulated CSP growth as noted by Iorfa (12):\n\nTime  Annual                    Cumulative    \n      Investment                Capacity      \n2015  21 billion euros a year   420 megawatts \n2050  174 billion euros a year  1500 gigawatts\n\n\nTable 14. Stipulated global CSP growth from 2015 to 2015 (Iorfa 12).\n\nThe significance of these indications is an overwhelming reducing in the price of generating CSP electricity by the year 2050, as there is a continual increment of investor interest in the sector as well an advancing application of technology to the sector.\n\nAt the moment, the European Union is considering the development of the sector by committing $774.5 billion for the networking of CSP plants especially in NEMA and other regions around the Sahara for the facilitation of creation of ‘a new carbon-free network linking Europe, the Middle East and North Africa’ (Iorfa 14). This has been supported majorly by investors from Germany.\n\nAdvantages of CSP in Saudi Arabia\n\nSaudi Arabia, like any other country within the MENA region is endowed with an amazing amount of sunlight supply and make available the most friend CSP environments anywhere in the world as reflected in the instance of KA-Care (K.A.CARE VALUE CHAIN ASSESSMENT 12).\n\nEqually the availability of largely uncultivated lands makes locating of plants even more cost effective, and for the construction network of roads for transmitting grids would be easily achieved. The closeness of the kingdom to Europe is an added advantage for export of energy as Europe is in need of green energy and attaches at lot of value to the development of CSP.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian government must take more practical steps towards maximizing the adoptability of CSP against the highly challenging start up costs. Several factors have to be put together for the actualization of more friendly costs in the development of CSP projects within Saudi Arabia to include local incentives, concession of finances, as well as post-production green electricity export to UK and other European regions.\n\nBy and large, financial concession may not be very critical, and generating costs could be remarkably lows. By implication, there will be a corresponding need to enhance the level of investment which would bring about reduction in cost of CSP generation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper presents a report development and sustainability of Renewable Energy (RE) electricity as the optimal source for sustaining power demand in Saudi Arabia. It has noted that Concentrated Solar Energy (CSP) technology has a more effective potential for sustainability the kingdom’s electricity at the least cost.\n\nThe report also reflects on RE economics where the instance of KA-Care has been revised to examine the model for electric energy demand (and factors influencing the demand; such as efficiency gains and population), as well as the supply model (that has been developed to reflect the portfolio of the basic energy success).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nForsberg, Charles, Per Peterson, and Haihua Zhao. “High Temperature Liquied Fluoride Salt Closed Brayton Cycle Solar Power Towers.” Journal of Solar Energy Engineering 129 (2007): 141\n\nGerman Aerospace Center (DLR). “Concentrating Solar Power for the Mediterranean Region Final Report”.

Fact Sheet\n\nSolar Technologies\n\n 1. CSP technologies are based on the concept of concentrating solar radiation to be used for electricity generation with conventional power cycles using steam turbines, gas turbines or Stirling engines.\n 2. The main four CSP technologies are: parabolic trough systems, linear Fresnel systems, dish systems and power tower or central receiver system with distributed reflectors (heliostats).\n 3. CSP systems achieve average solar-to-electricity efficiencies of about 10-15 per cent.\n 4. CSP plants can work in hybrid operation, i.e. can be operated with fossil fuel as well as solar energy.\n 5. The CSP systems availability is about 90 per cent.\n 6. Individual CSP plants are now typically between 50 and 280 MW in size, but could still be larger.\n 7. The total CSP capacity whether in operation or under installation was 1,023 MW by mid of 2009.\n 8. Most of the projections assume advanced industry development, thus CSP could meet up to 7 per cent of the world’s projected power needs by 2030 and a full quarter by 2050.\n\nCommercial Viability Of Renewable Energy Projects\n\n 1. It is frequently assumed that, if any renewable technology reaches a cost of US$0.10 per KWh of electricity generated (assuming price of oil around US$70/barrel), it can be considered as being economically competitive or close to competitiveness.\n 2. Provided that resources and market conditions are favorable, the economically or near economically renewable energy technologies are small and large hydropower, onshore wind power, geothermal power and biomass power.\n 3. Solar PV and CSP technologies are expected to be economically competitive on the long term when cost reductions stemming from the continued R&D seeking higher productivity and efficiency as well as large-scale applications (economy of scale) are achieved.\n 4. For the ESCWA region, wind and solar technologies are considered the most promising as there are considerable potentials that would allow for large scale grid-connected electricity generation.\n 5. In general, EE measures are self financing with expected benefits to be forecasted in detailed energy audits.\n\nLarge-Scale Renewable Energy Projects In The Escwa Region\n\n 1. Egypt is the leader with a total capacity of 430 MW in wind energy in 2009.\n 2. Several countries have adopted ambitious goals to increase reliance on wind energy:\n     1. In Egypt, it is expected that 12 per cent of the total electric energy generated by the year 2020 will be from large-scale renewable energy projects.\n     2. Jordan’s plans include the establishment of wind farms with a capacity of 600 MW until 2020.\n 3. Additionally, it is expected that the envisaged Shams Ma’an PV project in Jordan would have an initial capacity of 100 MW, which can be expanded to 200 MW.\n     1. The United Arab Emirates is investing heavily and extensively in wind power in many Arab and foreign countries.\n     2. Saudi Arabia began the preparation of feasibility studies for the establishment of two wind farms, the first with capacity ranging from 20 to 40 MW, and the other with a capacity of 10 MW.\n     3. Yemen has a 60 MW wind farm in the development phase.\n     4. In addition to this, many countries, such as the Sudan and Syria, carry out resource assessment studies for wind energy as a prelude to setting goals commensurate with their potential. It is worth noting that preliminary assessments indicate that many ESCWA member countries possess potentials that would allow utilizing wind energy on a commercial scale.\n 4. Several ESCWA member countries engaged in solar energy projects:\n     1. Egypt started the construction of its first grid-connected large-scale CSP project Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) of 140 MW with 20 MW solar share, which is expected to be operative by late 2010.\n     2. Egypt intends to build two new CSP projects with 50 MW each, as well as a 20 MW large-scale gridconnected PV plant in south Egypt by the year 2017.\n     3. Kuwait has completed a technical feasibility study for the construction of a solar thermal power plant with a capacity of 280 MW, including 60 MW solar component.\n     4. In the United Arab Emirates, the Abu Dhabi Company for Future Energy, known as Masdar, has already connected a 10 MW PV plant to the grid, and expects the 100 MW Shams 1 CSP plant to be online by late 2011, and the Shams 2 plant by mid-2013.\n     5. Masdar is also studying the feasibility of the establishment of some plants to produce solar electricity and desalinated water from 500 MW solar plants in Arab countries or abroad.\n     6. Jordan is intending to build a 100 MW PV plant.\n     7. Yemen has launched rural electrification projects based on PV systems in cooperation with Germany. ESCWA is also finalizing the Ka’awa Village PV Electrification Project in Yemen.\n 5. In November 2007, the Gulf countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pledged a total of US$750 million to a new fund to tackle global warming through research for a clean environment.\n     1. Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates pledged US$150 million each for the fund.\n     2. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, will invest US$300 million in the fund.",
      "Supply Chain Management at Dell Computers Essay\n\nAccording to Klapper et al, supply chain management is the integrated set of functions that seek to ensure that the products of an organization reach a customer in a timely manner. Therefore, the roles of the supply chain manager at Dell computers are to ensure that the customer is satisfied with the product distribution utilized by the company.\n\nThe main roles of a supply chain manager are to ensure the effective selection and management of suppliers and to supervise efficient transportation of products from the production location through storage, though storage, and finally to the consumer (Chomilier, Samii, and Wassenhove).\n\nTherefore, at Dell, the responsibilities of the supply chain manager are to ensure that there is effective communication between the customer, the supplier, and manufacturer of the final product.\n\nThis role leads to a high demand for supply chain managers by firms such as Dell because the supply chain managers ensure that the company’s products are efficiently distributed to various consumers in the market (Kale, 2004). These managers are also in high demand because the company has to distribute its products to diverse populations, and to do this, effective communication in the supply chain is needed.\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\nStrengths                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Weaknesses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n  * From the Case Study onDell Computers, it is evident that the company is the largest computer maker in the world, so marketing the computers is simplified because they have a set brand name.                                                * The main weakness with the marketing potential of Dell computers is that they have a weak relationship with retailers since the company prefers marketing its own products. This means that the company does not penetrate the market effectively, and the retailers do not market the company products.\n  * Another strength from the customer’s perspective is the use of custom designs to make computers; some customers will order custom-made computers from the company thus increasing their brand loyalty.                                       * The other marketing weakness of the company is the fact that they do not have unique technologies to offer the market, so new products do not increase the market potential of the company.                                                                                                             \n  * The shipment strategy used by the company is an effective method that ensures that the computers reach the customer with minimal delays, which increases the marketing potential of the company.                                             * The issue of dealing with a large amount of suppliers from different countries means that the company faces many potential problems when their products are recalled from the market (Cohen and Rousell, 2004).                                                                                         \nOpportunities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Threats                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n  * The main opportunity that the company has in the market is the opportunity to improve on the brand created by the founder; it presents a chance for the company to expand its market capabilities to regions outside the current domains.    * The main threat to the marketing potential of Dell computers is the increasing number of popular brand names in the market, which increases the competitive factor and reduces market share.                                                                                                            \n  * The other marketing opportunity come from the projected expansion to new markets like China and India, which are projected in the situation analysis to grow in the next three to five years (Clay, 2006).                                   * Since Dell is a company that is focused on international business, fluctuations in world currencies can affect the profit potential and marketing capabilities of the company.                                                                                                                          \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Developing strong relations between retailers and competing companies that reduce the distribution capability of the company, also affect the marketing potential of the company.                                                                                                                       \n\n\nReferences\n\nCase Study: Dell.

      "Management of change at Procter and Gamble Case Study\n\nA descriptive case study of Procter and Gamble\n\nA brief background of Procter and Gamble\n\nThe current staffing issues facing the accounts department at Procter and Gamble are very relevant in determining the strategies, structures and practices to be assumed in order to achieve and manage change in order to meet organizational objectives. The efforts towards ensuring that an organization is cognizant of staff issues is a major step in determining the ability and levels of successes that will be realized via seeking the best strategies of addressing the issues pro-actively.\n\nBeing a worker at Procter and Gamble, I noticed a major management problem in the area of staffing since the staff working in the accounts payable department did not have adequate knowledge of the work they were to carry out.\n\nThis problem gave rise to accumulation of work load, high stress levels, dissatisfactions and eventual quitting of work by managers in the department as well as some staff. In my view, organizations should regularly review and harmonize their management strategies with organization learning and communication to cohere with the highly dynamic business systems.\n\nProcter and Gamble is a leading American multinational company that manufactures and sales wide range of goods to its consumers in over 180 countries. Its channels of primary sales are drug stores, membership club stores, grocery stores, and mass merchandisers. It has several business segments some which include family care segment whose brands are pampers, Charmin, and bounty.\n\nThe products from this segment include paper towels, facial tissues, diapers and bath tissues. Other segments include homecare, snacks and pet care, healthcare, grooming and beauty segments. The latter manufactures products that include skin care products, prestige fragrances, personal cleansing, hair care, deodorants and cosmetic products.\n\nIn the period between years 2000 to 2007, Procter and Gamble’s organic sales growth was marked at 6% with a growth of 13.9% in its earnings. Its growth in terms of sales has massively grown, a consideration that is reflected by its sale of $ 82.6 in 2011. Procter and Gamble has been able to establish its competitive edge via differentiation of its offerings. It leadership has devoted finances and time to research and development with an aim of creating new products needed by consumers.\n\nIn addition to research and development, the company has invested heavily in enhancing relationship with retailers and learning consumer behaviours. This has been effective in helping it understand the needs of consumers and improve its products. As a company, it is decentralized with each segment focused on the country it is situated. While these strategies reduce overhead costs, its local and global scale focus have been some of the key pillars in gaining competitive advantage.\n\nProcter and Gamble staffing and change management\n\nChange management is the most important tool for modern organizations’ demand to increase productivity and profitability. It acts as the link between the organization and its future by deriving the necessary visionary demands for progress. Besides, it forms the main platform upon which all aspects of revitalizing productivity are established.\n\nThe ability of Procter and Gamble to profitably operate is based on its overall capacity to harmonize its strategic operations in a manner that coheres with its inherent culture.\n\nFollowing the high demand for the products and the insatiable quest for more profits by consumers and shareholders, many employees working in the accounts payable department were recruited and established hurriedly and therefore the management overlooked the general proficiency requirements. Since this department requires processing and maintenance of account payable transactions, it became impossible for the current staff to manage the work.\n\nThe problem of staffing where I work was not a major problem immediately after the establishment of the company until in the last few years when the efficiencies of the accounts payable department started to decline. The problem was attributed to the fact that the members of staff operating in this department were not well conversant with data entry, computer applications and general accounting practices as well as accounts payables.\n\nMost of them could not handle the jobs given to them and therefore could not meet work expectations. This problem eventually led to the others such as dissatisfaction with work, excessive work loads and high stress levels. The problem which was initially thought to be minor escalated into a major management issue.\n\nOne of the observations I made from the situation was the negative effect of the problem reflected in reduction in morale of the workers, a notion that has threatened the whole company with stagnation due to lack of commitment, innovation, and creativity necessary to ensure the highest possible quality of work in the department.\n\nEmerging difficulties –organization staffing and management problems\n\nLack of training/ organization learning\n\nTraining acts as the best platform for acquisition of new skills. The latter is dependent on factors that directly affect personal change at all levels. The problem facing Procter and Gamble’s department of accounts payable is that it failed to provide an opportunity where its staff would be able to understand their deficits and therefore move with vitality to address them.\n\nThe lack of training for workers in this department indicates absence of emphasis that an effective person must be able to relate institutional requirements or objectives with organizational demands. This viewpoint is of great importance in the industry as skills require specified application on a market that is highly dynamic.\n\nAs a worker in my department, institutional training enabled me to figure out how to perform my tasks effectively and conduct real-time simulations. Since most workers at Procter and Gamble were suffering from stress, I understood well enough the need to comprehend the market dynamics.\n\nMost workers in the accounts payable department at Procter and Gamble have great expectations, but they fail to maximize on their input in raising value due to inadequate skills. Though it is largely the role of the management of Procter and Gamble to motivate its employees, important skills in processing and maintenance of account payable transactions are very crucial in order to enhance performance and reduce work loads.\n\nResistance to change due to recalcitrant leaders\n\nAnother difficulty that I observed in the department I work in is resistance to change among leaders. The act of streamlining the accounts process is a new concept and the management at Proctor and Gamble is not used to it. The calls for such changes culminate to major misinterpretation, misunderstanding, and misrepresentation of the concept at the lower levels of the organization’s operations.\n\nBesides, the organization’s staff appeared to have assimilated internal subcultures that often further deliberate major issues that affect them especially when they are being addressed by the management. Notably, the internal subcultures of the organization appear to be strong since there seems to be robust resistance towards implementing change.\n\nCommunication\n\nIt is my view that all aspects of an effective change process can only be articulated in the presence of good communication at all levels of the process. As indicated earlier, one of the major barriers that Procter and Gamble accounts payable department staff and the company management lack is effective communication. Communication has a great potential of undoing any barrier. Effective communication is a holistic inculcation of the necessary identity with current issues facing an organization.\n\nThe major difficulty that has been in this company where I am working is lack of communication between leaders and subordinate staff. The change group and the management of Procter and Gamble does not engage in direct communication with staff at all times since any slight process of change takes long time before it is accomplished.\n\nIndeed, I appreciate the expected difficulties that may be encountered while employees are working in account payable department. However, lack of communication among leaders at Procter and Gamble and the concerned department is a major issue.\n\nAreas that needed change and application of Morgan’s mental model\n\nOrganizational change has become an important aspect in management of businesses since it provides an organization with opportunities to enhance its overall performance. As such, theorists have developed models which have been of utmost importance in providing the way forward in accomplishing change. One such theorist is Gareth Morgan who developed the mental model. This model is very crucial in determining areas which Proctor and Gamble should change.\n\nOrganizations as machines\n\nMorgan uses the metaphor organizations as machines to reflect how management should think of an organization to derive change. The leadership at Proctor and Gamble needs to ensure that its staff at the accounts payable department acquires efficiency of high levels just like machines. It needs an effective staff that will work with a machine-like efficiency. This will be attained by adding value to employees and especially the accounts payable department.\n\nNotably, the vision of the company had remained vague for a long time with its values being equally ancient and perhaps inapplicable or undesirable by the staff and consumers. Its managers have relied on the fundamental metaphor and ignored the idea that the staff in the affected department needs to be machine-like to enhance profitability.\n\nAn organization as brains\n\nThe brain of an organization in implementing change is critical in creating networks. The problem facing Proctor and Gamble can be eradicated when the model of employing the aspect of brain is applied in the affected sector. Its leadership should cultivate knowledge, requisite variety, feedback, intelligence, mindsets, distributed control and learning as strategies in curbing the work overload, stress among workers and lack of skills.\n\nThe capacity to grow at Procter and Gamble is based on its ability to bring into play organizational learning to enhance the brain of its staff and inculcate best staffing systems for sustainability and success.\n\nAn organization as an organism\n\nA business organization is similar to an organism. Therefore, it needs to change, evolve and survive in order to gain a competitive edge. It is through viewing Proctor and Gamble as an organism that the problem of management and staff’s capacity to deliver in the accounts payable department will be addressed. This will provide a platform for understanding that the business is an organism that can be born, grown, faced challenges and eventually die.\n\nProctor and Gable must have organism-like and machine-like characteristics, understand its staffs’ weaknesses and strengths and make improvement through training. As indicated in the case study, a new initiative can be established when the performance is poor and the organization which is on a negative progress to aid in restoring it back to the profitability tract. New initiatives can also be assimilated when an organization is stalling and require re-energizing for better development\n\nAn organization as a political system\n\nAn organization’s system brings out the necessary cohesion among departments and also culminates into better performance quality. Procter and Gamble should introduce an effective leadership structure that is internally oriented to ensure that it puts across the emphasis of staff learning.\n\nAs indicated earlier, there is need to ensure that the accounts payable department’s performance remains ahead of others as a mode of keeping the department effective. Organization learning should also be attached to innovation with the rewards being very high.\n\nAn organization as culture\n\nSuccess in an organization has been cited as a factor that is determined by the culture whereby management and staff’s demonstrate the ability to work together in a harmonic mode. Notably, it is this coterminous harmony that emphasizes the need for learning to develop skills, quality and customer value.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary for Procter and Gamble to establish an organization’s guiding values and principles since they help in adding quality and defining an organization especially in terms of organizational learning. There is need for the management at Procter and Gamble to appreciate that lack of skills in account payable tasks is perhaps the main cause of its downward trend. The aforementioned features will form the most important culture of the organization.\n\nOrganization as flux and transformation\n\nA constant change is crucial for Proctor and Gamble to experience the much needed change. It came out clearly that this organisation was peculiar in the sense that it relied on the ability of the staff and employees to handle the functions of the account payable department. The staff should be held fully responsible for all the transactions between the business and the consumers of its services.\n\nMost importantly, organizational transformation through staff learning and limited complexities will dictate the need for team work in all the operations as a major facet of improvement and seeking alternative as well as most effective systems that would guarantee the highest returns.\n\nThe management of Procter and Gamble should make the staff understand that the department is a single unit and that only cooperation and learning between the staff and all the departments would assist them in achieving the required results.\n\nThrough team work, it becomes possible for all the staff and employees to part of the engine that drive the business towards profitability. Arguably, it is through flux and transformation that members of the staff and other employees will be able to derive identity after understanding that their contribution is being appreciated.\n\nSome of the areas that were changed\n\nThe problem facing the account payable department at Procter and Gamble has been a major source of concern that has created the need for change. One such change has been through encouraging works in the department to become change agents. It is in this respect that continuous improvement among employees has become an integral part of the change process. The staffs in the department have been allocated the role of instilling continuous change in the process and in the bank too.\n\nBesides, they alongside the management team will seek to identify any creativity and innovative consideration by the members of the change team and the organization as a whole. It is worth noting that plans have been set up to ensure this team undergoes special training to ensure that they develop the necessary skills for the hard task.\n\nBesides, together with the management, they will seek to ensure that the business remains sensitive to the needs for better customer value, staff motivation, and better communication between the company’s staff and the management.\n\nMain learning points\n\nOne of the key learning points from the study is that a desirable change in a company is linked to the approach a management adopts towards addressing the different cases of employees’ problems. There is need for the management to change its attitude towards the employees from a mechanistic point of view to increase their performance.\n\nBesides, it is also desirable that a link between accounts payable department and the management is achieved to reduce such a problem recurrence in future. The law requirements should also be followed to avoid conflict with the legal system which paints a bad image of the company at the market.\n\nCommunication is a core aspect that can enhance better harmony between the team being involved in account payable duties, other staff, middle level management, and the top management in Procter and Gamble. Taking into consideration that Procter and Gamble is organized in a hierarchical mode, effective communication will be a better platform for assessing the change progress and indeed contribute to it.\n\nHowever, the lack of it has made it impossible for it to ensure that all its leaders and staff offer least resistance which could result from ignorance. With communication, it will be easy to bring the management at the local level where the people assimilate the management roles via contribution to the overall decisions made.\n\nContinuous change is a cumulative system that demands inclusive and continuous analysis of progress as exemplified by the returns in productivity as well as the staff orientation and assimilation of the new approaches. Therefore, a system should involve surveys especially of the short term win-win situations for all new procedures and methods being followed to reduce the time taken, workloads, stress and dissatisfactions.\n\nBesides, there should be evaluations on the basis of the staff’s ability to change and assimilate new systems to welcome more change for improvement as opposed to spontaneous changes. To ensure long term benefits, the system should establish systematic reporting systems for the change team, staff and management to assess the rate of progress.\n\nReferences\n\nAhenkora, K. & Peasah O 2011, ‘Crafting strategy that measures up’, International Journal of Business and Management vol.6 no. 10, pp. 278-283.\n\nHopkins, M 2009, ‘8 Reasons Sustainability Will Change Management (That You Never Thought of)’, MIT Sloan Management Review vol. 51 no. 1, pp. 27-30.\n\nJanicijevic, N 2010, ‘Business processes in organizational diagnosis’, Management : Journal of Contemporary Management Issues vol. 15 no. 2, pp. 85-106.\n\nJohnson, L 2002, ‘Issue selling in the organization,’ MIT Sloan Management Review vol. 43 no. 3, pp. 8-9.\n\nLeavy, B 2010,’Design thinking – a new mental model of value innovation’, Strategy & Leadership , vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 5-14.\n\nMarkle, GL 2011, ‘Constructions of citizenship among multinational corporations’, International Journal of Business and Social Science: Special Issue, vol. 2 no. 24, pp. 283-293.\n\nPalmer, I., Dunford, R.& Akin, G 2009, Managing organizational change a multiple perspective approach , McGraw Hill, Boston.\n\nSchumann, P. 2001.

      "Project Marketing to Improve Project Success Thesis\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper aims to provide a better understanding of project marketing and to contribute to the literature the perceived relationship between project marketing and project management.\n\nA research question can be asked to get a closer look at the entire dissertation, that is: how can project marketing be used to attain project success? We have also to answer the question related to this one, which goes: Is project marketing the same or a sub-category of project management?\n\nIn the age of intense globalisation, organisations are continuously experiencing phenomenal changes and innovations. The world of business is constantly facing new challenges, innovations and applications, thus organisations have to cope with constant change. Managing change is one of the priorities of the new global organisation because change is an opportunity for improvement.\n\nOrganisations have to adopt and continuously train and improve because of these changes. Adoption and improvement are significant here because outsourcing companies (or those who provide outsourcing services) are a source of competition. This means there is a strong competition when it comes to talents and capabilities and output.\n\nGlobalisation involves systems, technology and processes. Technology is a part and tool of globalisation which has affected even the smallest community.\n\nGlobal business has penetrated the remotest areas of the countryside. Small organisations have become global organisations, or they operate in a global scale. With the advent of information technology, organisations have to introduce various changes in their business processes, marketing strategies, product orientation, employee management or human resource management, and other organisational strategies in order to be competitive.\n\nProject management is as old as written history. Tracing back history, we can analyze its role and importance to man’s activities. From the time of management scientists and industrial engineers like Elton Mayo and Frederick Winslow Taylor to Henry Ford’s production-line manufacturing famous with Model T automobile, to Henry Gantt and his famous charts, we see project management present in every aspect of labour and production. This was further enhanced with the emergence of mainframe digital computers which made processing and updating of products faster and easier. (Lock, 2007, p. 3)\n\nMan-made projects are not new: monuments surviving from the earliest civilisations testify to the incredible achievements of our ancestors. Modern projects, for all their technological sophistication, are not necessarily greater in scale than some of those early large projects.\n\nFormal management organisation structures have existed from early times. But history can also tell us of the many projects that failed. The Standish Group says that failure is an effect of innovation and innovation is one of the factors for success. ( Chaos: a recipe for success , 1999, p. 1)\n\nProductions and operations are linked to operations management (OM) and is the process by which goods and services are created (Shim & Siegel, 1999, p. 2). This can be productive processes in all kinds of organised activities such as factories, offices, supermarkets, and hospitals. Management decisions are based on customer requirements, and decisions can be done in the course of operational processes.\n\nProject management is now a major area of concentration in organisations; successful managers know what project management is all about. Project managers occupy a unique position within firms because they supervise special and regular projects or activities of the organisation. The key to the success of a project is the understanding of the particular project, coupled with teamwork and close coordination with the project management team, along the lines of organisational systems and framework.\n\nLooking at the various projects and activities of organisations, we find project management to be interesting and something worthy to carry along as we pursue future endeavours and careers. Not only is the topic fruitful and important to project managers but to any member of an organisation or to anyone involved in a profession that involves diversity and a lot of projects and activities. Understanding the concept and methods of project management enables us to be a part of the success of any project.\n\nIn the 1970s, there was a rapid growth in information technology, or IT. Industrial project management continued as before, but with more project management software available and wider recognition of the role. However, the spread of IT brought another different kind of project manager on the scene.\n\nThese were the IT project managers: people who had no project planning or scheduling experience and no interest or desire to learn those methods. They possessed instead the technical and mental skills needed to lead teams developing IT projects. These IT project managers were usually senior systems analysts, and this profession is fast growing. (Lock, 2007, p. 3)\n\nSuccessful outcome of projects requires some investment on the part of the organisation; thus it is obligatory on the part of the managers to see to it that the project is well planned and executed. This is how important project management is to an organisation or a group implementing certain projects.\n\nThe major aim of this paper is to determine how organisations apply project marketing in relation to project management. Project marketing is seen as a primary organisational activity in large projects. Organisations see this in the context of organisational activity and not just an ordinary function. Project management is practiced by organisations as a regular part of organisational activities.\n\nProject management involves managing a certain activity, and this can be about a project at work, at school, or at home. The term project management can be anything, or can even be a case study, but in this paper, we deal with large scale projects of organisations.\n\nProject management is about processes and how to be able to successfully carry out a task up to the end of its schedule set up by the project manager as required by the customer. Practically, no organisation operates without a project or activity, and this project has to be managed by a well-trained manager, who knows how to act in situations that require immediate and precise decisions.\n\nThis essay deals with some guidelines for the project manager, and other relevant aspects of project management. It also touches on project management as applied to Information Technology, and other studies made by authors and experts in the field of project management. Project marketing applied to project management is another important part of this paper. This is drawing up case studies that may be of help to the understanding of the related subjects.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nIn examining the historical evolution of organisations, we are faced with interesting trends. First, organisational forms emerged in waves, and second, once these forms were established, others remained applicable to the present situation and stay there for a considerable length of time while others evolve and change into some form. (Aldrich, 2008, p. 177)\n\nThe situation in this second trend is that the environment is changing giving advantage to some organisational forms at particular times. These organisations established during a particular period have technologies and structures available during that time. Organisational forms are dependent on the resources and technology available in a given situation.\n\nOther factors include the state’s resources and role, the development of the economy, the political development, technological advancement, and similar other forces. Emergence of organisational forms also depends on three factors: 1.) technological advancement with a corresponding social structural support; 2.) power and wealth available in a given situation; and 3.) the development of labour markets. (Aldrich, 2008, p. 177)\n\nLarge incumbent firms are not really keen on adapting innovations because of their organisational structure. Burns and Stalker (1961 cited in Swann and Gill, 1993, p. 15) mentioned two forms of organisations: the organic and the mechanistic organisations.\n\nMechanistic firms had a well-defined organisational structure and could easily adapt to stable and predictable market forces for which they could easily take hold of. The organic form, on the other hand, adapts to rapidly changing conditions specifically when problems and requirements could not be easily met. Old organisations cannot easily adapt to rapidly changing conditions and thus cannot enforce innovations.\n\nProject marketing and project management\n\nProject marketing and project management must go together. Project management has been in existence since 4500 years ago when the great pyramid of Egypt was constructed as one of the earliest of projects. This means that the application of project management from that time on has not changed dramatically.\n\nA research group known as the International Network for Project Marketing and System Selling (INPM) defines the term project marketing as related to purchasing and selling in organisations. This means the term refers to external marketing. INPM researchers have not focused on the internal marketing of projects within the organisation.\n\nInstead, projects classified as multi-organisational and international fall under the heading contract operations. This is opposed to operations based on exports and considered foreign direct investment. (Skaates & Tikkanen, 2002, p. 504)\n\nAccording to Soudain, Deshayes, and Tikkanen (2009), the INPM argument on project marketing states that it is not enough to consider a project between one firm or a group of firms to another firm or group of organisations as a mere project management. Instead, the whole process should be considered as a multi-firm project network served by individual firms. Moreover, there are two levels of relationship management in the context of project management.\n\nFirst, there is the management of relationships and networks considered for the individual projects from start to completion. Then, there is also the company level for the project which encompasses relationships between organisations for some time in their multiple project cooperation ‘in a broader economic, social, and political business network (or milieu)’ (Tikkanen as cited in Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al., 2009, p. 36).\n\nProject operations have sub-classifications, like: partial projects, turnkey projects and the last one which is turnkey plus projects. Partial projects may refer to partial system deliveries. A turnkey project refers to the delivery of a complete system. Turnkey plus projects refer to a complete system delivery plus additional services, in the form of personnel training or facilities management, are given. (Skaates & Tikkanen, 2002, p. 504)\n\nA market project refers to ‘a transaction concerning a functioning whole’ which is intended for a buyer (Holstius as cited in Skaates & Tikkanen, 2002, p. 504). The transaction involves ‘a discrete package of products, services and other actions designed to create (capital) assets for the buyer for a certain period of time.’ (p. 504)\n\nResearchers of the marketing groups IMP and INPM emphasise the role of relationships in business-to-business marketing, and as such a conceptual framework was created which provided comparison on special characteristics in project marketing and systems selling with characteristics found in business-to-business marketing situations.\n\nThe framework D-U-C was created with three distinguishing features of project provided, such as:\n\n‘D, which stands for discontinuity of demand for projects\n\n‘U, which stands for uniqueness of each project in the aspects of technical, financial and socio-political\n\n‘C, which stands for complexity of every individual project when referring to the number of actors involved in the supply process.’ (Skaates & Tikkanen, 2002, p. 504)\n\nAccording to this framework, discontinuity on relationships may be the result of lack of bonding, long-term mutual relationship or orientation beyond the project, although there is a substantial relationship interaction during the initial stages of the project.\n\nIn some cases, after the completion of the project, a so-called ‘sleeping relationship’ phase may occur. Firms have to use every possible way in order to have a post-project interaction with previous clients, thereby minimising the sleeping relationship scenario. (Cova & Salle as cited in Skaates & Tikkanen, 2002, p. 504)\n\nIn project marketing, the demand-related discontinuity, or the D in the D-U-C framework, is a major strategic problem. INPM studies have focused on discontinuity in multiple projects. Each individual project is regarded as distinct episode in the buyer-supplier relationship. The success or failure of individual projects will determine future buyer-seller relationships. Therefore, it is important that project marketers should focus on the success of single projects and develop significant relationships where individual projects are based. (Skaates & Tikkanen, 2002, p. 505)\n\nThe idea of milieu is an important aspect in the subject of marketing research. It has been described as a “sociospatial configuration” which has four elements: a territory; a network of actors brought together for a common cause within the territory; a representation by the actors; and the law related to the milieu which can be a set of rules and norms (Cova et al. as cited in Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al., 2009, p. 37). The business network concept can be used interchangeably with the milieu concept (Skaates & Tikkanen as cited in Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al.).\n\nDefinitions\n\nThere are several definitions of project marketing that will be discussed in this section. A simple definition is that project marketing refers to business-to-business, or industrial, marketing transactions. A project, on the other hand, is an activity that aims to create a distinct product or service (Pinto as cited in Maurer, 2011, p. 143).\n\nThe American Marketing Association’s definition of marketing states that it is a ‘process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual organizational goals’ (Boyett & Boyett, 2003, p. 2).\n\nMarketing involves satisfactory exchanges through effective communication with customers and building relationships with them and with other stakeholders who could greatly affect organisational performance. (Boyett & Boyett, 2003, p. 3)\n\nThe definitions and common applications of project marketing and project portfolio management seem to overlap. The International Organization for Standardization defines a project as ‘a unique set of processes consisting of coordinated and controlled activities’ with beginning and end dates, and done with specific objectives. The project objective has some requirements to be delivered, applied with constraints like time, cost and resources.\n\nProject management, on the other hand, refers to ‘the application of methods, tools, techniques and competencies to a project’. Project management is applied with processes and has several phases of the project life cycle. (“Guidance on project management,” 2011, p. 8)\n\nThe deliverables in a project life cycle are specified in accordance with the requirements set forth by the sponsor, customer and other stakeholders. (“Guidance on project management,” 2011, p. 9)\n\nMoreover, project marketing emphasises the different marketing activities occurring before obtaining a contract. The contracts involved are large projects, like building construction and power stations. (Laurence & Patel, 2009, p. 50)\n\nProject marketing involves a wide scope in the field of project management with project marketing re-defining the project in the wider field of project business. Project managers define project management as a process and project marketing as a task in project management. The project manager is responsible for project marketing.\n\nProject management has to work closely with project owners to identify and define opportunities and focus on the risks involved in the projects within the customer’s business. Project marketing refers to development but is practiced occasionally, a reason why researchers face countless challenges in relating this with real life situations. (Laurence & Patel, 2009, p. 50)\n\nTheoretical Framework\n\nThere are two schools of thought in the understanding of project marketing. First is the concept of project marketing by project marketing researchers. Generally, we understand marketing as the promotion and selling of whatever products and services companies can offer. (Laurence & Patel, 2009, p. 51)\n\nThe first school of thought advocates the four-phase process in project marketing. These are: the pre-project marketing (project is not yet in existence, but the supplier identifies targets and opportunities, and informs the client); the start of the project (rules are set, supplier-client relationship is enhanced); ongoing project marketing (stakeholders proceed with the necessary activities, re-negotiation and follow-up up to the end of the project); relationship is further enhanced; marketing setting grounds for future projects (“sleeping relationship” is avoided), and preparing for future projects. (Laurence & Patel, 2009, p. 53)\n\nThe second school of thought in the understanding of project marketing is the definition of project marketing by project managers. This framework recognises project management as a social construction process. (Laurence & Patel, 2009, p. 53)\n\nPhilip Kotler (as cited in Laurence & Patel, 2009, p. 51) emphasises ‘the needs and wants’ of customers in the definition of marketing; while the Chartered Institute of Marketing focuses on ‘identifying, anticipating and satisfying’ the customers. (Kotler & Lane as cited in Laurence & Patel, 2009, p. 51) According to Boyett and Boyett (2003), Philip Kotler’s definition of marketing excludes selling. Kotler is a professor of International Marketing and author of 15 books on marketing.\n\nKotler argues that marketing and selling are not the same. Selling can be part of marketing but there are other activities in marketing. Peter Drucker added that the making of ‘selling superfluous’ is one of the aims of marketing. The reason behind could be that when marketing is very successful, you require only little selling. (Boyett & Boyett, 2003, p. 4)\n\nThe marketing concept states that an organisation should provide products that satisfy customers’ needs through organisational activities that also help the organisation to achieve its goals. (Jobber & Lancaster, 2003, p. 11)\n\nCustomer satisfaction is a major aim of the marketing concept. A firm has to find out what will satisfy customers. The organisation must continue to alter, adapt and develop products to keep pace with customers’ changing desires and preferences. The marketing concept stresses the importance of customers and emphasises that marketing activities begin and end with them. (Jobber and Lancaster, 2003, p. 15)\n\nAs Pinto and Colvin (as cited in Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 215) said, project marketing in project management should have the right mix and the right market, or that the successful marketing has the right product, the right price at the right time, with an appropriate promotion, and in which the rightness of the elements is decided by the customer.\n\nA marketing strategy can be likened to a recipe. The marketing functions can be referred to as the ingredients, and recipes vary according to the dish we want. Strategies would require different ingredients in the menu we desire. Success depends on the ingredients we apply. (Jobber & Lancaster, 2003, p. 14)\n\nBut marketing is not just providing products and services. It is also about delivering changing benefits to the customer’s changing needs. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as a set of activities and processes that focus on the delivery of products for the benefit and value of customers and clients, including all the stakeholders in the interconnected activities in business.\n\nProject marketing researchers define project marketing as an activity that deals with the selling and marketing issues of projects. Project therefore is defined in the context of the marketing perspective; meaning, project involves a transaction about a package of products that aim to create capital assets to benefit the buyer over a certain period of time (Cova & Salle as cited in Laurence & Patel, 2009, p. 51).\n\nAccording to these researchers, project concept should include the activities done before the start of the project to post-project phase. On the other hand, Maurer (2011) defines project marketing within the category of business-to-business marketing, which also includes industrial marketing.\n\nThe aim of project marketing is to integrate marketing to the activity of a project, and in business-to-business transactions, should take place at the very beginning, i.e. when the project has not been started yet (Lecoeuvre-Soudain & Deshayes, 2006, p. 103).\n\nProject marketing identifies four phases in the project course: before the start of the project, an “upstream of the project” activity, during the course of the project, and “after the project” phase. Together these phases bring into play six variables, which are: collaboration, relationship, joining, training, trust, and communication (Lecoeuvre-Soudain & Deshayes as cited in Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al., 2009, p. 40)\n\nThe “pre-project” phase is the time where the marketing process commenced, i.e. to involve the partners in the managerial partnership, which leads to reorganisation and the formation of a managerial team to be led by a project manager. Other activities on this aspect include the implementation of a partnership and the piloting of the project.\n\nIn the study of Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al. (2009) over two companies, this phase required great vigilance, and general directions of the two firms when the project was implemented in other countries. (Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al. 2009, p. 40)\n\nThe “start of the project” phase focuses on the evaluation of the reliability or competences of the two firms’ resources on the context of management. It is also in this phase where specification and conditions for an invitation to tender are co-written by both sides. Future aspects of project management are also discussed and agreed upon in this phase. People involved in management and those in marketing cooperate and negotiate but they remain separate and distinct.\n\nFor example, in Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al.’s study, project marketing actors were from Company X, while actors tasked for managerial dimension came from Company Y. Company X conduct of relation marketing led to a cooperation for the writing and subsequent agreement of the conditions of purchase and the future agreement to tender. The managerial aspect is very precise in this phase. Actions of coconstruction and codevelopment among actors form in this phase.\n\nThe relation between the two companies is present although in a different way, i.e. around the same idea (or aim of the project). This is the transition from a mere idea to a concrete realisation of the project. The project is agreed and signed, leading the way for the “during the project” phase. The milieu now is being concretized or realized (the territory, the network, the representation, and the rules. (Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al., 2009, p. 41)\n\n“During the project” phase begins with the installation of a project team. The project manager is tasked to: control the project, manage and conduct managerial reporting to the head office and to the customer or client, and conduct relational marketing with the other actors constituting the project team and other trade partners, the company staff and the customer.\n\nAnother part of this phase is the centering of the project team to improve the role of management and marketing. Finally, this is taking control in the context of management and of marketing from the beginning up to the realization and the start of the sale of the project. (Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al., 2009, p. 41)\n\n“After the project” phase is the conduct of the management and relational marketing for the conclusion of the project, and dissolution of the teams. The project is being assessed of its success. Other activities include future offers of projects and “solution selling”. (Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al., 2009, p. 41)\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\n\nThe subject on customer relationship management (CRM) is about maintaining positive relationships with customers, focusing on customer loyalty, and adding value to the relationship. (King & Burgess, 2007, p. 421)\n\nCRM is about marketing and an analysis of customer behaviour (Kotler as cited in King & Burgess, 2007, p. 422). Chaffey (as cited in King & Burgess) suggests a three-stage model of CRM in managing customer relationships. First, customers can be acquired through a clear communication in a value proposition.\n\nCustomer loyalty can be attained by way of good service (which means quality service), and the relationship can last for a long time if the products or services are delivered according to customer requirements. CRM uses information and communications technology to acquire data, creating a personal interaction with the customer (Swift; Brohman et al.; Pan & Lee as cited in King & Burgess, 2007, p. 422).\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) became popular in the 1960s with the introduction of a computer software. Production systems were integrated with the other internal functions, like purchasing, human resource, financial, and so on. ERP uses a database linking the various tasks and inputs from different departments.\n\nIt can be configured to make the departmental functions simplified. The departments have to be adopted and reengineered. Information is shared as transactions accompanied by voluminous data and information are integrated into the system. The role and functions attributable to ERP are vast and the areas covered encompass tasks in planning, accounting, financing, human resource, the many aspects of management and human resource management. (Ash & Burn, 2002, p. 33)\n\nCRM and ERP make use of information from a database. Information is important in organisations because without it, it is nearly impossible to arrive at well-informed decisions. Risk is a part of business decisions, but good information can help minimise risk and uncertainty in business. (McKee, Cox, Housden, & Parkinson, 2009, p. 3)\n\nCRM and ERP both involve large-scale technologies. An effective CRM provides valuable information that will enable the organisation to analyse customer behaviour and preferences. CRM needs technology to be effective. Bose (as cited in King & Burgess, 2007) defined CRM as an ‘integration of technologies and business processes’ to gain customer satisfaction (p. 422).\n\nCRM and ERP are somewhat similar. The difference is that ERP is focused on back-office staff while CRM is used for sales and marketing, which is known as the front-line staff. ERP is for supply and demand while CRM’s aim is to gain insight about the customers.\n\nBecause of the introduction of information systems in organisations, different functions and roles have to be reorganised. New paradigm shifts also emerged. Out of this, business analysis has to be defined to link the traditional and the ‘new age’ system. Without business analysis, managements and employees in organisations would not know how to work effectively and use the different technological tools that have been introduced.\n\nThe field of IT involves hardware and software. Hardware refers to computers, laptops and servers, and other related equipment, while software refers to operating systems and other applications for various functions. A combination of hardware and software is called IT infrastructure. This infrastructure needs a support staff or people to man the equipment and operate the different functions. The support staff is called the IT support organisation which is responsible for implementing, operating and supporting IT.\n\nAn organisation’s IT infrastructure is supported and operated by employees and procedures that will build and operate the IT. These systems allow the firm to meet its primary objectives, such as acquiring profits, minimising unnecessary costs, improving functions, enhancing customer loyalty, and fast tracking supply chain. (Reynolds, 2010, p. 17)\n\nERP is about internal management; it uses technology to integrate and simplify the different departmental functions. It is an information technology used for processing and effective communication. (Nah, Zuckweiler, & Lau, 2003, p. 5) Through ERP, data can be shared from a common database, enhancing internal problem solution technique. (Reynolds, 2010, p. 22)\n\nCRM focuses on customer interaction, on knowing what customers need and want so the firm can provide appropriate products and services. ERP focuses on routine internal processes. CRM has more challenges, and one of these is to introduce culture change.\n\nCRM involves selecting customers through identification of market segments; acquiring customers through promoting and advertising; retaining customers through providing quality products and services and making casual customers become rabid fans; and growing relationships with customers through gaining their trust and confidence. (Kaplan & Norton, 2004, p. 7)\n\nThe internet is one way of enhancing CRM. Customers can log on to company websites, air their views and suggestions or complaints, and even make an order of the company’s products. Many firms offer their products by way of online shopping. They also offer 24-7 service wherein customers can post comments.\n\nThis provides a positive interaction with customers, starting a long-term relationship. (Álvarez, Martín, & Casielles, 2007, p. 454) Paper billing is minimized through online billing. Firms’ websites provide customer service by answering their calls and complaints, or if the customers want to suggest something about products and services. Organisations who want to attain customer satisfaction and loyalty offer 24-hour service, seven days a week over the internet.\n\nAdditionally, the internet has become a source of information for customers about company products. Marketing executives know that the more information they acquire about customers by way of the internet, the more they can provide quality products that suit to customer specifications.\n\nThrough the internet and the company website, customers receive individualized treatment. Individualized treatment means a firm’s ability to provide products, services, and transactions to each individual client. Schrage (as cited in Álvarez et al., 2007) indicated that websites are assessed of their effectiveness ‘according to the variety they provide and their capacity for personalization’ (Álvarez et al., 2007, p. 454).\n\nThe worldwide web (www) is one of the most important technological discoveries which have influenced activities of people, countries and organisations.\n\nBusinesses use this to promote and advertise, to expand and to improve their business, to acquire more data and information for their databases, and for research and development or to build more products. Most companies, especially the global ones, have their own websites connected to the web. Customer and business interaction with the use of the Internet is common business activity.\n\nToday’s marketers have the world as their marketplace. It is a bigger place to introduce and sell products but also a wider place to analyse and deal with. Before, marketers could only focus with consumer insight of a particular place and community, now they have the ‘global village’ to deal with. It was in 1992 when marketing could be done through one-to-one approach. But now with the popularity of the internet and the information revolution, “mass customization” is becoming a trend.\n\nA question that always seems to linger in the marketer’s mind is: What do consumers think and want? This question cannot be addressed to one group of consumers but to the world. Global organisations, or businesses, think of more appropriate terms and strategies in this new, exciting or challenging marketplace. There is more than one way to kill a cat, and marketers have to be flexible and creative in “killing the cat”.\n\nMarketers have to refocus and find new ways of collecting and analyzing market data and information because of the new forces and trends in globalisation. Information is the key; there are vast amounts of information about consumers out there that have to be collected and analyzed.\n\nThis new wave of information needs broader and creative ‘geniuses’ to arrive at fresh insights for the consumers’ needs and wants to be met. Moreover, what is needed is “insight” and a careful study of the vast information acquired from the literature and from the field collected by sales people.\n\nThere is another trend in marketing and that is, ensuring that the customer longs and wants for a ‘remake’ of the product. The strategy is to aim for customer satisfaction. But customer satisfaction does not necessarily mean loyalty on the part of the customer. Many authors suggest that having continuous communication with the customer is one step to loyalty. (Stone, Abbott, Foss, McDaid, & Morrison, 2004, p. 228)\n\nCustomers have to be asked to rate the importance of particular attributes and performance levels of the product/s. They have to be asked about their willingness to repurchase and to recommend the products that they had bought and their reasons for preferences. These steps can lead us to the concept of customer loyalty.\n\nUnderstanding customers is critical to their satisfaction and loyalty. In order to address this problem, firms realise that product innovation is one of the solutions. Supply chain learning should be a part of the firm’s strategies to address customer satisfaction and loyalty. This is also the main objective of market orientation – customer satisfaction through superior performance of products (Singh, 2004, p. 3).\n\nCase studies: significance of project marketing\n\nThe project marketing approach states that a broader perspective of the business orientation of companies should be applied and not on mere individual projects. This means greater attention should be applied to the overall strategy and operation of firms. (Skaates & Tikkanen as cited in Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 2006)\n\nAnother emphasis is that project marketing must be a function in the firm and not a mere orientation. The case studies presented by Blomquist and Wilson (2006) centred on the question, ‘How do multi-project firms in these industries adapt their internal structure to their respective external environments?’ (p. 206)\n\nBackground of the case studies\n\nArtto and Wikstrom (as cited in Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 207) stated that project marketing should be placed within the context of projects as business because it is a business orientation. Their study suggested that project business did not just come from project management discipline, but is contextually related with the business environment. The study also focused on looking for business sources instead of project literature.\n\nArtto and Wikstrom (as cited in Blomquist & Wilson, 2006) focused on the organisation and not individual projects. Lawrence and Lorsch (as cited in Blomquist & Wilson) suggested that no particular project management is best suited for all situations. There is a contradiction between project based objectives and organisational learning processes. Project-basing can limit a firm’s innovative potential (Dubois and Gadde as cited in Bresnen, Goussevskaia & Swan, 2004, p. 1535).\n\nSimon (as cited in Blomquist & Wilson, 2006) stated that complex organisms, to include organisations, tend to adapt to their environments. This is applicable to both theory and practice. Kotler (as cited in Blomquist & Wilson) also indicated that there are several ways in which a firm may direct its marketing strategy, but successful ones opt for customer-oriented marketing. Lawrence and Lorsch (as cited in Blomquist & Wilson) indicated that effective organisations always adapt to their external environments.\n\nIn this age of globalisation, meeting customers’ needs and wants is a business trend. It aims to lower cost of production while keeping customer loyalty. Firms use strategies in meeting those needs and wants. Experts suggest that the best way in marketing is customer focus leading to customer satisfaction. Products and services are geared towards customer focus, and customer satisfaction is a goal in a value added supply chain. Supply chain management focuses on value added and customer satisfaction at the same time.\n\nAnother company strategy is to apply constant innovation. Firms introduce changes in organisational strategies which aim for talents, technologies and customer focus and loyalty (Venkatraman & Henderson, 2008, p. 258). Organisations have to keep in touch with customers, and look for ways to satisfy their needs and wants. Good customer relation is an important business strategy (McColl-Kennedy & Schneider, 2000, p. S884).\n\nTo get closer to the customers, businesses have to work as cohesive organisations, using tools and technology (Gulati & Oldroyd, 2005, p. 92), and focus on knowledge-based economy, slowly moving away from the industrial economy. Identifying and working out to strengthen customer satisfaction, supply chains can help in having good relationship with customers, and reduce costs; mostly, it points to the area of marketing (Smith, 1991).\n\nMarketing involves creating ideas for the good of the customers (Levitt, 1983). Supply chains are not only about ‘production and distribution mechanisms but also as important competitive weapons’ (Hult, Ketchen, & Nichols, 2002; Hult, Ketchen, & Slater as cited in Villena et al., 2009, p. 636).\n\nIn creating value, an important factor to consider is customer relationship management (Chan, 2005, p. 32). Kotler et al. (cited in Blythe, 2006, p. 5) includes the idea of value in the definition of marketing, which is ‘the relationship between what is paid and what is received, and can be increased or reduced by marketing activities’ (Blythe, p. 5).\n\nThe practice of customer-oriented approach can be understood as the organisation’s openness to the customer, or the organisation being “accountable to the customer” (Cäker, 2007, p.144). This practice of being customer-oriented is now incorporated in the organisations’ management accounting (Vaivio; Guilding & McManus as cited in Cäker, 2007, p.144).\n\nOrganisations around the world compete to gain more customers, and one way of gaining more customers is to gain their trust, answer and meet their needs and wants, to make sure that they come back. It is not enough that they buy the company’s products; it is important that they come back. Customer satisfaction should be able to gain customer loyalty. A lifelong partnership between the company and the customer should make the company last for a long time.\n\nMarketers have reformatted the way they collect and utilise market intelligence. They need more information and are redefining goals to suit to the present trend of intense globalisation.\n\nCustomer closeness is one of the requirements for customer focus and loyalty. It is important in demand-oriented capabilities and performance. Customer closeness is associated with responsiveness to customers and customisation. Supply chains can also be aimed at customisation. It is a strategy that combines operational excellence with customer closeness. (Cäker, 2007, p.144)\n\nFlexibility is another important factor in having customer closeness. Flexibility refers to being able to change and react to customer demands, or requests. A flexible organisation reacts to quick changes in the product mix. Flexibility has other ‘flexible’ connotations, such as financial performance.\n\nThere are many questions that managers and marketers ought to answer about the customer when looking for customer focus and loyalty. A study should be made on how customers behave, how they react to the product, and how they experience the product. Some questions that need to be answered by the marketer are:\n\n  * Do customers like the product or service and why?\n  * What attract customers to my product?\n  * How do customers receive the information in advertising and commercials?\n  * When is the appropriate time to convince them to buy the products?\n\nThe Gantt chart and other tools in project management\n\nProjects in different industries or sectors vary. For example, Turner (as cited in Blomquist & Wilson, 2006) indicated that projects can be classified according to how well methods and goals are described and applied. In engineering, projects can be well defined by describing the methods and goals of the project.\n\nThese successful projects are planned according to quality, cost, and timing. In contrast, organisational change projects have a high degree of failure. It is therefore recommended that in this kind of project, a soft systems approach is applied wherein judgments are applied at key points whether to continue or to abort. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006)\n\nBecause of these realities, various models have been used in the planning and conduct of projects on a case-to-case basis. Projects use the basic “Gantt-chart” method, which states the tasks and milestones of the project and provides the timing and a degree of certainty forecast.\n\nThere are also other approaches that have evolved from this method, such as the “state-gate” (Cooper), “waterfall”, “spiral”, and “helix”. State-gate is applicable for projects involving lots of product development, but the others are important in the planning and implementation of IT projects. (Blomquist & Winston, 2006, p. 208)\n\nCase study: Enerco\n\nEnerco is an engineering company providing services to large projects in the engineering sector. Its customers are large power producers and those involving power grids. A usual project for Enerco has a budget well over US$100 million, which has to be handled properly and systematically because if it fails it involves large losses.\n\nBut the firm has been involved on projects and well-conceived project management. It spends a lot for training of personnel and provides a clearly defined career path for managers and employees, from deputy site manager to site manager, to project director, and so on. Enerco’s project managers are usually at the age of 40 and up, who handle one project each annually, and other activities like pre-project preparation and marketing programs for new projects. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 210)\n\nThe firm sells similar product to its customers and activities are almost the same from project to project. Differences among projects can be on matters pertaining to financing the project, the power capacity involved, and the different versions of software used to control the system.\n\nWhat should be critically planned and managed are the design phase, building phases, and the delivery of equipment from the plant to the sites. The Gantt chart is especially useful and similar across projects. But the Gantt chart has to be adjusted in accordance with the size of the project.\n\nThe researchers conducted interviews on several managers involved in the project. One of those interviewed was the project director who said that he had to reduce the design loops in management, which meant they had to redesign, for example, when they ran into an environmentalist group that opposed the project. The project also had to consider the main points – ‘time, cost, performance, quality, and the environment’ (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 215).\n\nContract agreements usually take time because they involve political components of governments, added with environmental components. The sales process includes a pre-qualifying step with firms offering their tender for a period of 60 to 90 days. Enerco has an advantage with its competitors because it has an expert knowledge of energy transfer with minimal losses.\n\nRelationship building is important and this Enerco is quite good at. Continuity of staffing from sales to final delivery is provided. The manager responsible for sales becomes in charge of the operational phase of the project. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 210)\n\nCrane Inc.\n\nCrane Inc. has a different kind of product – loading and unloading equipment for ports and ships. It has a special know-how for this kind of technology, which is an advantage to other firms. The technology can handle bulk commodities, for example, sand, cement, coal, etc. It can load and unload ships without waste and ambient dust. Crane can handle several projects at the same time. Sales, inquiries, and tenders are the responsibility of the sales department.\n\nThe sales offer is conducted by the sales personnel, cost engineers, and the engineering personnel; these three work as a team. The negotiations are for the cost, functionality, timing, and other financing issues. When Crane wins the tender, the project is passed on from the sales manager to the project manager of the contracted project. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 210)\n\nAgain, the Gantt chart is utilized in the operation of the project, with the ‘phases of engineering, manufacture, shipping, building, testing, and hand over’ as primary parts of the project. The chart is used from project to project and Crane sees it as essential to quality service.\n\nCom Inc.\n\nCom Inc. has been involved in the telecommunications business for decades now. It started with selling equipment but rose to become a supplier of systems adapted to customer and market demands. Com customers are telephone operators; it has worked with telecom firms from many nations all over the world, and has built a strong relationship with these companies, a phenomenon known as alliance partnership. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 211)\n\nCom has a different sales process. Sometimes, it uses a system but in some instances, the company is able to introduce equipment and apparatus. Com is sometimes invited to offer tender, and the firm provides a model of the system and demonstrates to the client how the system works. Clients are given the chance to use the system and test it to work in their own operations.\n\nWhile still in the offering stage, Com sets up the requirements, installs the sets of hardware, and shows to the client the services the system can offer. In large projects, the project manager is tasked to be involved in the early stages and fill in the requirements. The services and systems involved include both software and hardware. There are also instances that Com is asked to manage and maintain the system installed.\n\nSo, multiple tasks are carried along with the contract that includes maintenance, system upgrading, and other management functions. Com Inc. has set up a world class project management procedure that focuses on business and clients’ requirements; the organisational culture of the workers who are working with the project; a project organisation with different functions that produce results for the stakeholders; and a project process with different activities and control and goals fulfilled.\n\nCom also sets a strategy wherein the interest of the client and supplier are fulfilled. The built relationship is founded on trust and understanding. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 211)\n\nIT Inc.\n\nIT Inc. is one of the largest IT firms in northern Europe with an employee population of 14,000. Its vision is to be the number one IT provider. IT Inc. is a niche producer expanding to many countries allowing it to produce more capabilities and innovations in IT-solutions for various industries. Products and services are IT-solutions such as: IT software, IT systems, and IT solutions for the various functions of the organisation.\n\nThe firm has a different sales procedure in that it is supported by project management procedures. The whole organisation bases its operation on the project management, including marketing. The staff is focused on development, training and advancement of the procedure. The company also collaborates with other providers so a support process is built. This process of the group has made it strong through the years that it has been operating. It has made the firm hold together. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 211)\n\nProject management procedures are encapsulated in a document that is sometimes adapted to the changing times. It is termed a stage-gate model. This model is a constant procedure but it states how the firm acts and how it introduces changes after a project has been completed.\n\nThe material is contained in a manual which is published, and the descriptions are provided. The long process is explained in the manual so that the managers and workers and their clients understand the expectations, the problems and the solutions offered. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 211)\n\nChristian Koch’s article on consulting engineering\n\nThis is a fascinating outlook of team and teamwork, group work, and other aspects of knowledge and information sharing – this is all about project management to the fullest. The article’s aim was to discuss how the companies cope with the dynamics of the projects in balancing various tensions around project teamworking.\n\nKoch’s case study discusses the intersection between management efforts and knowledge production teams: first, through three types of corporate management framing the knowledge production: organisational, human resource efforts and office design; and through two case examples of project teamwork processes.\n\nConsulting engineering depends much on project teamwork; knowledge is important to delivering professional service products. Engineering practices and knowledge are for knowledge-intensive professions like civil, mechanical and electrical engineering, and for project and construction management. Teamworking has to be effective while under continuous pressures in these engineering works. (Koch, 2004, p. 277)\n\nThe consulting engineering companies play a central role in knowledge production in the construction sector, and are often described as knowledge-intensive business service firms. Teamwork in project is emphasized as the all-dominating form of organisation.\n\nConsulting engineers operate as service providers for customers who are owners of the proposed building. Consulting engineering is part of a broader business service sector (Larsen; Løwendahl as cited in Koch, 2004, p. 279). The consulting engineering companies’ core competencies comprise multidisciplinary engineering, project management, construction management, structural engineering, electrical, mechanical environment and energy engineering.\n\nIn Koch’s observation of the engineers, ‘lack of time is often employed as an explanation for insufficient knowledge-sharing and use of IT systems’ (Dunford, 2000; Magnusson et al. as cited in Koch, 2004). In other projects, time is of the essence. But this is precisely the role of project management: to manage time and see to it that projects are completed successfully on schedule.\n\nIn teamworking studies, manufacturing templates continue to dominate. In the workplace, one can distinguish between strong and weak teams (Kuch and Buhl as cited in Koch, 2004, p. 283) ‘where strong teams denote the quality of working life reforms at shopfloor level, where the employees are empowered, and experience enhances decision latitude’ (Koch, p. 283).\n\nWeak teams are the management-driven type of teamwork organisation, which are not independent or cannot decide alone, little skill enhancement and an implementation process crudely characterised by top-down approaches.\n\nObservation on the case studies\n\nThe firms mentioned in the case study have different customer bases, therefore their project characteristics and the many aspects of project management varied. Enerco and Com have years of advance knowledge of upcoming projects, while the other two work their projects in shorter times. But the four companies have their own resources to respond to opportunities anytime. Crane has external agents while Com depends much on relationships with clients or alliance partnership.\n\nThe case studies cannot produce generalisations but they can be used to identify important variables in “real” cases (Yin as cited in Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 212). Case analysis can assist in the development of project marketing concepts. As we compare the four companies, we can deduce that there are some similarities, for instance, the offer or the tender provides a promise to produce results contained in the contract. Trust and confidence have to be developed in the ability of the supplier company to deliver the services stipulated in the contract. Customers provided the trust and were committed to a long-term partnership. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 213)\n\nBut there were contrasts noted on the case studies. The pre-operational activities were different for the two industries. The engineering firms considered the activity as a sales activity, that’s why during the early negotiations and the offer of tender, sales people were involved. In the Crane case, the project management team only took over when the agreement had been reached.\n\nFor the Enerco case, the sales person responsible in the initial phase followed the project up to the planning and implementation. On the other hand, the IT firms were concerned of building a mutual understanding with their clients. There were feasibility studies involved and a number of changes were introduced; a discussion ensued after which the agreement was reached.\n\nWe can conclude that there is a commonality when firms within an industry conduct project management and project marketing. For the engineering firms, the commonality was noted in the planning and control: they used a Gantt chart for their projects. There were clearly defined situations in the engineering firm projects and because of this, it was possible to separate the sales and project operations. Crane used agents outside the company to solicit proposals.\n\nWhen the contract was won, the project started with the responsibilities passed on from department to another. Enerco had little separation between the departments, but their project managers were involved even during the pre-project work and in the marketing activities. Enerco’s projects are large projects and their engineers are affected by these large and complex projects.\n\nIn the case of the IS/IT firms, project marketing and project management were observed similar. At IT Inc., a project management approach was provided in the marketing activity. Customer needs were met through the capabilities and resources of the company. Com Inc. had a close partnership with its clients.\n\nThis partnership became the basis for the agreements reached. IT Inc.’s project management skills provided the company the competitive edge over other IT firms. Moreover, the two IT firms used the “stage-gate” approach to project management. The explanation for the term is that the firm ‘would get a certain stage’, obtain a meeting with the client and then proceed with the rest of transactions, perhaps make decisions based on those meetings. (Blomquist & Wilson, 2006, p. 214)\n\nA study on the role of the project manager in the implementation of Information Resources Project Manager (IRPM) was conducted by Jane Johansen and Sharlett Gillard in a paper titled Information Resources Project Management Communication: Personal and Environmental Barriers, in which the authors emphasised of knowledge as more than a set of information but a task of contextualising it to change the processes in a corporation. (Johansen & Gillard, 2005, p. 91)\n\nPresent project managers have sophisticated roles. They now find themselves revolutionising the concept of what information management means to the organisation. Project managers lead multi-departmental or multi-organisational ad hoc projects. They also are drivers of organisational learning. They have the responsibility to help their organisations make sense of their interpretation of the environment. IRPM must be fully aware of the barriers to effective communication. (Johansen & Gillard, 2005)\n\nJohansen and Gillard provided a brief theoretical review of communications barriers that serve as a checklist for the IRPM whose attention must be directed more heavily to audience and the “humanness” of communications. Workers in the information world, those who create new languages and means of locating and storing information, must now be the messengers of the new age’s understanding about information. What is important is the knowledge created from the information. (Johansen & Gillard, 2005, p. 91)\n\nThe Southwest Airlines story\n\nBased from the case studies above is a business strategy success story, that of Southwest Airlines. Southwest Airlines has a coherent business strategy which includes low costs allowing it to enter markets which others cannot. The structure includes a high degree of decentralized management, permitting high morale of employees and also allowing them to be creative.\n\nIt has introduced corporate gimmicks like unusually painted airplanes and antics introduced by CEO Herbert Kelleher. Everyone inside the plane including pilots cooperate to make the customers feel at home and happy. Low costs enable the company to be free of other airlines’ price war. Customers feel valued while competitors cannot easily copy their strategy. (McAfee, 2002, p. 49)\n\nThe management of Southwest is good at motivating employees, making them enthusiastic about their job, and allow them to get involved in managing and providing service to customers. (Freiberg & Freiberg, 1998, p. 3)\n\nThe employees are well motivated into making their own decisions and doing things which are not the ordinary. They hug, kiss, cry, or do comical things, which make customers laugh and enjoy while they are flying. This is another unique brand of customer service, a kind of company strategy making it on top of all the others.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1994, the airline industry was losing but Southwest was profitable each during the period, and was the only airline to earn a profit every year since 1973. The airline also maintains a considerable amount of debt and uses internally generated funds, making it not to worry too much of outside debts.\n\nKnowledge management: an organisational framework\n\nKnowledge management is an important phenomenon in organisations entering the age of the information revolution, information systems, the internet, and globalisation.\n\nHow do organisations conduct KM strategies? This was one of the main objectives of the Henley Knowledge Management Forum – to examine whether firms of different orientation and objectives agree or vary in their approach to knowledge management. (Truch & Bridger, 2002)\n\nTechnological advancement and continuous innovations have motivated organisations to react to changes in the global competition. Organisations have to reorganize, re-evaluate and reprogram outdated functional programs and activities, and realign them to the present trends for improvement and competition.\n\nThe challenges of globalisation are so immense for organisations of the 21 st century. Continuous changes in the workplace, mostly involving technology, knowledge, and their effective implementation, are the emerging regular activities for managers and their staff.\n\nIn the age of globalisation, knowledge is both a product and resource. Organisations are now focused on knowledge-based economies, and are more concerned with the knowledge people possess, or what is termed ‘people-embodied knowhow’. Firms invest much on intellectual capital. (Rodriguez and de Pablos, 2002, p. 174)\n\nOrganisations are now focusing on intangible assets, i.e. creating sustainable value by putting more weight on intangible assets, e.g. human capital and employee capabilities, organisational knowledge, customer relationships and brands, other capabilities, and so on. (Kaplan & Norton, 2004a, p. 3)\n\nKnowledge and knowledge management are significant developments in the new globalising environment. There are various kinds of organisational knowledge but the most common forms are tacit and explicit. Knowledge management and the creation of knowledge are phases or steps very much present in the study of organisational forms.\n\nKnowledge management in the context of the physical place of an organisation draws one’s attention to the philosophy proposed by the Japanese philosopher Kitaro Nishida (Nonaka and Konno, 2008, p. 40). “Ba” is a Japanese term which means “shared space” that serves as a basis for the formation of individual and collective knowledge. Knowledge can be acquired through experience and when these two are separated, it becomes information.\n\nA review of the literature on knowledge management provided an initial background that organisations have less KM strategies. KM strategy is not a regular organisational requirement, nor a part of long-term planning. Mintzberg (as cited in Truch & Bridger, 2002) conducted a study on strategy formation in organisations, in which he identified at least ten formations, and concluded that dealing with only one process can be overwhelming. The success of a strategy, according to Mintzberg’s study, depends on the way it was implemented.\n\nThe Henley Knowledge Management Forum (as cited in Truch & Bridger, 2002) focused on knowledge management practices in organisations, instead of the KM strategy. Miles and Snow (as cited in Truch & Bridger, 2002) found in a study four strategic categories of organisations that dealt with knowledge management. These are:\n\n 1. Defenders – These are organisations with limited product-market targets. The managers in this organisation are experts in their area of operation but do not look for new ways to expand. Because of this, these organisations, their managers and their stakeholders, do not have to create and provide major innovations and adjustments in their technology infrastructure and organisational structure. They devote their time to promoting and improving what they have in their existing operational strategy. (Truch & Bridger, 2002, p. 909)\n 2. Prospectors – are organisations that continuously look for market opportunities and conduct tests to emerging trends. These organisations introduce change and encounter risks and uncertainty, forcing their competitors to respond. Nevertheless, these organisations are more concerned with product and market innovation, making their operations not too efficient. (Truch & Bridger, 2002, p. 909)\n 3. Analysers – are organisations that are wise to operate on two types of market segments, one stable and the other continuously changing. In their stable field, they use a formalised and systematic structures and processes. But in their unstable areas, their managers observe the environment and their competitors, looking for new ways and ideas, and then they adopt some of those ideas that can provide a promising strategy. (Truch & Bridger, 2002, p. 909)\n 4. Reactors – are organisations in which their strategists perceive change and uncertainty in the industry but are unable to act accordingly effectively. With this, the organisation does not have a consistent structure to react to immediate changes, and cannot adjust so rapidly according to the changing times. (Truch & Bridger, 2002, p. 909)\n\nMaterials, labor, and other resources are used to produce goods or services, at the same time adding value to the project. The project life cycle is given life by three key players, namely: the customer, or the client, who is also known as the buyer; the contractor, who is responsible to the customer for carrying out the project task; and the project manager, who is employed by the contractor to plan and manage the project activities from start to finish.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization provides strict guidance for competencies of project personnel. Project personnel should be able to successfully manage projects. They have to be encouraged to develop these competencies so that goals and objectives are achieved. The project team should have competent individuals who can expertly apply their knowledge and experience in order to deliver the necessary results. (“Guidance on project management,” 2011, p. 12)\n\nProject management should be able to manage stakeholders. Management and plans for stakeholders should be developed. There might be stakeholders who oppose the project because of the impact of the project. In this case, diplomacy and tact are needed in negotiating stakeholders who oppose. If matters don’t get resolved, it is important that the project organisation consult a higher authority, or acquire the services of external individuals in resolving the issue. (“Guidance on project management,” 2011, p. 24)\n\nCase study: Toyota\n\nOne of the global firms who have successfully made use of knowledge management applied to project management is Toyota, a world leader in car manufacturing. Toyota has an effective project management with an efficient and competitive workforce. In the 1950s, Toyota started car making with 18,000 vehicles per year.\n\nToyota introduced a unique production system, unique in the annals of car making. The Toyota production system is a Japanese way of mass producing cars but with small volumes. Toyota exported its cars and began to open manufacturing plants in many areas including the United States. (Lynch, 2008, p. 772)\n\nToyota has survived through the years. Its programs, strategies, and plans of the future are as strong as ever. The past can build a future for Toyota. Its management is institutionalized as well as the personalities behind the founding and operations. Toyota is a long tradition of management from its original founder down to a long line of car builders and business innovators. To mark it all, Toyota has not recorded operating loss since the 1940s.\n\nToyota’s strength springs from its operational and production strategies and the people behind the system. Its workforce is composed of well-trained engineers and technicians who are trained inside not outside the company thereby maintaining their unique way of building cars. Toyota does not believe in firing employees; it trains its own work force and not in a university or from other outside sources. This could be one of the reasons why despite the Prius problem, management has maintained that quality has always been a Toyota trademark.\n\nThe continual improvement concept is, in fact, continuing and commendable. The company went international and established manufacturing plants around the world. Toyota has maintained its workforce, making sure they remain in the company for longer period even during economic crisis, such as the Prius problem.\n\nAnother concept used by Toyota workforce is the kaizen , which is to mean continual improvement. Toyota’s experienced project managers follow a pattern in manufacturing cars. Other innovations also were for an increase of market share: dealer networks and cheap car finance for customers. Through outsourcing and a good relationship with its suppliers because of an effective communication network via the internet and Information Technology, the company was able to minimize surplus inventory and lower cost of parts and products.\n\nPlanning a project involves establishing calendars or milestones. The project has to rely on some calendars established for each project. Work time has to be set for the team members and make a resource calendar for those activities.\n\nAn application of a unique project management was applied on one of Toyota’s significant projects, the production of the hybrid car Prius. Prius was known as the car of the future. It started as a mere idea and innovation of other Toyota cars to a contribution of inputs and knowledge from Toyota’s database and expertise of Toyota engineers.\n\nThe project was a promise fulfilled by Toyota to help reduce materials detrimental to the environment and to see to it that manufacturing plants are environmentally friendly. The decision to push through with the project was motivated by Toyota’s desire to help in minimising global warming, and the need for low-emission vehicles.\n\nThe project gave Toyota an opportunity to break old technical systems with revolutionary, environmentally friendly technologies. Toyota has been into the program of Zero Emission Vehicle, and one of Prius’s features is its being fuel efficient. (Lynch, 2008, p. 773)\n\nPrius was a combination of an engine and a motor. Its engineering program was done almost entirely in-house. It was then mass produced, the first hybrid car to be mass-produced.\n\nThe in-house strategy was effective. Aside from economic returns, the technique of embedding knowledge in Prius provided internal knowledge for Toyota technicians and engineers. The company’s R&D introduced a lot of innovations. R&D people made suggestions and concepts for product development from its database of knowledge. Prius was intended to be the global car of the 21 st century.\n\nIt can be concluded that Prius is a product of expert knowledge management reinforced with data and information from a database of experiences and expertise of a dedicated work force working as a team for Toyota. Knowledge management played a great role in the decision to pursue the Prius project.\n\nMapping business strategies\n\nAs mentioned, firms are focusing on intangible assets. This is a trend, a new business strategy, which is itself a phenomenon. Normally, a company’s intangible assets may comprise about 75 percent or more of the company’s market value, while about 25 percent represent the tangible assets. Kaplan and Norton (2004a) have introduced a powerful management tool, the balanced score cards.\n\nA strategy map describes the important components of how value is created within the organisation. It emphasises on themes that focus on strategy dynamics. With this, a new framework is formed for describing, measuring and enhancing human capital, information, and organisational capital. A strategy map presents four perspectives, which are: ‘financial, customer, internal, and learning and growth’ (Kaplan & Norton, 2004b, p. 2).\n\nA strategy map guides a company from strategy formulation to strategy execution. The strategy should provide concrete perspectives about price, quality, service, brand formulation, and other significant parts of the marketing mix and business.\n\nThe Balanced Scorecard describes the company’s value formulation and measurement. Important aspects include identification of the jobs, the systems used, the working climate, the organisational milieu, and how all this supports the value-creating internal structure. (Kaplan & Norton, 2004b, p. 4)\n\nAn example of a positive outcome of strategy map is provided in Gray-Syracuse, a manufacturer of precision casting parts. By formulating its strategy map, it was able to reduce expensive job by minimising reworks. Precious time of workers was cut in half. It also improved quality and customer satisfaction.\n\nStrategy maps enhance outstanding performance in operations management, customer relationship, innovation, and regulatory and social perspectives.\n\nOperating processes are about production and delivery of products. Operational excellence will help in strategic execution. Operations management includes: developing financially strong supplier partnerships, produce quality products, deliver products to end users, and reduce risk. (Kaplan & Norton, 2004, p. 5)\n\nOperational processes can be improved through activity-based management (ABM) and total quality management (TQM). Through ABM, managers can get good results with reduced costs. TQM is all about improving quality in a product or service, and introducing quality in a company’s activities.\n\nOrganisational strategies\n\nOrganisational strategies are based on an organisation’s mission, vision and policies. Projects are the means in which organisations attain their goals.\n\nA value creation framework is shown in Figure 1.\n\nStrategic goals provide a framework for the creation of opportunities. Opportunities should be selected based on the benefits gained and management of risks. The project goal is the measure for chosen opportunities. The project objective adds more meaning to the project goal by providing the deliverables. When the benefits are realised, project goals are accomplished. This requires time as the objectives are already set. (“Guidance on project management,” 2011, p. 9)\n\nMajority of companies in the industrial sectors, like the automobile sector, the manufacturers and suppliers evolve within the framework of a strategy. They have to position themselves in a multidimensional complex environment. In their interaction, the companies form a network of two or more companies, with the network characterized by relations of exchanges between individuals or groups. (Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al., 2009, p. 34)\n\nThere is now the relationship between the manufacturer and a supplier including the subcontractors who suggest what customer needs and that these needs should be met. The manufacturer then becomes involved from the start. Another situation is codesigning, a network wherein the supplier is involved in the design of the product. The manufacturer and the supplier become partner in this instance. In this situation, management and marketing have to mobile their resources to do a project. This is known as the “fourth phase” of project management, which is to integrate marketing parameters, to gather in project ideas. (Lecoeuvre-Soudain et al., 2009, p. 35)\n\nOpportunity identification\n\nOrganisations have capabilities by which they can develop a list of opportunities. Opportunities have to be evaluated so that top management can decide and identify feasible projects that will benefit the organisation. Some examples of opportunities may address a problem for a new market demand, an organisational requirement, or a legal requirement.\n\nSome organisations require the services of a project sponsor in articulating goals and benefits. The process may also require a justification wherein management may obtain an approval for investment. The evaluation process provides criteria for financial investment appraisal techniques, and some form of qualitative criteria that may include strategic alignment, environmental impact, etc. It may differ from one organisational project to another. (“Guidance on project management,” 2011, p. 9)\n\nSome factors on the project environment that will affect the success of the project include:\n\n  * Factors beyond the control of the organisation, for example, socio-economic, geographical, political, technological, etc.\n  * Factors considered within the organisational boundary, for example, strategy, technology, availability of resources, organisational culture. (“Guidance on project management,” 2011, p. 9)\n\nThe project organisation includes the project manager who leads the activities until its completion; the project management team which provides assistance to the project manager in the project activities; the project team which also contributes to the project success. (“Guidance on project management,” 2011, p. 12)\n\nLack of Project Management\n\nWhat will come out if there is no skilled project management? This section will tackle the question of lack of appropriate project management on a project.\n\nThe Standish Group International, Inc. reports that failure in application software development for corporate America accounts to about $275 billion each year on about 200,000 software projects.\n\nProject failure in IT development has been described as legion. Various situations or scenarios could be some of the reasons, and one of these is the lack of skilled project management. Project managers lack enterprise-wide knowledge and control and tracking tools. Many don’t even have enough knowledge to comprehend the entire system. One of the major reasons is underestimating project complexity. The Standish Group described it as lack of software project management. ( Chaos: a recipe for success , 1999, p. 1)\n\nIT development has proved to be not so simple. In 2005, it was estimated that the amount involved in the development of IT hardware, software, and services worldwide reached $1 trillion. And from this amount, about 5 to 15 percent did not reach its full potential because they were either abandoned or did not fully respond to the needs of the clients or customers.\n\nFailures in IT programming and implementation could be attributed to many factors, but analysts have a big role to play in these so-called IT failure. It is also believed that this happens in most organisations who have implemented IT in their business functions. (Dennis, Wixom, & Roth, 2008, p. 6)\n\nThe roles of individual analysts and managers are not clearly defined, or they do lack the appropriate skill. The system analyst has an important role in System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The ultimate objective is to create value for the organisation and increase profits.\n\nLike the business analyst, the system analyst analyses the business situation, looks for business improvements, and incorporates these into the information system for implementation. Systems failed because the business analyst failed to fully understand his/her role in building a system. The analyst misunderstood by building a wonderful system instead of making it support the organisation’s objectives and functions. (Dennis et al., 2008, p. 6)\n\nA table of IT failures is presented in the table below.\n\nSOURCE: System analysis and design, by Dennis et al. (2008, p. 7)\n\nWasted resources and distorted reputation for the IT department or organisation are one of the results of IT failures. It was reported that the primary causes of failure are organisational issues, lack of skilled project management, and not technical causes. (Dennis et al., 2008, p. 7)\n\nAccording to the website ZDNet, the cost of IT failure has reached $3 trillion. ( ZDNet, 2012, para. 1)\n\nThere are many reasons that can be cited here but the ultimate one cited in the literature is lack of skilled project management. Project management is a process that starts from inception to end of the project wherein the finished product can be delivered to the buyer or customer. But it appears that many of the IT development software could not be delivered and others were abandoned. Project management must be a collaboration of the entire team. No project has been successful without teamwork.\n\nIt’s not all negative. According to the Standish Group report, in 1994 16% of the application development projects were considered successful. This meant the projects were completed on time and delivered to the clients with the necessary requirements or specifications.\n\nThe Standish Group classified the projects into: successful (completed on time with all the necessary requirements); challenged (completed but the project exceeded the budget, and not on time, and not all requirements were fulfilled); and failed (the project was not completed and abandoned).\n\nThe Standish Group pointed out the three factors that affect a project’s success: the project size, the size of the team conducting the project, and the required time for completion. Bigger projects have less chances of success. Stats from the Standish Group revealed that projects with less than $750,000 budget were more successful than the large budgeted ones. ( Chaos: a recipe for success , 1999, p. 3)\n\nThe Standish Group provided the “ingredients” for a recipe for project success. The three major factors can be user involvement, management support and clear project objectives. When these factors are brought together, they account for about 50% chances of success. ( Chaos: a recipe for success , 1999, p. 4)\n\nBut the most influential factor for a project to succeed is user involvement. Users or clients have to be actively involved in the project development, from start to finish. They should be involved in the design and testing and subsequent implementation of the software.\n\nThe Standish Group formulated the Chaos Ten formula for project success. First is user involvement, an allocation of 20 points; executive support, 15 points; clear business objectives, should have 15 points; experienced project manager, must also have 15 points; small milestones, with 10 points; firm basic requirements, to have 5 points; competent staff, another 5 points; proper planning, ownership, and other, 5 points apiece. ( Chaos: a recipe for success , 1999, p.4)\n\nTotal Quality Management (TQM)\n\nTQM was first introduced in manufacturing operations in the 1950s. When it was proven effective, it was then applied to other sectors, including the construction industry. TQM is used to apply continuous improvement on the product, including processes and people, identifying client requirements and how the process can be achieved.\n\nThe principle behind TQM is that it must be adopted across the whole organisation. It should include the different functions, like customer service, production and manufacturing, marketing, and so on; otherwise, it will not be effective. (“Project quality management,” n.d., p. 7.3)\n\nWith TQM, the organisation will have an enhanced HRM with employees involved in the process. Employees, ranging from top management to the workers, are motivated and committed to work for the organisation. There will be improved team work and management because of improved communication and understanding of the internal processes and activities.\n\nAnother important contribution is increased customer satisfaction and customer retention as a result of better understanding of customer specifications. Product and service costs are also reduced due to enhanced development cycle, improved team coordination, shorter time lines and better inventory of products and services. (“Project quality management,” n.d., p. 7.4)\n\nMethods/Research Design\n\nMethods and methodology are two distinct subjects. A method is a technique or procedure in collecting and analysing data. Methodology includes other aspects of the research design and choice of particular methods, including justification for the research objectives.\n\nSurveys are popular for researchers. In fact, most interchange the words survey and research. Surveys are often conducted to know the opinions of a great number of people on a particular issue or topic. In conducting surveys, the researcher asks a number of questions to gain a number of answers on the topic at hand. (Fraenkel and Wallen, 2006, p. 397)\n\nThere are features in survey research which are applicable to this dissertation. Survey research is more of a quantitative research than qualitative. The latter involves participant observation and unstructured interviewing which is conducted to acquire as much information and opinion from the participants. Quantitative is regarded as ‘sterile and unimaginative’, but can provide ‘factual, descriptive information’, the so-called hard evidence (De Vaus, 2002, p. 5).\n\nThere are three major characteristics of surveys:\n\n 1. Surveys contain information from a group of people that describes the people’s opinion, attitudes and beliefs;\n 2. Surveys use questions to acquire the information, and the answers to the questions become the data of the study;\n 3. Surveys extract the information from the participants of a sample that is representative of the population, and not from the entire population. (Fraenkel and Wallen, 2006, p. 397)\n\nReliability and Validity\n\nReliability and validity are a form of measurement, by which without it, the survey research hardly makes sense. A researcher has to have a ‘high degree of reliability’ on a survey before he can have validity (Alwin, 2007, p. 290). Internal validity is not a problem to survey research because surveys do not allow cause-and-effect relationships (Dumont, 2008, p. 29).\n\nValidity refers to the problem of whether what was the result of the data collection reflects the true picture of the units of analysis, or what is being studied. The data collected should not be a product of the research method but of what is being studied. (McNeill and Chapman, 2005, p. 9; Groves, 2004, p. 3)\n\nA research must have a research problem. The purpose of this paper is generally to collect data and information on an important subject known as project marketing and its relation to project management. After collecting the desired data and information, the researcher formulated a hypothesis, analysed the data and arrived at a new knowledge based on the data and information.\n\nThe dissertation also analysed the hypothesis with the literature and collected data, and formulated a conclusion and recommendation. This, in a sense, is the final purpose of this paper: how to attain project success with the application of project marketing.\n\nProject managers can save a lot of efforts by making decisions before they begin a task or resource data. The first is to establish calendars or milestones. The project relies on some calendars that are established for each project and for some project resources. This process is aided by the vast amount of information from the organisation’s database.\n\nReferences\n\nAldrich, H. (2008). Organizations and environments .

      "Nestle’s Marketing Mix Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nToday’s business environment presents numerous challenges for new and existing organizations. As such, business entities have had to come up with effective and efficient operational strategies in order to remain relevant and profitable in an increasingly competitive arena.\n\nTo achieve this aim, marketing tools and strategies have been used extensively to ensure that a business meets the needs of the customers, has a competitive edge over its rivals and remains profitable in aggressive market situations.\n\nKotler et al (2005) define marketing as the process through which a business plans and executes its concepts regarding products, prices, promotion and distribution of goods and services in order to facilitate exchanges that optimally satisfy the consumer’s and organizational needs, goals and objectives.\n\nMarketing Mix: 4 P’s of Marketing\n\nThe marketing mix is arguably the mot important aspect in marketing. This is attributed to the fact that it covers the basic concepts (4 P’s) of successful marketing. These concepts are price, place, product and promotion.\n\nIs used wisely, the marketing mix leads to successful marketing strategies, which in turn guarantees profitability, consumer loyalty, competitive advantage and increased market share for an organization.\n\nThis paper shall set out to analyze the market mix of Canada based Nestlé company. The strategies used to determine the product, price place and promotion of goods and services offered by this company shall be discussed and an analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats affecting the company’s market provided. The effects of using social media in Nestlé’s marketing plan shall also be evaluated.\n\nNestlé Canada: Company overview\n\nNestlé Company was founded in 1867 after the founder saw an untapped opportunity in the production of milk-based baby formula. The product quickly gained prominence due its nutritional value and acceptability by the target population. Since then, the company has been actively involved in the production of nutritional food and beverages.\n\nNestlé Company is the largest Food and Beverage Company in the world with an employee base of over 280, 000 employees working in the company’s factories in almost every country in the world (Nestlé Canada, 2012). As a result of this global reach, high reputation and quality products, Nestlé Canada Inc. records over $1 billion in sales.\n\nNestlé Canada marketing mix Assessment\n\nProducts\n\nKotler et al (2005), state that the product aspect of the marketing mix refers to the total concept being offered to the consumer. As such, product consist s of the intangible aspects of the product (brand name, product line and customer services) and the tangible aspects such as raw materials used, features and accessories.\n\nNestlé Canada offers a variety of products that cater for different needs of the target consumers. The variety of products offered to consumers enables the company to reach a larger market base since they have different products for everyone.\n\nThe table below shows the product line and products offered to cater for different needs of the consumers in the Canadian market (Nestlé Canada, 2012).\n\nTable showing products and services offered by Nestlé Canada\n\nFrom this table, it is evident that Nestlé Canada offers a variety of products brands that cater for different needs of various clients. Having such a wide variety of products has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the company stays ahead of competition and has a wider market share.\n\nConsumers have a wide range of products to choose from. As such, the need to get substitutes from other companies is minimized.\n\nPrice\n\nArguably, one of the selling points of Nestlé Canada has been its ability to consistently provide quality products to its clients at competitive and affordable prices. Price is mainly determined by the cost of production, quality of the product and availability of substitutes.\n\nHowever, Nestlé Canada has had a competitive advantage in this regard due to its reliance on the vast resources and skills acquired by the parent company over the century.\n\nThis enables Nestlé Canada to produce quality products at low costs, thereby enabling the company to avail its products to clients at an affordable price. While some of the substitutes offered by competing firms are cheaper, the quality of Nestlé Canada’s product still remain unmatched.\n\nPlace\n\nNestlé Canada has forged strategic alliances with various retail and wholesale vendors and distributors. As such, the products of the company can easily be found in all locations through various outlets such as convenience stores, drug stores, grocery outlets, vending machines, discount stores and supermarkets among others.\n\nThis distribution strategy enables Nestlé Canada to reach its clients far and wide. In addition, it fosters consumer loyalty since the products are easily accessible and constantly available to clients everywhere.\n\nPromotion\n\nNestlé Canada uses various advertising and promotion strategies such as TV and radio advertisements, print media and online advertising in various websites. In addition, the company uses discounts and special offers to attract more consumers.\n\nTo promote various brands, Nestlé Canada uses witty slogans on their products packaging and advertisements that seek to raise the image and lifestyle positioning represented by the product.\n\nThese strategies have seen products such as KitKat and Nestlé’s Smarties record strong brand loyalty and market positioning over the past few years (Nestlé Canada, 2012). This is attributed to the implied message this promotional strategies send to target markets.\n\nSWOT Analysis of Nestlé Canada\n\nStrengths\n\nNestlé Canada provides its market with strong brands that offer consumers unique tastes unmatched by rival companies. The products are made from the finest raw materials and subjected to intensive research in order to guarantee safety and quality for consumers.\n\nDue to its access to vast resources owner by Nestlé Company, Nestlé Canada has adequate resources for research and technology, which enables the company to continue being creative and innovative.\n\nWith such resources, Nestlé Canada is better placed to improve on their products, come up with new products and offer competitive prices to consumers. This minimizes competition and boosts profitability since Nestlé Canada rides on the good reputation developed over the years by the parent company.\n\nThe efficiency of the selected distribution channels ensures that Nestlé Canada’s products reach more consumers and are readily available. This guarantees consumer loyalty and market expansion.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMost of the products produced by Nestlé Canada target consumers between the ages of 16 and 24 years old. This market segment consists of people that do not have a lot of disposable income, work part-time and are cautious about what they eat.\n\nThis means that the majority of the populations are not well represented. Competitors who offer more products for these market segments may therefore use this weakness to their advantage and displace Nestlé Canada’s market position. In addition, some of the brands produced by Nestlé Canada have little dominance in the Canadian market.\n\nThis is an indication that Nestlé Canada’s brands campaign is not as effective as it ought to be. Due to this weakness, competitors such as Cadbury and Hershey Canada have launched substitute products that are increasingly dominating the market.\n\nOpportunities\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Nestlé Canada has access to vast resources attributed to the parent company’s pool of international branches. These resources can be directed towards training and retraining marketing personnel to facilitate marketing efficiency.\n\nMarket segmentation in the food and beverage market is not fully exploited in Canada. As such, Nestlé Canada can come up with more products that service the needs of potential consumers within the ignored product lines (baby nutrition, healthy nutrition and sport nutrition).\n\nThreat\n\nThe main threat for Nestlé Canada emanates from the fact that the company is in its maturity stage in the production cycle. This means that not much can be done to improve the products since they have attained the best level of quality and consumer loyalty is high for these products.\n\nWith this in mind, competitors may come up with products that are similar to those produced by Nestlé Canada because they are certain that consumers prefer those products.\n\nSolutions to the negative aspects of Nestlé Canada’s market mix\n\nAs has been mentioned herein, the main threat to Nestlé Canada marketing mix is competition from new and existing companies through product differentiation. This can be solved by developing and marketing new products that attract new market shares.\n\nIn so doing, the company will be able to maintain its reputation, all the while providing new and existing consumers with more products. In regard to poor brand campaign strategies, training may help the marketing department develop up to date strategies for effective marketing.\n\nIn addition, adopting sales maximization strategy rather than a profit maximization strategy while marketing the less dominant brands may influence more consumers into buy them. This can be done by reducing the prices and providing special offers for such brands.\n\nImpact of social media to Nestlé Canada’s marketing mix\n\nSocial media have been instrumental to the marketing strategy of Nestlé Canada. This is attributed to the fact that social media outlets provide a cheap and convenient platform through which market, product and pricing research can be done.\n\nThrough various websites, marketers can get feedbacks on how a product is or how it can be improved. In addition, consumers can comment on what they want in new products. Also, companies can get valuable information about competitors through social media forums.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper set out to assess the marketing mix of Nestlé Canada. To that end, the product, price, promotion and place aspects of the company’s marketing strategy have been discussed and an analysis if the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the same offered.\n\nSolutions on how the flaws in the company’s marketing strategy can be alleviated have also been provided. The impacts of social media as marketing channels have also been highlighted. If used wisely, the marketing mix can enable companies market their products and services efficiently and successfully.\n\nReferences\n\nKotler, P. et al. (2005).

      "LinkedIn as a Networking Media for Business Essay\n\nSocial networking sites have become very common on the World Wide Web today (Gowel, 2011). The users of these sites are able to create individual and corporate profiles in order to search for friends, colleagues and professional assistance.\n\nThe users can be able to link up with other individuals from all walks of life within or outside their organizations. Users convey both public and private messages to many people and end up expanding their network while bringing on board a vast array of colleagues and individuals (Gowel, 2011).\n\nUnlike social websites such as Face-book, Twitter and others, which are utilized by users of all ages for socialization or common interest, LinkedIn is quite a different site, because it is mainly used in professional networking (Gowel, 2011).\n\nAt the moment about forty five million individual professionals are using the site to share ideas, information, job opportunities and innovations (Gowel, 2011).\n\nWhen a user creates an account with LinkedIn, they are able to search for contacts and link up to networks, such as the “I-O practitioners” and the “SIOP network” (Gowel, 2011).\n\nLinkedIn which is a giant network has a specific objective of linking up professionals toward networking and provides options which allow them to add information to their individual and corporate profile.\n\nThe information added includes, work history, specific interest and references (Gowel, 2011). The network also allows the users to get in touch and get updated with any new interesting professional information (Gowel, 2011).\n\nLinkedIn is years ahead of the other professional social networks which are being utilized by professionals who use it to achieve their goals (Muccio, Burns & Murrah, 2009).\n\nAlthough LinkedIn’s most valuable technical features have not materially changed since it was officially launching in the year 2003, the tangible value that the platform now provides wasn’t accessible until recently.\n\nThis core, valuable functionality has the potential of changing the way organizations and individuals plan and manage their institutional and professional growth (Gowel, 2011).\n\nThe site for instance, can be used to grow an organization’s employees through direct consultation and training using its platform. LinkedIn can be used to enhance revenue generation, build market share, attract investor confidence and improve employee hiring process (Gowel, 2011).\n\nThrough the use of LinkedIn professionals can refine their expertise get informed on the best industrial practices in order to be empowered on how to take up bigger opportunities.\n\nIt can also be used to effectively train more people to assist them to comfortably take up new skilled jobs (Gowel, 2011). It can be used to amplify the actions which are being performed at an organization by instilling new ideas and information about the best practices of handling a given management & operational function of an organization (Gowel, 2011).\n\nIn comparison to other social networks, LinkedIn gives a vast array of products for free and it is the best way to generate ‘leads’ and gain key ‘introductions’ for most businesses (Gowel, 2011).\n\nLinkedIn allows an individual to enhance the value of his or her own relationship and work towards the growth of a personal brand (Gowel, 2011). It is a powerful platform for use by the hardworking, value-producing and ethical individuals who are not getting much out of their networks as they think they deserve to (Gowel, 2011).\n\nSuch an individual always thinks that, “If people knew me and the exceptional work I am doing, I would achieve my business goals much faster.” On the other hand, if your efforts or brands have not positively impacted anybody else, LinkedIn will make your market penetration to increase (Gowel, 2011).\n\nMost features on LinkedIn are similar to those on other socials networks such as face-book. On LinkedIn, a user can list his events and invite ‘contacts’ to join the site. The site can calculate the number of people in a single individual’s profile, which then gives us an idea of how vast access LinkedIn exposes individual to (Gowel, 2011).\n\nThat is to imply that, when you add one person to your network, you are also connected to their network as well, which makes LinkedIn a very powerful networking platform (Port, 2010).\n\nAnother distinct feature of LinkedIn is that the site gives the user recommendations. A user is able to give and receive written recommendations from colleagues (Port, 2010).\n\nFor instance, a user may ask a former employer or co-worker to write a brief recommendation for him by sending him a link (Port, 2010). The site also allows the user to create a separate profile for their company or business, which can help to market its brands (Port, 2010).\n\nLinkedIn offers a unique feature called ‘the degree of connection’ which enables users to have ‘added individuals’ to be listed either as first, second, or third degree (Port, 2010).\n\nLinkedIn applications functions just like on face-book. You can link to your blog and import your blog postings (Port, 2010). You can also link your twitter account so that your information shows up on LinkedIn profile (Port, 2010).\n\nWhen doing a search for individuals and companies on the site you can import your contacts from popular emails programs and link them to LinkedIn (Port, 2010). You can also create groups in LinkedIn focused on a hobby, or more likely, a topic to your business (Port, 2010).\n\nIn conclusion it can be noted that, LinkedIn is a networking media for business professionals. It is a tool to use in a business, career management, education, social endeavors and probably a whole lot more functions.\n\nWhen you are in business, you can turn the ‘contacts’ on LinkedIn to clients. This therefore indicates that, LinkedIn is a modern information communication technology platform which can be harnessed by businesses to drive the global economy to greater heights.\n\nReferences\n\nGowel, D.

      "Global Commerce: Asian Market Venture Report\n\nIntroduction\n\nScientific invention and innovation in transport and communication has facilitated growth of international trade. International trade is an element of globalisation that has necessitated the movement of factors of production across borders. Asian countries are experiencing rapid economic growth; they are offering an increased market to businesses with a capacity to trade internationally.\n\nRecognising the benefits of the market, Eastvaco has decided to diversify its services to the Asian market particularly in China and Indonesia where the plant will be established.\n\nThe only hindrance that the company is likely to face is financing the foreign plant. For a successful business, adequate finances are required, thus before the venture, the company will undertake a comprehensive research about the market and tape appropriate measures (Wu, 2006). This report discusses external and internal forces that are likely to affect the company.\n\nExternal factors in Asian\n\nFor an international venture, the expanding company need to undertake a P.E.S.T.L.E. analysis of the country and probably concentrate most on the areas that are likely to affect the company directly:\n\nPolitical environment\n\nThe Asian countries are embarking on measures to become politically neutral; this is necessitated by its role in international trade. The political environment is likely to benefit the company in that it will have access to national and international countries trading with the Asian countries.\n\nEconomical environment\n\nThe Asian countries are undergoing rapid economic development facilitated with international trade; the economic situation will offer good market to the company’s products. When a country is expanding, a number of companies producing goods and services who will require the products of the company; this will result to an increase in demand of the countries products.\n\nThe growth rate of the economy of Asian countries particularly China and Indonesia have for the last three decades, remained on a positive note. There have even been some rates recorded as high as 12% this is an element to show the strength of the economy as well as it gives us the hope of continuity in the market. The rate of growth is another indicator of a stable political environment that encourages local and international investors to invest.\n\nAsian countries have well developed financial sector with the privatized and government participation in the sector. The banks are stable enough to sustain the growing economy. On the other hand, although this may not have a direct impact on our business there is the emergence of micro finance institutions in the country, the institutions are giving a lot of support to the small-scale trader evident in the country; the growth of small traders will benefit the company, as they are source of market.\n\nThinking of the economy from that angle, it means that the manufacturing businesses will eventually benefit. Insurance companies are also a backbone of investment sector of an economy the insurance companies are stable enough and can handle big losses without going. At the same time, there are reinvestment insurance companies that help in maintaining stability even further. The banking sector has enabled firms to get loans at favourable rates.\n\nChina and Indonesia have highly modern developed infrastructures; these are both of transport and those of communication. The systems are advanced so well that access to the country from any corner of the world is highly enhanced; the airports, the seaport, and internal transport are well managed and accessible. The efficient transport will help in transportation of both raw material and finished carpets to and from various markets (Mitlez, 2004).\n\nEcological\n\nAsian countries have recognized the need for an environmental friendly production; the demands by the countries are likely to affect the company negative since it aims to produce non-green products.\n\nTechnological\n\nThe Asian countries are among the countries that have the most advanced technology. Mitlez, 2004 in his book Technology and Culture notes that the countries that is doing well in the technological innovation. It is developing its own technology as well embracing imported technologies. High technology assist in reduction of cost of production; this means that a business in China is more likely to produce quality and quantity at a very low price compared to other places in the world.\n\nLegal\n\nThe country has well framed business laws that Eastvaco has no option other than abide; this offers no threat since the country has measures to encourage foreign investments (Peter, 2006).\n\nStrength and weaknesses of Eastvaco\n\nStrengths\n\nEastvaco strengths are ventured in the company’s strong brand name that is internationally recognized. There is a wide recognition of these products in all parts of the world. The strength of the company is undoubtedly be engineered by its internal managerial mechanisms.\n\nIn order to have a competitive edge in selling its product and services, it will be advisable for the company to take advantage of its ability to compete favourably with equal players in the market. A strategic marketing plan is the only way out. The company has the financial strength to expand internationally; it will also benefit from a pool of knowledge that it has from experienced human resource team.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nEastvaco has two major weaknesses when venturing the market: the choice of products and managerial understanding of Asian market dynamics. The company has chosen non-green products; this is discouraged by Asian countries environmental policies, it thus will have to incur extra costs in the form of environmental damage taxes. The management have limited knowledge about Asian market dynamics thus; they are likely to make inferior decisions compared to its competitors, this will lead to loss of competitiveness (Paley, 1999).\n\nConclusion and recommendations\n\nEastvaco has the potential to diversify its activities and tap the fast growing Asian market. It has the financial capabilities. Asian countries strong financial institutions will offer the company adequate finances for its expansions. Eastvaco management should develop appropriate foreign market entry strategies and have an international marketing strategy so that it can compete effectively with other players in the market.\n\nReferences\n\nMitlez, S.

      "Response about Landscape and Narrative by Barry Lopez Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nAs the title illustrates, ‘Landscape and Narrative’ by Barry Lopez illustrates the relationship between the landscape and a narrative. The author illustrates that a narrative serves its purpose if it manages to illustrate the relationship between the interior and the exterior landscape effectively and in an orderly manner.\n\nThe exterior landscape represents the earth and the ecosystem while the interior landscape represents the mind, thoughts and everything that happens in a person’s mind. Therefore, it is clear that Lopez uses the issue of landscape to illustrate the role of a narrative as well as the points that ought to be considered to come up with an effective narrative.\n\nLopez illustrates that a narrator should have knowledge on the interior and exterior landscape to come up with an effective narrative. Since the exterior landscape represents the land, a narrator is supposed to have a lot of knowledge on the same to be in a position to effectively provide the relationship between the two landscapes. However, since it is not possible to have full knowledge on the land or the exterior landscape, observing the relationship between different elements can be very helpful.\n\nMost importantly, the author illustrates that full knowledge can only be realized if all the elements are studied together not separately. For instance, in an organization, there are different departments and the importance of each department can only be understood if someone studies how the whole system works. By so doing, the narrator is able to represent the exterior environment in such a way that the reader can identify with it and believe the narrator.\n\nApart from that, the way it is presented is also a consideration as well as the phrases used since it is important to ensure that all readers at all levels can be in a position to grasp the main idea and understand the content. In that case, Lopez has succeeded in illustrating how a story can be informative since it is a main prerequisite of an effective narrative.\n\nThe role of a narrative is also a major idea that is brought out throughout the whole story. Lopez illustrates that a well organized story that unites the two landscapes is able to result to a state of well being since it is stated that “ The listener who takes the story to heart will feel pervasive sense of congruence within himself and also in the world “(Lopez pp. 44).\n\nTherefore, according to Lopez, a well written story has got the power of healing and even nurturing the spirit of human beings after uniting the interior and the exterior landscape. Moreover, it provides individuals with knowledge concerning various elements in the land through studying their relationship as illustrated by the narrator.\n\nLopez uses the example of a narrative to illustrate the constituents of an effective narrative as well as the eventual roles played by the same. Use of the wolverine stories is very effective since by so doing, the reader grasps the intent of the author without major difficulties.\n\nMoreover, the story also illustrates the power of presenting information of the exterior environment in an orderly manner and in a way that the reader can identify with the elements of the land. As a result, the author is able to believe the narrator and to take the information as truth. As an example, Lopez explains that after sending the information about the wolverine to a friend, she got a positive response though the friend had never seen the creatures.\n\nTherefore, although Lopez does not concentrate so much on presentation, she has made a major contribution in illustrating not only the role, but also the constituents of `the story. In conclusion, Lopez states that “As long as the storyteller carefully describes the order before him, and uses his story telling skill to heighten and emphasize certain relationships, it is even possible for the story to be more successful than the story teller himself is able to imagine” (Lopez pp. 146).\n\nWork Cited\n\nLopez, Barry.

      "Latin American National Culture vs. Political Domination Essay\n\nThe Latin American culture has been forming in the course of several centuries. It was revealed through preservation of cultural traditions and vigorous fighting against natural and cultural suppression by different invasions and stiff political regiment.\n\nToday’s Latin America is now reaping the fruits of the previous events, beginning the Spanish conquistadors’ intrusion to twentieth century’s literature that exploded after political and economic “boom” in 60s. Despite a considerable span of time, the novels and books are still closely connected with describing eternal discrepancies between cultural stereotypes that has been carefully forged and political regimes established in that.\n\nLooking through the short stories, one tendency can be noticed: most of them are dedicated to cultural biases being so firmly established that they hampered the formation of stable political power deprived of tolerance and democracy (Echevarria, 3). Regarding the above-mentioned, successfully formed national culture hampered the establishment of enduring and stable systems of government due to inequality of human rights.\n\nThe gaps in political government are primarily predetermined by the long history of forging the national culture. This can be explicitly viewed in Fray Bartolome de la Casas’s short story called The Plague of Ants. The narration reveals the invasion of Spanish conquistadors that decimated the Indians for conquering the Island (de la Casas 39).\n\nIn this story, the write renders the ideas that only firmed cultural norms and faith triggered Spaniard to stop. More importantly, he proves that neither government nor human power is able to stop the destruction. While supplementing the religious notes to this narration, Bartolome de la Casas makes an attempt at disclosing the role of faith the main underpinning of social relations where politics and government are the least significant:\n\nNo Christian can doubt that, although God by his secret judgments might have permitted afflicting these peoples in this way and with such inhumanity, and in short, putting an end to them…those who were ministers of such harshness and caused the loss of so many souls, will be severely punished by divine justice (de la Casas 40).\n\nAs depicted in the narration, the revival of the Catholic faith has been the necessity to reconcile people’s blind desire to possess power. Over the century, the faith and in religions play a significant role in improving social standards.\n\nIt was the most efficient means for controlling the political power and establishing political justice (Hewitt 240). The same is presented in Leopoldo Lugones’s short story Yzur. The story can considered allegoric because training the monkey with severe method can be compared with imposing political power and reforms a people whose national culture contradicts these principles.\n\nThe author intends to say that instable and severe method of control and power can destroy human traditions and customs through establishment of despotism and terror. By suppressing the veritable ethical and cultural considerations, the outcome can be horrifying: “I woke up frightened. The monkey, which his eyes open; was definitely dying now, an his expression was so human, that it horrified me; but his hand, his eyes, drew me strongly towards him” (Lugones n. p.).\n\nThe confrontation of culture and politics is explicitly revealed in Ewell’s narration entitled The Blond with the Revolver where the writer sheds light on the gap cultural stereotypes and political needs of social groups. The story reveals the heroine’s fighting with the perpetuated conceptions of shame and honor.\n\nThe author argues the necessity to declare gender equality and the women’s right to defend their honor and dignity (Ewell 206). As a proof of unjust attitude towards women, the writer depicts the way politics utilize established customs in favor of the patriarch system where women can hardly express their opinion and participate in political events.\n\nThe impossibility to act independently due to constant suppression of women’s rights has hampered Lidia from self-realization and self-development. Taking advantage of the national culture and traditions, the political life in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, has triggered the rise of vivid movements of women’s organizations fighting for political participation in country’s governing (Ewell 209).\n\nBy giving exaggerating significance to class, age, and gender stereotypes made women be apart from political and social life of the country. This specifically concerns Maria Ferreira dos Santos, a political activist woman who had to overcome cultural biases to demonstrate her great potential and leadership skills. However, she managed to overcome those restrictions instead putting forward her veritable beliefs (Hewitt 245).\n\nLooking though the history of cultural and political formation of Latin American, one can pursue considerable discrepancies between national cultural and political frameworks. In particular, the shortcoming of established age, gender and social stereotyped were overused by the political power to control and suppress the population.\n\nIn this respect, it was really hard to meet the social and cultural needs of people and nation. However, religion and faith play a much greater role in altering the political views on governing. Looking through the above presented narrations and short stories, it is possible to state that culture and religions, but not social and political belief, were the trigger in establishing control and power. In this regard, political control and power were based on human inequality, gender and age biases.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDe la Casas, Fray Bartolome. The Plague of Ants.

      "Technology and Science: A Look Back at the Past Experiences Report (Assessment)\n\nTechnologies can hardly be defined as merely tools; instead, they can be evaluated on their own merits, as the indicators of the progress of the civilization and the measure of people’s possibilities in terms of science and progress.\n\nDespite the fact that, for the most part, technologies are supposed to be used as a tool for acquiring certain information or getting a specific result, they can also be introduced as a measure of progress, seeing how these technologies evolved over time. Indeed, it is noteworthy that over time, different tools have been used for the same purposes; for example, to distribute information on long distances, people used first pigeon service, then postal service, then phones; now people use Internet for this purpose.\n\nThus, technologies show how the humankind has evolved and can be considered a means to define the current stage of development. That being said, it would be wrong to assume that the only relation between technology and science can be defined as the one between theory and tools. Instead, technology is related to science as a measure of progress.\n\nMaking mistakes is an integral part of being human. To try new experiences and realize whether the theories that have been constructed in the process work, people have to take certain steps, which not always result in success. Therefore, failure is an inevitable and nonetheless important part of growth. However, making mistakes without learning from them does not lead to efficient growth; instead, it triggers even more problems.\n\nThus, it is crucial to learn to analyze the past mistakes, as well as the steps that triggered them. Once learning the factors that predetermined the failure, along with the point at which a mistake was made, one can drive important lessons even from the most deplorable experiences in human history. Related to technology, such experiences include the use of nuclear weapons in the WWII – or, to be more exact, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nIt would be wrong to call the invention of a nuclear bomb a mistake, though; to be able to define their moral dimensions, people have to know what is wrong and what is right, which means that people must not hide from the issues that are traditionally considered wrong. Instead, it is important to be able to define the point at which technology stops serving humankind and starts being used against it.\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about technology is that it affects not only science, but also a number of other fields, including economy, politics, and finances.\n\nIn a way, technology defines the way in which these fields evolve. With regard to economy, technology can be considered a powerful means to boost growth and provide the means to evolve. For instance, the concept of solar energy, which might soon become a part of everyday reality, is bound to shape economy considerably, seeing how it will reinvent the transportation system.\n\nWith the use of solar energy, the need in petrol is going to drop, which means that the current oil tycoons are going to be out of business. Thus, major oil companies will lose their control over the transportation market; as a result, the redivision of the world market is most likely to happen, with the re-definition of the companies that have the major influence on the world market.\n",
      "Mineral and Water Function Expository Essay\n\nMinerals and water play vital roles in the body. Lack of minerals and water in the human diet may result into serious health problems. According to Grosvenor and Smolin (2012), the body depends on the food taken in order to obtain minerals. Water is always obtained when one drinks water or from the foods taken. The most common and essential minerals needed in the body include calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium and zinc.\n\nCalcium helps in strengthening of teeth and body muscles. This mineral can be obtained mainly from milk products. Iron helps in distribution of oxygen in the body and can be obtained from meat, fish, liver and some chicken products. Magnesium is crucial in formation of bones and general workability of the nerves. Potassium balances the body fluids while zinc is necessary for growth and development. These minerals can mainly be obtained from vegetables and animal products.\n\nStanfield (2010) points out that just like the minerals mentioned above, water also plays a very important role in the body. This researcher explains that 90% of the body is composed of water. The body obtains a given percentage of water from foods taken, and through direct intake by an individual.\n\nAccording to Grosvenor and Smolin (2012), one of the main functions of water is to regulate the body temperatures. Many enzymes in the body work at given temperatures and therefore water ensures that such temperatures are attained for the enzyme-controlled processes to take place. Besides, water acts as a coolant, especially through perspiration. In addition, it acts as a lubricant, especially in the joints of the body.\n\nIts presence in the saliva in the mouth during chewing helps to avoid shock or damage emanating from friction of the joints. Stanfield (2010) says that without water, nutrients like proteins and carbohydrates cannot be absorbed in the body. In this case, water helps the chemical reactions that make these two nutrients become absorbable in the body. Therefore, water is crucial in the whole process of food digestion and transportation of food nutrients and oxygen in the body.\n\nThe above explained roles played by water show that it is one of the most important nutrients in the body. Lack of it may result into dehydration. As Stanfield (2010) points out, dehydration of the body poses serious impacts to an individual and can be life threatening. Some of the effects of severe dehydration include loss of general body weight, sight becoming dim, wrinkled skin, reduced urination, increased headaches and nausea, and weak immunity due to poor or no absorption of essential nutrients.\n\nDehydration makes all the important body processes come to a stop, greatly reducing the working ability of the body, a condition that is fatal. According to Grosvenor and Smolin (2012), incidences where the body is dehydrated should be avoided to avoid pre-mature deaths.\n\nThis can be done by drinking enough water. Although the body can generate water from some foods and fruits ingested, one should not rely on this as a source of water to the body. Stanfield (2010) recommends that one should take between 7 to 8 glasses of water a day or more when in exercise to avoid incidences that may lead to great water loss in the body. This would help one remain healthy and strong.\n\nReferences\n\nGrosvenor, M. B., & Smolin, L. A. (2012). Visualizing Nutrition: Everyday choices . Hoboken: John Wiley.\n\nStanfield, P. (2010).

      "“A Sweet Devouring” by Eudora Welty analysis. Essay\n\nThe story “A Sweet Devouring” by Eudora Welty is written in a semi humorous but also serious tone. The title suggests that there will be a degree of sweetness, although the noun “devour” creates a confusing effect, making the reader think that not everything is as simple as it seems. In the beginning of the story, the author mentions that it was her wish to hear that the family was less fortunate, instead of that they were doing well.\n\nRight away, this is a contradiction because how can a small child want for the family to have little money and status when everyone wishes quite the opposite. This suggests that there is some further sense to such wishing and the reader starts to wonder if it will be tragic or comic. The immediate connection to the book makes one think that maybe a girl wants to follow after some character from a book that she has read.\n\nThe fact that her mother would refuse to tell her, also says a lot about the true matter of things. Usually, a mother would explain the situation to their children. In case they were poor, she could say that they have other valuable qualities, doing fine or simply explain that “poor” is not an appropriate word and they are simply not as wealthy as some people are.\n\nIn case they were rich, the mother could have been more careful in explaining that having money or luxury does not mean that it should be talked about and used as a privilege. The fact that a child’s mother did not explain this, supposes that there was a certain type of relationship in the family where the mother was single, as there is no mention of the father or that they were going through a really rough time.\n\nThe way how the little girl talks about reading books, doing it constantly and with great appetite, means that there is not much she is involved in, except being at home and reading books.\n\nThis makes the reader wonder why she does not play with other children or have toys at home to keep busy with. Also, when the girl finishes all books and a later referral that she never knew about the existence of Series, proves that the amount of books their house had was not significant, if a nine year old child could read through them without satisfying her reading wants.\n\nAnother link is made to a story where the children were “unhappy” in any circumstance and the author accents on the fact that while she was reading the book, she did not realize the whole depth of sense that was being made. And again, the reference to a story of a girl who had shoes with holes. The author goes on to say that her mother finally took her to the library where the child found all sort of books and did not even care what kind they were, she just loved reading.\n\nWhen the girl mentions how the librarian would not let children through, it raises concerns as to the understanding and kind nature that librarian might have not had. This gets confirmed when the author sarcastically states that the librarian was there by choice but at the same time did not exhibit the qualities she should have had. The final reference to the child’s thinness completes the obvious theme and there is no doubt about true matter of things.\n\nThe author of the story clearly intended it to mean something that was not as obvious in the beginning of the paper. Using the details that were given throughout, the reader realizes the main theme the writer had in mind.\n",
      "Flexible Firms: The Case of Google Report\n\nIn recent years, many organisations have witnessed a shift from the traditional nine-to-five work paradigm to flexible work arrangements in a bid to sustain competitiveness, attract the best talent, and remain relevant to the needs of employees (Giannikis & Mihail 2011).\n\nThe shift towards flexible work practices is not surprising, given the many benefits that can be realized by affording employees control over when, where, or how much they work to achieve the aims and objectives set by the organisation (Leslie et al 2012). Indeed, workplace flexibility is heralded as one of the basic requirements in modern-day workplace (Hill et al 2008). The present paper uses the Google Corporation to critically discuss the concept of flexible firm and its relevance to the organisation.\n\nUnderstanding Flexibility\n\nAlthough workplace flexibility is often an inadequately understood and ambiguously defined concept despite its extensive usage by scholars and organisational practitioners (Eaton 2003), the present paper adopts a definition given by Hill et al (2008, p. 149), which conceptualises the notion to imply “the ability of workers to make choices influencing when, where, and for how long they engage on work-related tasks.”\n\nThese authors further posit that workplace flexibility is conceptualised in two divergent ways – the organisational perspective and the worker perspective.\n\nConsequently, from the organisational perspective, workplace flexibility is viewed as the degree to which organisational characteristics integrate a level of flexibility through the use of approaches such as ‘just in time’ production systems, contingent workers as opposed to permanent full-time employees, compressed work schedules and job rotation practices, with the view to allowing organisations adopt to shifts in their environment (Banfield & Kay 2008; Hill et al 2008). Google does not employ this perspective to define its flexibility programs.\n\nFrom the worker perspective, workplace flexibility is implicitly or explicitly conceptualised “as the degree to which workers are able to make choices to arrange core aspects of their professional lives, particularly regarding where, when, and for how long work is performed” (Hill et al 2008, p. 51).\n\nGoogle uses this approach in its engagement with employees by strictly internalizing the assumption that employees are human resources, whole individuals with essential life requirements outside of work and hence must be provided with flexible work practices not only to enable them achieve a perfect balance between work and life responsibilities, but also to spur motivation, loyalty and innovative behaviours (Griffin & Moorehead 2009).\n\nFlexibility for Competitive Advantage & Work-Life Balance\n\nFlexible work practices are increasingly becoming important to global organisations such as Google, as they enable them to achieve and sustain competitive advantage by attracting and retaining talented employees, minimizing stress and burnout, reducing turnover and absenteeism rates, increasing job satisfaction and organisational commitment, as well as improving productivity and morale (Torrington et al 2008; Giannikis & Mihail 2011).\n\nThe telecommuting policy practiced by Google, for instance, enables employees to experience few interruptions and also to tailor their environmental contexts to meet idiosyncratic preferences that enhance their motivation, commitment and productivity (Griffin & Moorehead 2009).\n\nAdditionally, owing to flexible work arrangements, Google employees are able to adapt their hours to meet the business requirements set by management and also to work at times of the day when they are most productive in line with the “happy worker theory.”\n\nHowever, according to the signalling theory, managers may interpret the use of flexible work practices as a signal by employees that they are engaged in personal life responsibilities that curtail their motivation and commitment toward their organisation (Leslie et al 2012).\n\nExtant literature demonstrates that “more women are entering the workforce, and the transition from single-income families to dual-career families has raised the challenge of achieving not only work-family balance, but also work-life balance” (Giannikis & Mihail 2011, p. 417). Google has made part-time work and compressed work-week available to its employees in order to adequately meet work and family demands (Griffin & Moorehead 2009).\n\nThis is in line with the ecological systems theory, which hypothesises that “the individual is best understood in the context of the interaction between the characteristics of the person and his or her environment” (Hill et al 2008, p. 154). In the context of work-life research, the most fundamental microsystems for employees include the home, place of employment, and the community.\n\nConsequently, it can be argued that Google is able to provide a work-life paradigm that ensures employees have access to the three domains that represent the mesosystems in the ecological systems theory, hence triggering productivity and organisational commitment while at the same time reducing work/family related stress and burnout (Griffin & Moorehead 2009). This orientation generates positive results for Google employees, their families, and the organisation.\n\nForms of Flexibility\n\nFlexible work options are numerous and can be classified into four groups: (1) flexibility in the scheduling of work hours – flex-time, compressed workweek and shift arrangements, (2) flexibility in the number of hours worked – part time and job sharing, (3) flexibility in the place of work – working at home and at a satellite location, and (4) flexibility in leave arrangements – parental leave, special leave and unpaid leave (Torrington et al 2008; Giannikis & Mihail 2011). Google exercises flexibility in the place of work and flexibility in the scheduling of work hours by allowing their employees to telecommute.\n\nAlthough the work of software programmers may be extremely demanding, Google ensures that its software developers do not suffer from stress and burnout by allowing flexible work arrangements (Griffin & Moorehead 2009). Google also provides its employees with fully paid maternity and parental leave, vacation days and holidays, day-time child care at Google Child Care Centre and other back-up child care centres, and free shuttle service (Schneider 2013).\n\nCulture\n\nAs is the case in Google, flexible work programs have the capacity to build an innovative, creative and high-performance organisational culture which, according to Banfield and Kay (2008), is critical in ensuring the continued growth of the company as well as the enrichment of employees’ work- and family-related experiences. Flexibility also brings diversity of ideas and ensures that people do not resist change.\n\nPartnerships & Location Outsourcing\n\nWith over 12,000 employees in offices throughout the world (Schneider 2013), Google is engaged in developing partnerships and location outsourcing not only in the United States, but also globally.\n\nIn partnerships, Google often engages expert global companies and professionals in partnerships to further its business objectives. The partners are provided with portable means to complete their job-related tasks and the freedom to choose which work-related environmental contexts would best satisfy business and personal/family requirements.\n\nIn its engagement with location outsourcing, Google is keen to contract companies that allow workers in diverse locations throughout the world to choose where work-related tasks are completed provided they meet the targets set by the company. This is often achieved through adopting flexplace practices as well as telecommuting (Griffin & Moorehead 2009).\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing Google Corporation as a case scenario, this paper has effectively addressed the concept of flexible firms and the benefits of adopting and implementing flexible work arrangements in organisational settings. Moving forward, it is clear that organisations need to implement flexibility programs not only to gain competitive advantage, but also to ensure employees remain productive and committed to the course of the organisation while still affording adequate time to be with their families.\n\nReference List\n\nBanfield, P & Kay, R 2008, Introduction to human resource management , Oxford University Press, Oxford.\n\nEaton, SC 2003, “If you can use them: flexibility policies, organizational commitment, and perceived performance”, Industrial Relations , vol. 42 no. 2, pp. 145-167.\n\nGiannikis, SK & Mihail, DM 2011, “Flexible work arrangements in Greece: A study of employee perceptions”, The International Journal of Human Resource Management , vol. 22 no. 2, pp. 417-432.\n\nGriffin, RW & Moorehead, G 2009, Organisational behaviour: Managing people and organisation , Cengage Learning, Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nHill, EJ, Grzywacz, JG, Allen, S, Blanchard, VL, Matz-Costa, C, Shulkin, S & Pitt-Catsouples, M 2008, “Defining and conceptualizing workplace flexibility”, Community, Work & Family , vol. 11 no. 2, pp. 149-163.\n\nLeslie, LM, Park, TY & Mehng, SA 2012, “Flexible work practices: A source of career premiums or penalties”, Academy of Management Journal , vol. 55 no. 6, pp. 1407-1428.\n\nSchneider, L 2013, Google: Company, culture and history , < https://www.thebalancecareers.com/google-overview-company-culture-and-history-2071320 >\n\nTorrington, D, Hall, L & Taylor, S 2008, Human resource management, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.\n",
      "Critical Thinking: Knowledge and Understanding Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Socrates\n 3. David Foster Wallace\n 4. Education as Maturity\n 5. The Matrix\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nKnowledge and understanding are two ways through which humans gain information and experiences about life. By gaining information and experiences, a person accumulates wealth of knowledge, while understanding enhances rational utilization of information and experiences.\n\nHence, it suffices to say that knowledge is necessary because people require information and experiences for them to utilize their lives and environment optimally for the benefit of humanity. Likewise, understanding is essential for people to formulate theories and concepts about their lives and environment. Thus, by definition, knowledge is the amount of theoretical information and empirical skills that one gains through education and experiences of life.\n\nIn contrast, understanding is the ability of a person to conceptualize information and experiences rationally. Since both knowledge and understanding are important in learning, philosophers have differed as to which is the preferable way of learning or thinking. Therefore, based on the reading, thinking, and writing, this essay argues that the preferable form of critical thinking is the understanding because it allows people to conceptualize things rationally.\n\nSocrates\n\nUnderstanding is the preferable way of thinking because it helps people to rationalize and conceptualize what they perceive in their environment. In the Allegory of the Cave, Socrates describes how the prisoners have knowledge about what they see yet they do not understand how shadows appear on the wall (Cohen 1).\n\nSince prisoners have lived in the cave for a long time, they have gained enough information and experiences about shadows that they see on the wall. Despite the fact that they have enough knowledge about their cave, they are unable to differentiate real images from shadows because they do not understand how that how they occur. Hence, lack of understanding makes the prisoners unable to conceptualize what they see on the walls.\n\nAlthough the prisoners can identify activities that the shadows on the wall perform, they do not understand how puppeteers generate them. The prisoners can identify activities that shadows perform such as walking across the wall, carrying luggage, and doing construction (Cohen 1). The prisoners are right in identifying the activities for they have knowledge; however, they do not understand that they perceive shadows as real images.\n\nAccording to Socrates, the prisoners have knowledge about different forms of human activities because they can attribute all images that they see on the wall to certain objects or activities. Through experience, the prisoners have learned that the images on the wall depict people when performing different activities. However, they fail to understand that they perceive shadows of real activities taking place behind the scenes.\n\nDavid Foster Wallace\n\nAccording to Wallace, knowledge does not provide an effective way of learning or critical thinking because it increases ignorance and delusion (8). For one to gain knowledge, one must collect information and derive meaning from it. Hence, the process of reading and deriving information eventually results in confusion and ambiguity.\n\nToo much knowledge without understanding of how it occurs increases ignorance and delusion. In essence, knowledge does not support critical thinking because one collects massive information, which ultimately confuses and increases ignorance. Essentially, the process of gaining knowledge is a passive one because one literally takes face value of the available information without considering whether it is real or imaginary.\n\nThe amount of knowledge that people have gained over a long period signifies the extent of their ignorance since they rely on information without necessarily reflecting on its importance. Wallace also asserts that getting informed and increasing literacy enhance stupidity as they make one to over-rely on the information (8).\n\nIn spite of the fact that knowledge enhances the intellectual capacity of the people, it deprives them of the ability to think critically about the information that they have amassed. Contrastingly, understanding enables people to use their basic knowledge about a given phenomenon in conceptualizing ideas and theories. Thus, understanding is the preferable form of critical thinking and learning.\n\nEducation as Maturity\n\nKnowledge gained through education enables people to mature and comprehend the essence of life. In the Education as Maturity, Overstreet states that a born baby is very ignorant, but he/she has an innate knowledge of suckling breasts (38). The innate knowledge emanates from the fact that a baby feels hungry and understands that suckling is a way of satisfying the hunger.\n\nMoreover, without knowledge, a baby can also register discomfort when exposed to temperature conditions such as cold or hot. This means that babies understand the environment and make appropriate responses for them to survive, despite having the limited knowledge possible.\n\nSince the creation of humanity, knowledge has increased tremendously because new fields of knowledge have emerged across centuries. In modern society, although different fields of knowledge exist, it is impossible for a person to be an expert in all the fields.\n\nSpecialization is relevant as it differentiates people according to their knowledge; however, understanding is necessary for people to appreciate the importance of knowledge in various fields. One can be a rocket scientist, but understands life as a gardener. In this perspective, education enables both the rocket scientist and gardener to mature in their perception of different fields of knowledge. Therefore, understanding is essential for one to comprehend different fields of knowledge.\n\nThe Matrix\n\nThe Matrix is a movie that depicts how people with knowledge live under an illusionary world where they exist in a simulated computer matrix. The computer matrix creates illusions that confuse and prevent people from perceiving the reality. Neo is the main character in the movie as he transitioned from the illusionary world to the real world.\n\nIn the movie, Neo is a computer hacker who has lived under illusionary world despite having such an enormous knowledge of computer programming. The knowledge of computer programming did not help Neo to understand that computer matrix was an illusion created by immense computer system. Hence, Neo lacked understanding for he failed to conceptualize that the matrix system was an illusion.\n\nHowever, when Neo swallowed the red pill, he exited the illusionary world and entered into the real world where he realized that the computer matrix system is an illusion. Before swallowing the red pill, Neo thought that the illusionary world of the matrix system was the real world.\n\nConsequently, after realizing that the matrix is an illusion, Neo began to learn many things about the real world. Therefore, the Matrix is a fictional movie that depicts illusion and reality as variables that are dependent on the understanding of a person. From this movie, it is evident that understanding is the preferable way of critical thinking and conceptualizing reality.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding is the preferable form critical thinking as it permits people to conceptualize what is happening in their lives and environment. The Allegory of the Cave effectively illustrates how prisoners have gained knowledge about their cave, yet they do not understand that they live under a delusion.\n\nAdditionally, other philosophers argue that too much knowledge and literacy deprives people of their critical thinking ability, and thus decrease their understanding. Therefore, understanding promotes critical thinking and enhances conceptualization of knowledge.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCohen, Marc. The Alegory of the Cave . 2006.

      "History of Women’s “Sexual Liberation” Essay\n\nToday, women have been able to create a discriminate position for themselves in a hitherto man dominant world. They have done wonders in various fields, like flying across the Atlantic, swimming across the English Channel, being part of the coveted Space Shuttle, being elected to the highest post in a government, etc. But this was not the case a few years back.\n\nWomen were oppressed and were not as privileged as they are today. The reforms in the condition of women can be stated to have started from the year 1968 onwards, when women were freed from the political and social restrictions and were allowed to vote on matters concerning the nation – in Switzerland.\n\nThis was the first step by women to traverse the social barricades. There was a subsequent uprising across the Western world where the role of women in the society was given a new dimension. This revolution is termed as ‘Sexual Liberation’. The word ‘sex’ should not be misinterpreted for the actual meaning but on the contrary, sexual liberation means a complete change in the perspective in which women were looked upon in the society; especially the Western society.\n\nThere is one organization that did splendid work towards creating an environment of equality for women’s in all fields. This organization was formed in 1966 and was called the National Organization for Women (NOW). ‘NOW’ tried its best to bring women into the mainstream of the society. During the years, more women came under the fold of ‘NOW’ and by the year 1978 its membership crossed the 100,000 mark.\n\nBut despite all the achievements and the work done by various organizations and individuals, there was still one area where women were still oppressed, and this was the work place. This was one place where women were not able to get their due reward or position. This happened because of a trend, called glass-ceiling, being followed in the corporate world.\n\nThe word “ceiling” depicts a kind of barrier for the progress of women and the word “glass” is used as an adjective for ceiling because as glass in invisible (transparent), the barrier is also invisible. This glass ceiling acted as a barrier for women to attain higher posts and higher salary slabs.\n\nBy the year 1980, the revolution that had started with a simple cause of attaining the right to vote, had taken a mammoth shape and it became a battle of recognition.\n\nFollowing is a brief time-line of important events pertaining to the sexual liberation that took place between 1968 and 1980:\n\n1968 – Miss America Beauty Pageant witnessed a protest from women. The reason for the protest was that the pageant portrayed women as objects of allurement and beauty.\n\n1971 – The concerned authority approved the bill pertaining to the equal rights for women.\n\n1972 – The bill was approved by the Senate as well and was validated and executed by the states. This was a big triumph for the women.\n\n1973 – Abortions were legalized during the judgment process of a case. This further boosted the morale of women.\n\n1973 – Anti rape laws came into being which defined rape as a criminal offence.\n\n1975 – In a typical rape case, the victim was discharged of charges of murdering the rapist. The murder was seen as an act of self-defence.\n\n1978 – The membership figures of the ‘NOW’ crossed the 100,000 mark.\n",

Overview of FedEx Corporation\n 4. Competiveness between US Postal Service and FedEx\n 5. Competitive strategies\n 6. References\n\nOverview of the USPS and FedEx\n\nThe contemporary economy provides both opportunities and challenges for the logistics companies in the United States and the entire world. Most companies are, therefore, coming up with competitive strategies that are meant to help them withstand the challenges, thus enhancing their competitiveness in the logistics sector.\n\nFedEx and the United States Postal Service (USPS) and FedEx are examples of companies that operate in the larger US logistics sector. The last two decades have witnessed a significant rise in cross border trade. This has been enabled by an increase in the number of shipments of goods from one region of the world to the other. Also, the volumes of trade within countries keep swelling, thus enhancing the significance of the companies that deal in delivery of goods to customers.\n\nOverview of US Postal Service\n\nThe USPS is a logistics company that deals in the provision postal services across the United States. The US Postal Service is a government owned agency that has dealt in the provision of postal services for over two centuries. The most unique feature between the US Postal Service and FedEx is the size of US Postal Service. The US Postal Service is the largest postal service company in the world. It should be noted that though it is government owned, the agency operates independently. With over a half a million employees and over a quarter a million fleet of vehicles, the company supplies and delivers mails across the entire United States.\n\nBeing the main government owned agency in the logistics sector in the United States, the main competitors for the company are private companies like FedEx. In order to enhance its capacity to deliver services, the US Postal Service contracts most of its activities to other companies. Contracting eases the competitive scale for the company, besides increasing efficiency in the discharge of services, particularly in business areas like overseas freighting in which the company is disadvantaged (Team, 2012).\n\nOverview of FedEx Corporation\n\nFedEx Corporation is a United States based global courier that delivers services across the United States. FedEx began its operations in the year 1971. However, the real stature of the company today is based on the developments in the company from the 1980s up to today, where the company made a series of acquisitions in order to gain the status it has today.\n\nFedEx is organized into diverse units, which makes it easy for the company to attend to diverse business operations. FedEx operates as an international carrier, unlike the US Postal Services that largely operates in the United States and contracts most of its foreign shipment services to other companies. At the beginning of this year, the company was listed in the Fortune Magazine as the most attractive companies for employees (Rushton & Walker, 2007).\n\nThis is a milestone for the company, considering the fact that in the past three years most companies have been implementing policies that entailed cutting the earnings of employees in order to factor the economic pressure in the production process and profitability of companies. The voluntary buyout that was opted for by the company amidst the challenging economic times was cited as one of the reasons why the FedEx came out as an outstanding company (Rushton & Walker, 2007).\n\nCompetiveness between US Postal Service and FedEx\n\nAs mentioned above, the current environment in the logistics sector is increasingly competitive, which implies that companies that are operating in the industry need to be vigilant and monitor the actions of other companies. Most analysts in the sector have been analyzing the trends in the sector and drawing analytical comparison between companies in the sector.\n\nThe timing of delivery and the prices that are charged on service delivery are the main areas in which there is a difference in operation between companies that operate in the US logistics sector (Rushton & Walker, 2007).\n\nCompetitive strategies\n\nThe nature of service offering by the US Postal Service and FedEx makes the two companies compete for the same customers. However, the clientele is quite large and diverse, which eases the scale of competition between the two companies. The customers for both companies are both individuals and corporate organizations.\n\nFedEx derives its business from the US Postal Service. Therefore, there is a complex relationship between the two companies since they both exert competitive pressure on each other, and at the same time partner in business.\n\nDue to the rise in competition in the industry, the level of corporate partnership between US Postal Service and FedEx has in the recent times become fragile. This comes from the fact that FedEx has been losing a lot of contracts with US Postal Service in the recent times to the upcoming competitors in the industry. Recent financial reports indicate that the US Postal Services has been seeking for new competitive bids for most of its contracts, including most of the contracts that are nearing expiry (Team, 2012).\n\nSince the year 2000, FedEx has been cited as the main contractor of US Postal Services. For the last ten years, FedEx has offered express mail delivery, first class mail delivery and priority mail service delivery.\n\nThe contemporary competition in the offer of the contracts for delivery of the services has presented a competitive threat to FedEx, which is forced to shift its attention to other business initiatives in order to mitigate the corporate effects of these changes. About 60% of the domestic revenue for FedEx now comes from the airfreight service delivery, showcasing the importance of the mail freighting service contracts it has had with US Postal Service (Rohrlich, 2012).\n\nLamb, Hair and McDaniel (2009) observed that one main difference between the two companies is that the US Postal Service has operated in the sector for a longer period of time than FedEx, which is considered as a company that is still coming up in as far as longevity of operation in the industry is concerned.\n\nHowever, this does not seem to bring about a lot of competitive difference between the two companies. Most people argue that this is a portrayal of the modern competition, which is mostly reflected in the application of short and long-term strategies by companies in a substantial number of industries.\n\nSince the two companies offer almost the same services, differentiation in the nature of service offering is the main competitive tactic that is utilized by the companies. As at the end of last year, the company came out as the lowest cost service provider in the industry. The US Postal Service does not charge extra fees on the services that are delivered on Saturdays.\n\nThis is a significant difference in competition with FedEx since customers take advantage of this service, especially with the rising cost of living that was necessitated by the economic turmoil that was witnessed at the end of the last decade. While the US Postal Service is seen as a reserved company, FedEx is considered as a more sophisticated company. This is characterized by the quality of services that are offered by FedEx (Roggio, 2011).\n\nTeam (2012) observed that FedEx has come up with a substantial number of initiatives to help it adjust to the recent competitive trends in the industry. The contemporary trend in the industry denotes that most of the companies in the US logistics sector are focusing on the low-cost delivery services.\n\nThis is a reflection of the trends in customer needs and demands in the sector. FedEx developed restructuring and cost cutting strategies. These strategies are aimed at helping the company enhance its capacity to serve its customers (Team, 2012). During the year 2012, the company cancelled the order kit it had made for four Boeing 777 planes with the order for smaller Boeing 767 planes. This move was aimed at cutting down the consumption of fuel, thereby raising the profitability of the company.\n\nUtilization of the large planes compounds the financial burden for the company during times when the demand for delivery services goes down. FedEx has a diversified supply chain and has kept diversifying its supply chain as a strategy of increasing its capability to offer services across the wider market (Rushton & Walker, 2007). FedEx has also been noted to consider adoption of e-commerce practices. This has been another source of the competitive strength of the company (Mukerjee, 2007).\n\nReferences\n\nLamb, C.

      "Discussing Production and Offshoring Essay\n\nBusiness must be one of the most fast-changing spheres; what used to be the key principle of running a business might prove completely inefficient in several years, and the recent innovations date within a millisecond. Taking a closer look at such parts of business process as production and offshoring will help understand what has changed over the past few years and what new tendencies have appeared.\n\nBefore going any further, one must define the key terms offered in the UNCTAD report. The first issue to deal with will be core business. According to the UNCTAD report, a core business is a set of activities that involve such stages as establishing a more effective internal division of labour, freeing scarce resources to be used in other segments of its value chain ( Non-equity modes of international production and development , 2011, 125).\n\nInterpreting the given definition, one can assume that core business is the kind of business that focuses on the key issues, i.e., labor, resources and losses/benefits that the owner of the business can possibly take on the way to conquering the existing market and attracting target customers. Moreover, the concept of a value chain should also be integrated into the given definition; therefore, promotion should be included in the basic set of activities.\n\nAnother important issue to be defined is global value chains. According to the definition provided by the UNCTAD report, global value chains are the mechanisms that offer an opportunity to “increasingly control and coordinate the operations of independent or, rather, loosely dependent partner firms, through various mechanisms” ( Non-equity modes of international production and development , 2011, 124).\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that global value chains are the methods that allow to promote a certain facility or product not only within the boundaries of a specific country, but also in other states (Van Dijk & Trienekens, 2012).\n\nBefore defining non-equity modes of entry, one should find out what a mode of entry actually means. According to the explanations provided by the UNISTAD report, a mode of entry is a method for a specific state to start trading relationships within the realm of global market ( Non-equity modes of international production and development , 2011, 157).\n\nAccording to the evidence offered in the above-mentioned source, one of the most widespread modes of entry is a franchise: “international franchising can be an avenue for brands from developing countries to grow internationally” ( Non-equity modes of international production and development , 2011, 157). Therefore, a non-equity mode of entry means entering a certain market with considerably fewer rights than the rest of the companies.\n\nFinally, such an issue as countervailing power of partners should be mentioned as a great chunk of international business relationships. As the UNCTAD report says, establishing the countervailing power of partners means that the partners in question are considered completely equal in a specified market.\n\nThe report mentions, naturally, that the case of fully matching powers is extremely rare; however, “partner companies in host countries possess or can develop ‘countervailing power’, often with the support of their government” ( Non-equity modes of international production and development , 2011, 129). Hence, it can be assumed that having a countervailing power in a specific market means having similar assets and equal opportunities for two or more companies.\n\nAt present, four basic types of Non-Equity Models, or NOMs, and each of these models has its own determinants that need to be described in order to get a full picture of the current business opportunities for overseas partners.\n\nContract manufacturing is, as the UNCTAD report claims, “Contractual relationships whereby an international firm contracts out to a host-country firm production, service or processing elements of its GVC (extending even to aspects of product development). All go under the general rubric of ‘outsourcing’” ( Non-equity modes of international production and development , 2011, 128). Therefore, it can be assumed that contract manufacturing is focused on outsourcing issues.\n\nAnother type of NOMs, franchising, in its turn, is defined as a “contractual relationship in which an international firm (franchisor) permits a host country firm (franchisee) to run a business modelled on the system developed by the franchisor in exchange for a fee or a mark-up on goods or services supplied by the franchisor” ( Non-equity modes of international production and development , 2011, 128). As for licensing, the given type of NOMs presupposes that the control over the enterprise is vested to a contractor (Newlands et al ., 2012).\n\nFinally, the contract farming model involves “contractual relationship between an international buyer and (associations of) host-country farmers (including through intermediaries), which establishes conditions for the farming and marketing of agricultural products” ( Non-equity modes of international production and development , 2011, 128).\n\nEven though each of the above-mentioned models seems quite important for business relationships and provides quite adequate approaches towards building these relationships with foreign partners, it is still important to remember that these models have their pros and cons. In terms of local value, the model that generates the highest one is the contract manufacturing, since it is based on the policy of outsourcing and, therefore, presupposes that the company has a flexible knowledge system that becomes stronger every day.\n\nThough offshoring is generally admitted to have positive effects on business relationships in general and on the U.S. economy in particular, it is necessary to mention that the success in offshoring came at a price. As Bivens explains, negative trade effects occur in the companies with high-skilled professionals producing export goods, e.g., software.\n\nThus, the USA loses to the export states. Another side effect of offshoring, the costs for distribution consequences, means that the employees will obtain considerably lower revenues than expected, as opposed to the company owners: “If the redistribution goes strictly to capital-owners, then workers are unambiguously worse off” (Bivens, n. d., 4).\n\nIn addition, according to Bivens, the assumption that offshoring will help reduce prices and unemployment rates is downright wrong, because it does not consider the downsides of price reduction, thinking of the benefits for the U.S. economy, instead: “The GI study is not actually measuring the effect of offshoring; rather, it is a prediction about how much rapid cost declines in IT services provision would benefit the U.S. economy” (Bivens, n. d., 7).\n\nTherefore, it can be considered that the phenomenon of offshoring is much more complicated than it seems. However, to reduce its negative effects, it will be reasonable to use its positive aspects to benefit the U.S. economy and at the same time incorporate a different approach that will level off the negative aspects of offshoring.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that there has been a great change in the process of production and development; one of the recent innovations, non-equity modes, can be considered a major breakthrough, yet the new ideas require testing.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of offshoring, which comes as one of the benefits of globalization, might seem the solution to most problems of the companies that face financial issues, yet it is important to keep in mind that the work should be distributed equally among the departments and affiliates of a specific company.\n\nReference List\n\nBivens, L.

      "Racism in the American Nation Term Paper\n\nAbstract\n\nEven though humanity is living at a time in history where virtually everything is possible, it is ironical that the society is still torn apart when it comes to dealing with crucial issues that affect them. These are issues that have a direct impact on the lives of part of or the whole humankind. In this paper, the writer will discuss racism as a major problem in the American nation. The paper will mostly dwell on the methods and principles that can be put into use in an effort to get rid of the vice.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRacism is a discriminatory practice against people from certain races or of a certain color. Racism can also be defined as the unfair practice of showing undue favor to a certain class of people and denying the same for other people who equally qualify to receive the same treatment either as citizens of the same country, students of the same school or members of the same organization. Racism is a common practice especially in places where there are mixed groups of people with diverse racial backgrounds.\n\nIn the United States of America, the word racism has been the talk of media and the general American population over and over again. Even though the national constitution clearly advocates for racial equality and acknowledgement and appreciation of racial differences, it is uncertain whether the same sentiments are engraved on the hearts of every American.\n\nWith the prohibition of racial segregation as far as social places and other amenities are concerned, one would be mistaken to think that the USA has come to a stage in its history where racism is totally inexistent.\n\nThe above statements may not be true if the experiences of the daily life of the minority races in America are taken into account. In the day to day life of such individuals, there comes a time they come face to face with racism. These are the times when the unnumbered Americans who are still racists at heart expose the same to them. As much as racism is a disgusting and can even be regarded as barbaric, the experiences that these people sometimes go through are tough and even at times humiliating.\n\nAs discussed above, this problem of racism mainly affects the minority races in the United States of America. The two most common races that have severely been subjected to racism are the African Americans and the Arab Americans. The proprietors of racism have their own reasons for treating such races in the manner that they do. For African Americans, the main obvious reason for their subjection to racial discrimination is the color of their skin and their ancestral background.\n\nThe black color of the African Americans has often evoked different reactions from white Americans when it comes to the issue of equality. It is a common behavior for the whites to feel more free while in the company of other whites than they do when in the company of blacks.\n\nThis is still happening to some extent in the present day although to a smaller scale compared to the seriousness of the situation a century ago. The type of racism that is rampant today is rather muted than blatant. It happens daily and to a good number of African Americans daily but it is never reported due to the fact that the subjects have learnt to live with it.\n\nWhite Americans are also prejudiced against the African Americans because of their ancestral background. The fact that the ancestors of the latter first came to the United States as slaves creates an impression of their inferiority. Those who practice racism still have the mentality that the whites were originally the masters of the African Americans and should still be treated with the same regard.\n\nOn the other hand, the Arab Americans are racially discriminated because of the history of war between the United States and the Arab countries and terrorist groups of Arab origin. The war between America and Iraq shaped the perspective of many Americans on the Arabs. The fight with terrorist groups such as the infamous Al-Qaeda has also been crucial in shaping the perspective of American whites on their fellow citizens of Arabic origin.\n\nThe 9/11 bomb attacks had a devastating effect on the relationship between Arab Americans and the white Americans. After this tragic historical event, most Americans regarded Arabs with hostility and disgust. This prejudice was caused by the wrongful association of every Arab with the terror attacks.\n\nAs much American legislators have done their best to ensure racial equality, chances are that this may never come to achievement as far as the relationship between white Americans and Arab Americans is concerned. And even though there may be a falsified outward portrayal of racial equality between these two races, it is certain that what lies on the inside is something totally different. In retaliation, the Arabs have also regarded the Americans as entirely immoral and unfair.\n\nThere is dire need for a solution to the problem of racism in the United States of America. According to the writer of this paper, this solution lies with a discipline of Psychology called Social Psychology. Social Psychology is a study that describes the influence of other people on a person’s thoughts, imaginations, behaviors and feelings. The fact that the human mind is prone to social influence gives hope of the total restoration of racial equality in the United States of America.\n\nSocial Psychology comprises of various theories that can be used to root out racism from the United States. These theories try to identify the exact causes of racism in America. By doing this, these theories or principles provide room for combat against this vice through efforts to get rid of the causes.\n\nThe first theory is the scapegoat theory. This theory suggests that people who are caught in certain unpleasant situations tend to find someone to blame it on. By doing this, the people find an outlet for channeling out their disappointment and distress which can lead to racism.\n\nA good example of the scapegoat theory at work is the blaming of the 9/11 terror attacks on the entire Arab community. This blame is obviously wrong because it is not based on anything, nor is there substantial evidence that proves this stance. Furthermore, it is impossible that every single Arab in the United States of America had a hand in the perpetration of the bombing. This is a mere method devised by American citizens who are racists to find an excuse for promoting racial discrimination and prejudice.\n\nAnother instance of the scapegoat theory is the blaming of the high rate of crimes in the United States on African Americans. The majority of criminals in America are of black origin. This has created an impression that a majority if not all blacks are terrorists.\n\nThis has even affected the line of duty of law enforcers as they are more stringent with African Americans than they are with the whites. This characteristic creates a situation where a large percentage of the American population is prejudiced against colored people, and most specifically, African Americans.\n\nThe second Social Psychology theory that can be used as a solution to racism is the us and them or in-group and out-group theory. In this theory, it is believed that each and every individual has the feeling of the need to belong. It speculates that human beings are a species that finds solidarity in grouping. However, it is through this grouping that conflicts and arguments arise between rival groups. This raises the need to stand for one’s group and defend it with all that one can afford.\n\nThrough the identification with a certain group, one tends to gradually come to like all the aspects of this particular group and hate everything about the rival groups. This is where prejudice and racism come in. When one develops a passionate dislike for such groups, it creates room for passionate racism. This is especially the case where the organizations or groups were formed on the basis of racial backgrounds. Efforts of promoting free constructive social interaction between such groups may prove equally futile.\n\nThe Just-world Phenomenon is yet another principle of Social Psychology that can be effectively used to put a stop to racism. In this phenomenon, the world is regarded as soundly fair in its dealings with people.\n\nThis theory holds that no one is to blame for the evil that may happen to a person. In the same manner, those who are more fortunate in life do not owe it to anybody but got the fortune from the very world that grants both good and bad. In a summary, this principle suggests that good people in life receive good things while bad people receive a share of misfortunes.\n\nThe Just-World Phenomenon justifies the discrimination of people basing on their racial backgrounds. The perpetrators of racism in this case say that they are not really the ones to blame for the existence of the minority races against which they discriminate. Since they don’t take any responsibility for the dark color of anyone’s skin, they actually have no problem if they relate with them differently from the way they relate with each other.\n\nAnother theory of Social Psychology that can be used to get rid of racism is the principle of social inequalities. According to this principle, the discrepancy in the possession of valuables in life creates strata in society that are used to gauge the suitability of individuals in the society.\n\nThis theory explains that the rich, who are commonly referred to as the “haves” are prominent and respected members of the society and have a great deal of influence on matters in the society. On the contrary, the people who are less endowed with wealth, commonly referred to as the “have-nots” are usually treated with less attention and are subject to discrimination.\n\nMost of the members of the minority races are not so rich. This is either because they are mere immigrants with a minimal fortune or that they had a poor ancestral background. This makes them victims of racism on the basis of their monetary possessions. This was the situation that faced a majority of African Americans many years back but it has taken a positive turn in the twenty first century.\n\nThe above Social Psychology theories and principles are the most effective tools that can ever be used to stop racism because they identify factors that lead to the vice. Through a careful address of these factors, there is a possibility that racism can be part of history in the United States of America. If the government and other concerned organizations put special emphasis on the above named theories and principles, the writer is positive that America will be free from racism in just a matter of months.\n\nThe problem of racism in the United States of America developed as a result of a high rate of immigration into the nation. Today, the Native American population accounts for less than fifty percent of the total population. Because America is made up of a wide range of races and cultures, there are higher chances of racism and cultural bias. Therefore, the major cause of racism in the United States is the generalization of a variety of races under one nation (Heriot, 2003).\n\nRacism in the United States of America has been the cause of political debates, sluggish development of some areas and personal misunderstandings between individuals. For the above to be corrected, a solution for racism should be arrived at urgently. The writer also chose this topic or racism because it is the right of every American citizen to receive equal treatment and privileges just like others irrespective of the race or color.\n\nThis problem is also important because its solution will lead to the motivation of the American citizens who were previously victims of racism. They will receive a sense of belonging which will go a long way in renewing their dedication and loyalty to their service for the nation.\n\nThis will eventually translate into a faster economic growth because these people will restore their confidence in the nation. For instance, an Arabic business man won’t have to fear about the risk of loss because he will have confidence in the market that is free from racism.\n\nThe writer’s personal view of this problem is that it has no place in such a civilized and modernized society as America. Racism should be the last thing on the minds of any right-minded American citizen who truly loves his or her country.\n\nIf the United States of America is actually the home of the free as stated in the last stanza of the national anthem, then this freedom should not only be embraced and cherished on the outside only but should also come from deep inside the heart of each and every single American citizen. Each one should be granted the opportunity to enjoy the freedom that such a great nation can offer to its citizens without any racism or prejudice.\n\nThe writer also thinks that it is the responsibility of every American citizen to ensure that racism is wiped out of the face of the nation. This will only be done through a personal decision to treat all American citizens as equal in all aspects irrespective of their race. This type of solidarity will contribute greatly in the eradication of racism.\n\nAs it is with every similar situation, there are some people who stand to benefit from racism in the United States. These include political leaders from the victims of racism who have vested interests. These leaders want to appear as if they are fighting for the rights of their people when in actual sense they are buying time in order to continue enjoying the political support of the people.\n\nUnlike the views presented by the writer above, these political leaders believe that racism can only be eradicated through appropriate legislation. This is why they have been pushing for the enactment of bill after bill to reduce chances of racism. However, this method has so far failed. This is because the problem is in the people’s minds and not the laws.\n\nThe LSE Students’ Union has been on the forefront in campaigning against racism. One of the main strategies used by this union is the declaration of anti-racism days. They have also employed the use of street matches to persuade people to turn away from racism.\n\nThe writer would recommend that other teams should aim at getting more people to be aware of the positive effects of stopping racism. This can be done by printing pamphlets and posters urging them to get rid of racism and help build a strong nation of racial diversities. The other teams can also plan on submitting articles to the print media for publication. These will reach a larger population of people and increase the rate of emancipation of the masses from racism.\n\nThe writer’s team has done an incredible job in educating Americans about the necessity of dropping racism. The team has mainly focused on high schools. This is because they are the young people that are more likely to bring change to the society as opposed to the elderly who may find it hard adapting to new facts.\n\nApart from that, the team has been in a position to hold events such as seminars and conferences in a bid to campaign against racism. The team has so far received a positive response from the public. One important thing that the team does during these events is the collection of signatures from those who pledge to stop racism. If all the people honor their pledges, then the team has delivered thousands of persons from the chains of racism.\n\nIn addition to the above measures, the writer’s team has also set aside an outreach day on the first Saturday of every month to conduct door to door campaigns against racism. This has been the most effective tool in this campaign. The team is encouraged to carry on with this noble course every time people nod in appreciation and acceptance of the facts presented to them about racism.\n\nIn conclusion, racism is a rampant practice in the United States of America. The minority races are the ones that mostly fall victim to this vice. Furthermore, it is clear from the above discussion that Social Psychology is the most effective tool in fighting racism. However, there are also those people who benefit from racism and have slowed down its eradication. Finally, it is evident from the discussion that the writer’s team has done much in fighting racism.\n\nReference List\n\nHeriot, N. (2003).

References\n\nIntroduction: Description of the dispute\n\nJudicial review is a distinctive feature of constitutional law in the United States. This is The reason why the power held by federal courts to test federal and state legislative enactments and other actions can be overlooked by the supreme court which in most cases its faced by disagreements among the detractors and its supporters about its doctrines and its application.\n\nThe conduction of a presidential elections and declaring a winner is the most important decision to be made in a democratic state. As simple as it all sounds presidential election are complex processes.\n\nThe United States was a victim of the interesting interplay experienced between the executive and the judicial branches of government during the 2000 U.S. general elections.\n\nThis report describes and analyzes the role of judicial review in the outcome of the 2000 presidential results in America. The election results ended up being a court issue where the United States Supreme Court had to intervene and pronounced George W. Bush the winner even though the election was closely contested.\n\nIn this paper, I will seek to analyze the threat that was posed by the Bush V Gore case to the judicial procedures in this country whereby in the 2000 presidential elections provoked indifference between the running candidates and their supporters leading to a series of court procession to determine the outcome results. Americans turned out to take part in the elections through casting votes and following the vote the counting process.\n\nHowever this was disrupted by the dispute that erupted as vote counting process came to a close in the state of Florida. The principal problem during the 2000 American presidential elections was the manner in which the votes were counted since the election victory hung upon a terribly close margin and the most challenged fight for Florida’s 25 electoral votes. According to many experts like Thayer views, there was no uniformity standards employed while in counting the different types of ballots across the nations for years.\n\nThe nature of balloting during an election in United States varies from state to state across the nation. The variation could be in terms of the size of areas in geographical measures or the number of people who are eligible and registered voters. How an individual will cast the vote is entirely a process that is overseen by the local officials because most of the voting systems are paid for locally.\n\nThey oversee the kind of equipment to be used and the forms of ballots to be used. Absent ballots which had not been counted in some jurisdictions were left out once, it was determined there were fewer absentee ballots than the difference in the vote between the two leading candidates. According to the Electoral College system, a candidate who wins the elections is considered to “take-all”,having been allocated all votes he/she is declared the victor.\n\nOn November 7, 2000, after the completion of a nationwide count of ballot papers records showed that Al Gore was in the lead against his opponent Bush with a total of 266-246 of the electoral votes. The winning candidate had to garner 270 electoral votes. At that time Florida had not yet concluded its voting outcome for the 25 electoral votes due to machine counting error.\n\nBut thereafter as soon as the machine count was over Bush was leading despite the minimal margin that was present, about 100 votes. After declaring Bush as the victor of the elections, Gore requested a manual recount of the ballots to be conducted in certain counties in the state of Florida and his request was backed by a number of state officials who including Florida’s Attorney General Bob Butterworth who headed the Democrats’ campaigns in Florida.\n\nReasoning of the court in the case\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court then extended the deadline for completion of recounts as they ordered a recount of the votes through the manual method for all the ballots which counting machines had not recorded to having any presidential choice. The precise legal claim presented by Bush was that he sorts a stay from the Florida Supreme Court order permitting an electoral recount of the ballots for the presidential elections.\n\nThe electoral voting turnout declared Bush the winner over his counterpart by a very small margin. The results of the counts then saw Gore seeking the Florida Supreme Court to order a manual recount of the votes because of the “under votes”. After examining the arguments presented by Gore the Florida Supreme Court ordered a recount to be conducted across the state of Florida.\n\nThis decision led to Bush appealing the judgment passed by the Florida Supreme Court to the United States Supreme Court arguing that their decision was violating the federal statute which requires electors to have finalized all the works at hand before the meeting at the Electoral College commenced. He was being represented by Theodore Olson who claimed that recounting of the votes was violating an equal protection clause that is presented in the fourteenth amendment of the United States constitution.\n\nBugh (2010) notes “the main issue was the questionable votes cast those for democrats’ who may have been confused by how the balloting was being conducted” The procedure for voting involved punching a hole next to an individual preferred candidate a procedure which many Democrats’ supporters complained of having been confused with the name placement of the candidates forcing many to vote for the wrong candidate.\n\nOthers claimed to have had a problem as the machines failed to make a hole at the correct sport and hence they were only able to indent their choice. Apart from these there are those people who voted for more than one presidential candidate amidst the confusion, sparking more controversies as to whether or not a vote recount could be conducted.\n\nWhy the decision was Problematic\n\nOnce the issue was presented to the legal institutions, it brought into light the use of policy in solving matters involving judicial decision-making (Cannon, 2000). According to the courts, procedures governing the manual count did not satisfy the minimum requirement for no arbitrary treatment of voters a clause found under the Equal Protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court ordered a recount of the cast votes but the appeal of the case to U.S. Supreme Court verdict is that their decision is to overturn the decision taken by the Florida Supreme Court calling off the manual recounting of the votes.\n\nThis decision was the final rule by seven justices who pointed out the decision by the Florida Supreme Court to conduct a recount was an action that failed to observe the constitutional rights stating, “Because it is evident that any recount seeking to meet the Dec. 12 date will be unconstitutional … we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida ordering the recount to proceed”\n\nAccording to these justices, vote recounting in Florida did not meet the minimum requirement needed for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right to vote ( Bush v Gore , 121 S Ct 525, 530 (2000).\n\nJustification for using judicial review\n\nCourts are becoming major players in the political arena as demonstrated in the case Bush v. Gore. The intervention made by the United States Supreme Court in declaring the 2000 election victor made the institution become an object of political controversy. Those who opposed the decision ruled by the Supreme Court viewed the verdict as favoring one party, making the Court partisan.\n\nAccording to these people (opposers), the courts helped Bush ‘steal the election’ while those proposing that the court had done its best based their argument on the fact that they considered their ruling with the help of legal considerations.\n\nThe main problem following the ruling of the case was the dissatisfaction of both those in the political field opposing the verdict and the supporters of Al Gore. “Justices are sometimes accused of targeting their partisan and ideological foes that makes them more liable to strike down laws passed by bipartisan majorities as by ideologically distant majorities” (Bugh 2010).\n\nAnother problem arising from the ruling of the case Bush v Gore was that the verdict suggested that the court was motivated by a particular kind of partisanship. A kind of which could not even be compared to the promotion of broad political principles through the development of constitutional doctrine.\n\nIn this case, it is clear that there is a difference between the commonly referred to as high politics played by political principle and the low politics of the partisan advantage. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bush 5-2 from voting that was carried out by justices who had before contributing to the revolutionizing of constitutional doctrines.\n\nHence it would be fair to note that during the case these justices were in a way obligated to promote a relatively consistent set of ideological positions which protected the state government process from being interfered with by the federal supervision. However the justices failed and instead they adopted whatever legal arguments they found favoring the Republican candidate George W. Bush. (Kelly 2003)\n\nAccording to Mark Graber’s reasoning, the twenty first century has brought about a number of changes in U.S Supreme Court’s justices. The Supreme Court justices announced constitutional limits on federal and state power by declaring federal and state laws unconstitutional. There are statements that are used by legal officials to restrain federal and states officials routinely “we hold that the act exceeds the authority of congress”, or “we hold that the congressional veto provision in &244(c) (2)… is unconstitutional (INS v Chadha 462 U.S. 919 959(1983) (Brooks 2000).\n\nThe Supreme Court is able to declare a law unconstitutional if the cases are involved in limiting federal authority. This is the same right found in opinions striking down laws that enjoy substantial popular support and in opinions striking down laws of interest only to a few specialists. The same opinion is embraced by both the liberal and conservative justices asserting “this law is unconstitutional” when imposing constitutional limits on government power.\n\nAs the establishment of judicial review commenced, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the Marshall Courts made it easier for judicial review to be implemented by separating the law from the politics. It was important for America to establish and implement judicial review in both legal and political terms.\n\nBefore, Supreme Court justices would have an influence over the political state of America only when influential members of the incumbent regime showed its support for judicial review. These political officials supporting judicial reviews would continue supporting it for as long as the policies decided upon were to the advantage of the influential political members. The establishment of judicial review sheds light on recent debates raised during strategic voting by justices. Marshall’s manner of voting was considered a strategic one.\n\nThe laws he thought were unconstitutional were sustained especially those that were perceived as being more aggressive in judicial action and would tend to damage the political foundations for judicial review. Judicial power can be explained as the ability to make an individual do something that they would otherwise not do.\n\nThere are several cases that can be used to provide evidence of such powerful practices over time. According to Brooks (1986), there are ways in which laws and politics are used in the structuring of the judicial decisions.\n\nDuring the 2000 elections the Supreme Court ended the most contentious presidential race by declaring Bush the winning candidate. The Democrats’ supporters accused the courts of having practiced partisan politics while the Republicans congratulated the courts efforts in following the rule of law.\n\nAmidst the controversies around the appointment of President Bush was the debate about judicial decision making process carried out by the Supreme Court. The main question was how the Supreme Court ended up making their decisions, did they base their decision on the constitution and the laws specified or did they base theory decisions on politics and policy references?\n\nThe Supreme Court violated some important principles and even circumvented federal law deciding the case. Courts are obligated to make decision on cases basing their preferences on the law and not policy preferences. This is the reason why many challenged the decision made in the case of Bush vs. Al Gore.\n\nIts intervention was clearly unprecedented and intruded upon the political processes in many aspects. Having halted the vote counting process the court is said to have prevented a democratic ending of a states’ most important decision. To many people the statement “ballots shall not be counted” as ruled by the courts was an ironical gesture, considering the fact that United States claims of being a state with special stature as a democracy.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe courts function in deciding which person is right and who is wrong basing their verdict on the states laws. Persons who have the authority to exercise the review power are obligated to ensure that the grantee believes that the grant extends to the arising occasion. Once the decision is wrong then the person is accountable to the grantor only unless a person is an authority paramount to both the grantee and the granter.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided to stop ongoing voting recount in Florida, with a 5-2 leading vote, the decision was therefore based on the fact that if vote counting would have been prolonged then the state of Florida had no chance of having their electoral votes counted since they were violating the federal statute and it would not be right to pass the verdict without challenging it in Congress under the Electoral Count Act.\n\nJustification of ending vote recount\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause is a guarantee to each person who votes that as a voter, ones ballot cannot be devalued. For this reason the verdict placed by the Florida Supreme Court was against the constitution of America. Recounting the votes would be considered by many critics a fair move in terms of theory but in terms of practice the process was unfair. Besides, the time to stop all ballot counting processes was almost over that is why the court held that there was no constitutional recount that could have been carried out in such a short time.\n\nThe court’s reasoning was that counties varied in their balloting procedures so conducting a manual recount of these cast votes would take longer than the stipulated time.\n\nIn actual sense the legislative council wanted to take advantage of the “Safe Harbor Act” provided in the United States constitution under section 5. The recount was also unconstitutional because the Florida Supreme Court’s decision made new election law which could only be carried out by the states legislature.\n\nLegal counsel experts, (Breyer, Souter, Rehnquist,Scalia and Thomas) agreed that vote recounting in Florida was unconstitutional since it violated the equal protection clause. They opposed basing their argument in respect to the remedy, believing that the decision taken could have been right if only it was stated clearly under a constitutional recount (Cannon 2000).\n\nTaking into consideration that the Equal Protection clause warrants individuals that their ballots cannot be diminished by “later arbitrary and disparate treatment,” the per curiam view argued that the Florida Supreme Court’s slate for recounting ballots was not constitutional – even if the recount was reasonable in theory, it was inequitable in practice.\n\nThe confirmation indicates that different standards were applied from ballot to ballot, area to area, and county to county. Due to those and other procedural ambiguities, the court ruled that no constitutional recount could be done within the short timeline (that was short since the Florida legislature desired to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provided by 3 USC Section 5).\n\nAbominate to make wide pattern, the per curiam view limited its holding to the present case with Rehnquist (in a concurring view together with Scalia and Thomas) perceived that the recount slate was also not constitutional since the Florida Supreme Court’s verdict made new election law that only the state legislature could pass.\n\nMany law experts concurred with the per curiam arguing that the Florida Court’s recount slate was in contravention with the Equal Protection Clause, but they disputed with respect to the remedy, judging that a constitutional recount could be bent and time could be insubstantial when constitutional liberties are at stake.\n\nGinsburg and Stevens suggested that because federal laws, the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment ought to stand. Furthermore, the Florida decision was essentially right; the Constitution required that all votes to be counted.\n\nCourts cannot justify their halting vote the counting process in Florida. From the perspective of several legal officials and critics cite the use of the equal protection clause could spark a new era whereby courts would use the clause as a way to get a solution to fundamental inequality issues during an election.The Supreme Court truly lacked jurisdiction to decide the case outcome. The reason being that all evidence presented were not enough to be used for making any decisions most especially because the case was in a political context.\n\nThough the 5 justices invocated the Equal Protection criteria, it is generally suspected of being a partisan scheme, arguing that Florida’s original recount was unconstitutional in fact has grounds: There is no convincing coherent basis for a state to physically recount under votes — ballots in which a machine doesn’t record any vote for president — but not over votes — ballots in which a machine records numerous entries for president (Mark1999)\n\nAlso, the 5 justices failed to remand Bush v. Gore to Florida after declaring that the recounting procedures in Florida as unconstitutional and argued that the issue was lawfully unjustified and defenseless. They explained that Dec. 12 was Florida’s self-imposed timeline for closing the presidential vote counting and choosing a schedule of electors for the winning candidate and that this timeline was hours to time Bush v. Gore was served.\n\nAccording to federal law, “when a state sets its schedule of electors by Dec. 12, the confines of the schedule is not subject to attack during Electoral College proceedings held in Congress on Jan. 6” (Learned 1958). While meeting such a timeline is to be desired, there is no hint at all that the state’s legislature desired to stick to this timeline at the cost of securing an exact vote count and the selecting of the equally justifiable schedule of presidential electors.\n\nAlternatives for the court\n\nThe court did not have to make any decisions from case. There were other alternatives available to the court, which made more sense than those selected the by Florida court. The State Supreme Court could have defined a “legal vote”, the refusal of which affected the election.\n\nThat is, the Supreme Court needed to look at other election statute, §101.5614(5), to deal with spoiled or defective votes that gives a proviso that no vote shall be disregarded “if there was an apparent sign of the intention of the voter as decided by the canvassing board” (Thayer).\n\nThe justices read that point of looking to the voter’s intention as implying that the legislature perhaps meant “legal vote” to refer to a vote recorded on ballots showing what the voter deliberated. It is apparent that the majority might have taken a different reading and thus it is constitutional to follow the majority’s opinion. This alternative preserves the court’s institutional legitimacy and the cherished democratic values. (Bickel 1986)\n\nThe courts could have refrained from interfering in the matter because of its political aspects. In respect to political question doctrines, there is a clear separation of power between the Supreme Court and other government institutions. The Supreme Court is not allowed to decide cases that are constitutionally committed to other branches of government. The courts are also obligated not to interfere with issues related to the legislative or executive branches of government to preserve the separation of powers.\n\nInstead the courts would have allowed the matter be resolved by the legislative branch of government which handles electoral processes. Therefore from the Bush v Gore case, it compromises our judicial system as the Supreme Court did not act appropriately in addressing the matter. In addition thought not in a large way, the case exposed how our civil liberties were being compromised and the inability of the judicial system to address them appropriately.\n\nReferences\n\nBickel A., (1986).

References\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne child policy is a measure that was adopted by the Chinese government in order to control the country’s population growth. As a family planning method, the one child policy was adopted by the highly populated country to limit the number of children that married couples are allowed to have.\n\nThis paper seeks to discuss the Chinese one child policy. The paper will look into the origin of the one child policy in china, its enforcement, reaction of the Chinese people towards the policy, effects that the policy has had in china as well as possible future effects of the policy in the people’s republic of China.\n\nThe Chinese one child policy\n\nThe one child policy as adopted in the people’s republic of China was introduced in the year 1979. The aim of the Chinese one child policy was to control the country’s population which was seen as a threat to the country’s resources.\n\nIn its application of the policy, the government of China strived to persuade its citizens into accepting the policy by offering appealing incentives to people to convince them to yield to the government’s population policy. The application of the policy has also emphasized on discouraging Chinese “citizens from having more than one child” (University of Florida, 2009, p. 1)\n\nOrigin of the one child policy in china\n\nThe Chinese one child policy was a sort of condition that was meant to counter the then Chinese problem of high population growth rate. There had been previous perceptions by Chinese leaders such as Zedong that the might of a country was measured by the size of the country’s population.\n\nWith respect to this opinion, Chinese people were encouraged to increase their birth rate with the aim of developing a stronger nation. The call for a larger population was seemingly received positively in the country since by the year 1953, the growth rate of the country’s population had sent alarming indicators and calls were made for population control (Boden, 2008, p. 104).\n\nThe impact of the population burst together with industrial revolution that was felt at the time then led for call to change Chinese population patterns. The government in its aim to provide quality services to its people also identified the management of the large population as a key to achieving development objectives of the then government (Greenhalgh, 2008, p. 45).\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, as china was undergoing economic recovery together with established peace and the then industrialization atmosphere, the high birth rates called for solutions as women were interested in working and supporting the industrial revolution yet they had the burden of carrying pregnancies and taking care of their young ones.\n\nThe then seemingly lack of knowledge among the Chinese women on how to control their child bearing led to their call for government assistance towards family planning. Further problems arose as a result of increased population as the government was being pressed with the responsibility of “employing, educating, feeding and housing” (Greenhalgh, 2008, p. 45) the large population.\n\nThe initial solution to the Chinese population problem was first thought to be a simultaneous “population growth, along with economic and social developments” (Greenhalgh, 2008, p. 45) which was proposed by people like Mao Zedong. The intensity of strain of the population on facilities however increased and opinions about family planning were considered.\n\nThe developments then led to the government taking the responsibility of directly controlling the country’s population. Research by the socialist government into the Chinese population structure then led to adoption of “state birth planning” in which the government had control of the number of children that were born (Greenhalgh, 2008, p. 47).\n\nAttempts to control the Chinese growing population started in the 1960s with measures such as “production of contraceptives and massive media campaigns promoting late marriage, low birth rates and the use of intrauterine devices” (IML, 2007, p. 1) among other steps to control fertility and birth rates in the country (IML, 2007, p. 1). Further considerations by the government, after intensive research, led to the adoption of the one child policy in the people’s republic of china in the year 1979.\n\nThe policy which was aimed at helping the government to reduce the country’s capacity to a level that it could adequately support had three main agendas: “delayed marriage and delayed child bearing, fewer and healthier births and one child per couple” (Learner, n.d., p. 1). The policy was however applied selectively. Its application depended on whether a person was staying in an urban or rural area among other factors (University of Florida, 2009, p. 1)\n\nImplementation of the one child policy in China\n\nThe implementation of the policy was not hard in urban areas as people were already under a lot of strain regarding social services. There was already shortage in accommodation facilities in china at the time and this made the child policy a welcomed idea because people saw it as a solution to the then housing crisis in Chinese urban centers. The Chinese government, which was the main employer in the urban centers, also ensured monitoring of its employees into the implementation of the policy.\n\nThe implementation of the policy was therefore considered to be smooth in urban areas. Challenges were however met in rural areas regarding the implementation of the one child policy. Poverty was one of the challenges that the policy faced in rural areas. Contrary to the opinion that poor families would opt for fewer children that they could afford to support, the Chinese peasants saw children as a future source of income that would support their parents in old age.\n\nChildren were also a source of labor to their parents in farms and limiting the number of children to one would deprive the parents of this labor force. Another challenge that faced the policy in rural areas was security that parents require during their old age in terms of material provisions and physical company.\n\nThe culture that children get married and women leave their parents to stay with their husbands led to a preference of boys by Chinese rural residents. A couple that was not yet blessed with a boy child would therefore not easily yield to a concept of family planning; leave alone a one child policy. Harsh conditions were however laid on citizens who failed to comply with the one child policy in terms of levies (IML, 2008, p. 1).\n\nThe implementation of the one child policy was also seen to be forceful as the government considered non compliance to be more of a constitutional offence. Couples who failed to honor the government’s initiative of having only one child were severely fined depending on where they lived. Fines that went as high as thousands of dollars were laid upon couples who conceived after their first child and cases of forced abortions were reported in the country as the government tried to enforce the policy.\n\nSofter implementation measures such as granting “longer maternity leave and other benefits to couples that delayed childbearing” (Fitzpatrick, 2009, p. 1) as well as recognition of couples “who volunteered to have one child” (Fitzpatrick, 2009, p. 1) were also employed in the implementation of the policy (Fitzpatrick, 2009, p. 1).\n\nCartier (2001) indicated that the Chinese one child policy implementation was not uniform. The way in which the policy was implemented together with its “acceptance and results” varied from one geographical region to another (Cartier, 2001, p. 187). People in agriculturally dominated rural areas were, for example, “allowed to have two children” (Cartier, 2001, p. 187) per couple.\n\nFurther exemptions were made to the policy if a couple’s first child was a girl, giving couples another chance to search for a boy child. The implementation was with this respect gender biased as it showed regard to boy child and not to girl child. It represented the girl child as of lower value by giving preference to the boy child only (Cartier, 2001, p. 187).\n\nReactions of the Chinese people towards the one child policy\n\nThe issue of one child policy brought about a lot of reaction from the Chinese people. Some of the witnessed reactions were steps to avoid penalties that government agencies laid on people who violated the policy, or to try to suite the government’s policy while some were just intended to criticize the policy.\n\nOne of the reactions of the Chinese people towards the introduction and the implementation of the one child policy was the abandonment or killing of children that were born contrary to the policy, or that according to parents were not favorable to the policy. The cause of this reaction was based on the traditional preference of male children to female children and cases of accidental pregnancies.\n\nCouples would, for example, have their first child but throw it away or kill for being a girl. The tradition in Chinese communities gave value to male children and parents for this reason felt obliged to comply with the one child policy while at the same time, they felt that they had to have a male child. The end result was killing or abandoning children if they were not boys. Unplanned pregnancies after a first child also resulted in abortions as couples tried to escape penalties of non compliance to the one child policy (Daniel, n.d., p. 1).\n\nImpacts of the Chinese one child policy\n\nThe immediate impact of the one child policy was the reduced population growth rate in the country. The birth rate in china was significantly reduced from its rate in the year 1979 which was recorded at 2.9 to its 1.4 as recorded in the year 2004.\n\nThe reduction in population growth rate was a success to the government that introduced the one child policy with the aim o f controlling the Chinese population that was growing at an alarming rate.\n\nChinese census that was conducted in the year 2000 revealed that the policy had been successful in controlling hundreds of millions of child births. Critics have however pointed out that the reduced birth rates realized in china is not purely attributable to the one child policy of the year 1979.\n\nThere had been other measures in china that had been established to help the country control its population growth. Policies that advocated for “later child bearing, greater spacing between children and fewer children” (Hesketh, 2005, p. 1) had been effective in reducing the Chinese population growth rate prior to the introduction of the one child policy. Critics have argued that policies that preceded the one child policy were considerably more successful that the famous one child policy.\n\nBefore the introduction of the one child policy in the year 1979, the population growth rate had been successfully reduced from its rate of over six to about 5.9 in the 1970. The introduction of population control policies after the year 1970 further reduced the growth rate from 5.9 in the year 1970 down to about three in the year 1979 (Hesketh, 2005, p. 1).\n\nThe one child policy together with influence prior policies therefore contributed to the final reduction of the rate from its value in the year 1979 down to its current approximation of about 1.7. It can thus be argued that the reduction in population growth rate might have still been realized even in the absence of the one child policy.\n\nThis view would cast a negative image on the policy makers who introduced the policy and called for its enforcement owing to the fact that most citizens, especially in rural areas, had contrary opinions to the demand of the policy. The sufferings and humiliations such as fines and forced abortions together with child murders and abandonments, which were realized as a result of the policy, would therefore have not been necessary as the fall in growth rate would still be realized subject to the earlier policies (Hesketh, 2005, p. 1).\n\nAnother impact of the one child policy in the Chinese population system is the increased ratio disparity between males and females. Owing to the traditional believes and preference of male children among the people of china, the limitation on the number of children that a couple are allowed to have has led to keenness on the sex of a child born to any particular couple.\n\nIn urban areas where the number of children is restricted to one per couple for example, the desire and preference of male children as compared to female children and the availability of ultrasonography has allowed couples to screen and determine the sex of an expected child. The effect of knowing that the unborn baby is a girl often leads to abortion in order to retain the one chance of child bearing for a boy child.\n\nThe same case was evidenced in rural areas especially after first born of couples. Since couples in these areas are allowed to have a second child if the first one happens to be a girl, emphases are put to ensure that the second birth is a boy. Any contrary indication, which can be detected through screening, results in abortion. The policy has therefore fueled gender discrimination that has been against women as they were considered to be of less value as compared to men.\n\nThe direct expression of this view over women and girls could have been a discouragement to young women as they felt unappreciated in the society. The increased gender disparity in terms of numbers also pose a social threat to societies as men will grow to find a deficit of women with whom new families can be established. There is therefore a looming fear of unmarried men in china in future as the number of men is expected to be very high as compared to that of women (Hesketh, 2005, p. 1).\n\nA secondary impact of the one child policy that reduced birth rate in China is the population ageing that has been noted in the country with more of it predicted to be witnessed in future. The effect of economic developments in china has led to vast improvements in social services that have led to improved living standards in the country.\n\nImproved health services as provided by the government has also contributed to better health care leading to increased life expectancy in the country. The reduced birth rate that has been realized in china, coupled with increased life expectancy has resulted in a situation where the number of young people is gradually decreasing while the number of the old in the country is on the increase.\n\nA normally stable population experiences a constant ratio of all demographic age groups since natural occurrences of death and birth rates cancel one another. A contrary observation is however made when both birth rate and death rate are on the decline subject to factors such as increased life expectancy. The effect of the reduced birth rate and death rate in the Chinese population for example has resulted in a majority of the population being composed of the elderly (Kaneda, 2011, p. 1).\n\nThe trend of the Chinese demographic pattern is expected to worsen with the percentage of the elderly projected to increase from less than ten percent in the year 2006 to about twenty four percent in the next four and a half decades. The population ageing, as a result of the reduced birth rate and coupled with increased life expectancy also has a variety of impacts that can be significantly attributed to the one child policy’s reduced birth rate.\n\nOne of the effects of the population ageing is the increased pressure on health services as required by the increasing number of the elderly. Health problems that are associated with old age are expected to be on the increase following increased number of the elderly. The resulting increased cost of taking care of these old people will be a strain to the government especially when the working force decrease due to population ageing causing a lapse in the country’ economy (Kaneda, 2011, p. 1).\n\nSimilarly, the change in Chinese demographic pattern leading to population aging has a direct effect on the country’s economic status. Couples being forced to have one child mean that in their old age, they will only have this one person to look up to for care and support. At the same time, the undersupplied economy in terms of labor force will also be depending on this same person to work in the economy. The end result is a shortage in labor force in the economy as well as strained facilities for taking care of the elderly.\n\nThe economy is going to be strained in the sense that in every place of two people who will be getting old and leaving the labor force, there will be a lesser corresponding fraction getting into the labor force due to reduced birth rate. Similarly, the elderly need for attention and someone to take care of them will also be faced with a challenge as their sole respective children will be involved in economic activities trying to obtain finances to support both themselves and their old parent.\n\nThe overall impact then lays on the government whose responsibility includes ensuring that the elderly are taken care of. The government will then be forced to offer services for the elderly as the young ones work in the economy. This will consequently strain the government due to increased expenditure on the economically inactive old people and reduced labor force due to the ageing population (Kaneda, 2011, p. 1).\n\nPossible solutions to negative impacts of the one child policy\n\nThe one child policy has been associated with effects that are not favorable to the country’s economic and even social aspects. One of the steps that can be taken to counter these problems is “loosening fertility restrictions to allow more births” (Banister, 2009, p. 29). Reduced restriction would allow for more children who will in future fill the gaps left in labor force as well as participate in caring for the elderly.\n\nEstablishing funds to provide services to the elderly as well as enacting rules that put legal responsibility of daughters who are single children to take care of their parents in old age. This will shift the government’s expenditure from social services for the elderly to other national development programs (Banister, 2009, p. 29).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe establishment of the one child policy in china in the year 1979 seemed to have been a misinformed policy. This is because of a number of reasons that starts from the fact that the reduced birth rate in the country was more significant before the adoption of the policy as compared to after its adoption when birth rate stabilized.\n\nThe policy has therefore failed to achieve its objective that was to reduce population growth rate. On the other hand, the policy has brought a number of negative side effects like government’s oppression on couples who failed to comply with the policy, abortions, increased gender imbalance ratio as well as disregard to female children. This paper therefore holds the conclusion that the Chinese one child policy was not a good policy.\n\nReferences\n\nBanister, J. (2009) Coping with population aging in china. Web.\n\nBoden, J.

      "Jeff Koons’ Contemporary Artwork Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nJeff Koons is a self-proclaimed distinct artist born in 1955, who is a resident of New York: USA, where majority of his artworks exhibit. The common artwork of the artist include the inflatable balloons toys and the pink panther, beside the life-size ceramic model of the late pop star Michael Jackson holding his favourite pet, chimpanzee babbles as shown below.\n\nAccording to Raine, Koons became famous for his unique artwork, which exhibited massively as a culture of iconography (1). The art was celebrated as a banality, which captured the taste of the middle-class earners. Political attack or most certainly resistance of the art forms by the public often isolates Jeff Koons’ work from other forms. Like other artists such as Pablo Picasso, who was concern with modernism, Koons’ artwork especially the celebration of banality faces criticism due to people’s different personal values.\n\nThesis Statement\n\nPollock’s argument that “feminist and Marxist approaches to art history should not work separately, but should combine to a more unified theory of social art history (18),” show that social complexities such as race, class differences ought to strengthen a piece of artwork.\n\nImpression Presented by Banality\n\nJeff Koons tries to nurture views to people who can stand by their own taste and preferences through personal judgement as opposed to following influences. His response to banality is therefore as a move towards fighting guilt and shame. Jeff often urges that his venture to banality was to empower those in the middle class known as bourgeois to be imaginative, especially those who are conservative and materialistic, whose aim is to exploit the working class.\n\nAccording to his argument, people deny their true being because of social differences and the urge to belong to a better social class (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1). Koons’ work is that of a post-modernism artist that highlights the social needs such as health needs for people in the twenty first century.\n\nPost-modernism is a reaction towards consumerism, where the art accepts and cerebrate the emerging banalities (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1). A good example is the art of food that anticipates the banality of obesity or other food related affluences.\n\nThe health and social affluences such as health complications are highly concentrated with the middle class or the lower social-economic categories that are rigid to take awareness strategies critically. The artist therefore has an alternative strategy of ironically presenting the banalities of affluence instead of endorsing promotional activities that people are not ready to embrace.\n\nIconography Vs Interpretation\n\nJeff Koons is also trying to emphasize that the adventure of modern art is long overdue. Contemporary art does not therefore transcend and diverge from the past or towards the future. According to Pollock, modern art is today based on reality such that its operations are real-time not distinguishable through the technical, or digital categories among others (47).\n\nOne such magnificent art is the Michael Jackson and Bubbles sculpture that comprises visually complicated art, but one that presents viewers with ambiguous perceptions and interpretations. Critical analysis of the sculpture shows that the view is allowed to make personal association. The portrait is styled in various ways with additional aspects that diverts from the pop star’s lifestyle appearance. The artist primarily creates a layer of meaning using porcelain.\n\nThis light coloured medium presents the portraits skin colour as that of the white race. The viewers are aware that the pop star was a black man and absence of black or dark colour might be taken as a hateful sign among observers. What about the pet chimpanzee, babbles that can also be easily picked as an insulting typecast to the black community due to historical derogatory considerations. The interpretation can easily go beyond the pet portrait.\n\nThe colour is a sharp contrast to the natural hue, since the portrait is gold and porcelain white except for the eyes and mouth. Gold colour can have different interpretations such as; the artwork is a luxury wealth masterpiece or it interprets sovereignty. Michael Jackson figure represents an iconic celebrity and therefore the sculpture may imply that celebrities have royal cultures. Jeff Koons’ work is therefore characterized more by interpretation than iconography.\n\nMichael Jackson and Bubbles sculpture\n\nKitsch Vs Art\n\nOn the line or royalty and aristocracy, Astrap Fearnley Museum of art indicates that ceramic can present art as well as universally democratized and make all art to follow common style (1).\n\nThe ceramics were initially considered to be high-class art styles, but later transformed to middle-class aesthetics and eventually they are common in contemporary high-class art works such as the Michael Jackson sculpture. There is indication that banality expressionism is today levelling the differences between art and kitsch. In relation to Wolff’ argument, the class has huge impact on forms of arts especially the production (52).\n\nFinished artwork requires ample amount of resources particularly monetary funding to display in museums or sell in a galleries/exhibitions. Capital and social power are requirements for fostering the art in museums, journal article and as a topic of discussion in curriculums. The high-class ideology is thus a major stepping-stone, but contrary, kitsch is more popular among masses because of the involved uniqueness.\n\nKitsch is an ideology of artwork that was an outcome since the end of the modernism-art era. The separation between kitsch and art has caused a prosperous foundation that inspires conceptual artists like Jeff Koons. Arguably, Koons’ sculpture of Michael Jackson represented the mixture and not the distinction since the statuette is in a predominant location of a museum, with well-labelled tags representing aspects of high arts.\n\nOn the other hand, the non-ancient particularly gold-painted ceramics are rare in main museums. The “Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art” in Oslo Norway houses the Michael Jackson sculpture and they emphasis on the way Jeff Koons emphasized the taste of the middle class through use of various elements (1).\n\nMarxist Perspective or Art\n\nMarxist’s style of analysing art has a basis on its history of production, social class, documentation and consumption. According to Wolff, if one would consider the social reasons for inventing an artwork, “art historians should extend this idea one step further and recognize that art itself participates in one or more ideologies (54).”\n\nIn line with her interpretation, “the term ideology refers to as a system of beliefs characteristic of a particular class or group (54).” Artists have different ideologies depicted on their artworks. The final production is thus an ideological creation or activity. Industrialized art works are easy to duplicate and cheaper for the purchasing power of the common person in the working class. The baroque style of production may contrary represent the luxury imitation of upper class by the middle class.\n\nJeff koons’ Iconic Pink Panther\n\nIn May 2010, the Pink Panther sculpture hanging on a bare back of a pretty light-coloured feminine figure by Jeff Koons fetched approximately $30 million at Sotheby contemporary art auction (Pollock, 39). The sculpture made from porcelain was also one of the banality collections.\n\nLike the other outstanding copies at the “Museum of modern art in New York”, “Museum of contemporary Art in Chicago” and Private collections. Pink panther was outstanding in the artist career. The represented reality fails to capture the attention of the heart as well as human feelings or presentation overcomes the situation. There is little research that forms a clear critic over Koons’ style of handling sexuality.\n\nThe Pink Panther sculpture indicates his obsession with sexuality and gender based desires. The themes that touch on such banality aspects like sex, celebrity, awkward commerce, race and media are better aspects of addressing materialism, consumerism, contemporary lifestyles, and class or power differences (Pollock, 47). Arguably, his consideration of life was that a simple subject makes the work to be a philosophical dissertation for the social issues concerning artwork.\n\nJeff koons’ Iconic Pink Panther\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Marxist point of view, “it is hardly surprising that some members of the art institution are less than thrilled about kitsch’s appearance in the high art world.” When Jeff Koons was asked about his artworks, the emphasis was on the need to represent the natural feeling in the work. Most artist would not with to be labelled Kitsch since it is associable to middle and low class. Koons’ arts are nevertheless found in major museums.\n\nHis works are a clear profession of Kitsch but acceptable as art because he is able to find marketing strategies such as use of seductive finishing that indicates luxury, flawlessness and quality (Raine, 1). These are high-class ideologies that cause recognition of the artworks. The artist is thus a friend to Kitsch and the taste of the middle-class, but has high-class marketing techniques. He alleviate the middleclass themes to upper-class levels and in accordance to Marxist theory, this cross-class revolution may either imply revolution of exploitation.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAstrap Fearnley Museum of art. “Jeff Koons” Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art . 2011.

      "The World is Flat Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The trend towards Globalization\n 3. “The world is flat”\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nGlobalization is the current issue making waves around the world. The trend towards globalization is simply awesome especially in the third world countries. Over the years, some economists have expressed their views in support of globalization while others, have criticized it. However, with due respect accorded both parties over their respective opinions, it is worthy of note here that globalization is an issue that has come to stay particularly with the trend towards it. (Duiker, 306)\n\nIn his book “The world is flat,” Thomas Friedman argues in favor of what he calls “The Dell Theory of conflict prevention.” But William Duiker, who is also a writer, thinks differently. Duiker believes the trend towards globalization may be offset by a simultaneous trend towards fragmentation.\n\nThis argumentative essay is written in favor of Thomas Friedman’s hypothesis which he calls “The Dell theory of conflict prevention.” In the course of this essay, Thomas Friedman’s book “The world is flat” will be summarized and explained to support the argument.\n\nLastly, in the concluding part of the essay, it will be shown how globalization is greatly taking over the world. In developing and developed countries respectively, the issue of globalization is of top priority as no country in the world wants to be left behind.\n\nThe trend towards Globalization\n\nThere is barely a country or nation in the present world which has not joined the trend towards globalization or intends to be a part of it in the nearest future. In this 21 st century when the world is classified or termed as a global village, global governors, super powers of the world and international organizations like, the United Nations, (UN) European Union, (EU) and the African Union, (AU) are not resting in their campaigns to take globalization to the next level. (Duiker, 712)\n\nThe present world is a highly technological advanced world. Virtually everything in our daily lives is connected to one technology or the other. In the health sector, highly advanced technical tools are used to perform neuron surgeries, plastic surgeries and treat diseases of different kinds. In terms of education, schools have launched websites and portals which enable students pay school fees on the internet from anywhere in the world.\n\nThere is also an immense improvement in the communication sector as new devices are invented thus making communication easier and cheaper. Today, people communicate through different mediums like, phones and the internet which records a tremendous 20 million users daily. In the agricultural sector, agric products are processed into baked foods and beverages. All these and more are made possible and easy through technological advancement. (Duiker, 432)\n\nEven in farming, technological equipments enable agricultural systems like; irrigation, cross breeding and rearing of animals or live stocks. The aforementioned examples explain why there is a trend towards globalization and the reader will agree with me that, our every day lives are influenced and made easy due to the advancement in technology. As the world advances so does the need for improvement in our lives arises too thus the desire and clamor for the world to be totally globalized will continue to increase.\n\n“The world is flat”\n\nIn the first part of Thomas Friedman’s book “The world is flat,” he tries to show or explain how the world became flat. Literally, Friedman tries to say there is a level playing field for everybody and this means that, there is enough room for every individual, group of people, companies, international forums and governments of nations to compete and gain global knowledge. (Duiker, 822)\n\nFreidman moves on to use Asian countries like, Japan, China and India as examples to illustrate his point about room created for everyone to progress.\n\nHowever, Friedman attributes this opportunity to what he calls world flatteners. Then he goes ahead to list ten forces which are responsible for the flattening of the world and these forces are; the steroids, the September terrorist attack on the US, (9/11) outsourcing, off shoring, uploading, Netscape’s public date, informing, uploading, in sourcing and work flow software. (Friedman, 671)\n\nFriedman tries to show that, these technological advancement which are as a result of globalization are capable of also causing disasters if in the wrong hands and this fact has changed the thinking of many nations thus creating room for anybody to compete and gain global knowledge. (Friedman, 612)\n\nFriedman talks about “America and the flat world” in the second part of his book then in the third part of his book, he talks about “Developing countries and the flat world.” He shows how America is the world power and is economically at advantage due to her technological advancement. He also highlights the problems and challenges in the American society but he is adamant, optimistic and envisages what the American economy will be like in future. As for developing countries, Friedman in the third part of his book suggests the necessary steps to be taken in order to meet up the high speed of development other countries have attained. He uses Ireland as an example of a willing society and leaders with vision and how these factors helped propel Ireland from a less developed European country to an advanced one. (Duiker, 231)\n\nIn part four, Friedman talks about “companies and the flat world” while in part five of his book, “Geopolitics and the flat world” is discussed. In part four, Friedman explains seven factors which are responsible for the growth of companies and he advices other smaller companies to emulate the already advanced ones.\n\nThen in part five, he talks about international politics of the world and envisages problems that might arise from the flattened world. Here, he suggests the application of “Dells theory of conflict prevention.” Friedman believes that if flattening is not handled properly, it might also come with its demerits and he cites terrorist and global warming as examples. (Friedman, 421)\n\nConclusion\n\nGlobalization has demerits just as anything else in life. There are always two sides to every career, scientific discovery and a new technology invented or a world trend like globalization. However, you will agree with me that, the gains or merits that are achieved from globalization greatly supersede the demerits and it is therefore, worth the risk.\n\nIt can then be inferred that, the trend towards globalization is a right step in the right direction which is worth taking regardless of its disadvantages. This means it requires more than just offsetting a simultaneous trend to fragment globalization. With the constructive argument above, it can be reasonably concluded that, between William Duiker and Thomas Friedman, Friedman is correct amongst the two writers.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDuiker, William.

      "Susan Glaspell’s biography and historical context in relation to Trifles Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Short Synopsis\n 3. Biographical Interpretation\n 4. Historical Interpretation\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nWritten by Susan Glaspell, Trifles is a masterpiece rich in both historical and biographical elements. Glaspell hinges this story on a murder story she had to cover as a journalist and this offers the biographical part of it. The historical element of Trifles sprouts from some of the themes presented in this play. Therefore, Trifles is both a biographical and historical play.\n\nShort Synopsis\n\nAs the play opens, police are investigating the murder of John Wright in his farmhouse. More people arrive amongst them the Sheriff, his wife, the county attorney, his wife and a witness. Controversy surrounds Mr. Wright’s death, whilst the attorney and police officers believe Mrs. Wright’s story that someone murdered Mr. Wright, as she was sleep, the women in this play suspect that Mrs. Wright was involved in the killing after collecting some ‘trifle’ evidence from this farmhouse.\n\nThe men in this play cannot understand why women are always concerned about small things. For instance, they cannot understand why these women are so concerned about a guilt they have found in the house.\n\nIn turn of events, these women find an empty birdcage, and after continued search, they discover a dead bird in a box; strangled just like Mr. Wright. At this point, Mrs. Hale reminisces how felicitous Mrs. Wright was, as a kid; how she loved singing and how miserable she became after marrying Mr. Wright.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Wright killed his wife’s bird and in retaliation, Mrs. Wright murdered him. Nevertheless, these women sympathize with Mrs. Wright’s sufferings as a wife and they decide to hide this information from the police officers to cover Mrs. Wright’s guilt. Nevertheless, as aforementioned, the biographical and historical context of this play can give a better interpretation.\n\nBiographical Interpretation\n\nWritten in 1921, Trifles is a chronicle of John Hossack’s controversial murder, which Glaspell happened to cover as a journalist “with the Des Moines Daily New” ( Holstein 2003, p. 29 ).\n\nOn December 2, 1900, John Hossack was murdered. According to his wife of 33 years, “…was sleeping beside him and awoke to the sound of an axe twice striking something that turned out later to be her husband’s head. She leapt out of bed and ran into the living room, where she saw a light and heard the door closing…returned to her bedroom with her children and discovered him to be mortally injure” (Reuben, 2008, p. 13).\n\nThe coroner’s results could not find any crucial information about the death. However, after rigorous investigations, police officers arrested Margaret Hossack after finding the murder weapon hidden in a maize garner. Moreover, a neighbor indicated that the Hossack’s marriage was strained.\n\nGlaspell played key role in profiling this murder. She, “provided thorough coverage of the case…she often made use of a lurid combination of gossip, rumor, and truth to report her stories. Glaspell’s descriptions of Margaret generally painted her as an insane murderer until her visit to the farmhouse in mid-December, after which her depiction softened Mrs. Hossack into a meek, elderly woman” (Reuben, 2008, p.16).\n\nUnfortunately, Mrs. Hossack was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. However, her judges appealed for a second trail and after reaching no verdict, Mrs. Hossack was released on for lack of evidence.\n\nMargaret’s initial conviction was inevitable for she could not be trusted because; for one, she had a child out of wedlock and she acted inappropriately and disrespectfully by exposing her marital problems. On the other hand, men involved in this case defended Mr. Hossack as an honorable citizen and a good person.\n\nTrifles offer women’s perspective towards this case and their different point of view in domestic troubles and marital strife. The fact that the women in Trifles did not divulge the crucial information leading to Mrs. Wright’s acquittal, it shows that their ‘trifles’ are significant as opposed to men’s view of the same. Glaspell simply chronicled the events surrounding Mr. Hossack’s death by changing character’s names.\n\nHistorical Interpretation\n\n“ Trifles” is essentially a presentation of challenges that women faced in late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Born in 1876, Glaspell was among the first women to pursue higher education and a profession at a time when this was a preserve of the men.\n\nBy writing Trifles, Glaspell sought to address issues like, “women’s suffrage, birth control, socialism, union organizing, and the psychological theories of Sigmund Freud” (Godwin, 1999, p. 46). At this time, women could not participate in juries or even vote. Women earned way below their male counterparts; moreover, as aforementioned most women qualified as ‘housewives’ and nothing more.\n\nThe same case applied to urban women; a subject that Trifles addresses. Women were not recognized as important figures in the society; something that Mrs. Wright experienced. Nevertheless, Glaspell finally manages to show that women were significant after all. Their ‘trifles’ were significant if only men would recognize it. For instance, their ‘trifles’ led to discovery of a strangled bird; something that would convict Mrs. Wright; therefore, women would sit in juries, if given opportunity.\n\nMrs. Peters explicates how women suffered and lived at the mercies of their ever-busy husbands. She remembers how Mrs. Wright would sing melodiously as a bird during her childhood; however, she bemoans that things changed the moment Mrs. Wright married. She notes that Mr. Wright “first killed the song in her and finally killed the song in her bird” (Glaspell, 1951, p. 14). Loneliness was consuming many women including those who did not face marital strife.\n\nFor instance, Mrs. Peters painfully recalls, “…we were homesteaders in the Dakota Territory, when our first baby died leaving me alone in the house most of the day while my husband worked outside…” (Glaspell, 1951, p. 18). Glaspell sought to highlight these historical issues that affected women relegating them to insignificant figures in society. This theme offers the historical interpretation of this play.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy writing Trifles, Glaspell had two distinct issues in her mind. First, she wanted to chronicle her experience as a journalist and two, she wanted to highlight historical challenges that women faced in her era.\n\nThe events surrounding Mr. Wright’s death in Trifles are similar to those, which surrounded the murder of Mr. Hossack on December 2, 1900. Glaspell changes the names of the characters but the incidences are the same. Even though she tried to paint Mrs. Hossack as a murderer, her stance changed when she visited Hossack’s house only to realize what Mrs. Hossack went through as a wife.\n\nTherefore, Trifles is a dramatized personal experience touching the life and career of Glaspell as a journalist. Historically, women were not recognized in the society. Most of them lived miserable lives, something that Glaspell highlights in this play. Urban women lived lonely lives, as their husbands were ever busy. Therefore, Trifles is both a biographical and historical play.\n\nReference List\n\nGlaspell, S. (1951). Trifles: A Play in One Act.

      "Problem Analysis Problem Solution Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Problem Statement\n 3. Problem analysis\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nEmployees’ attitude is very important to every human resource manager in any organization. The performance of the organization depends largely with the attitude of the employees’ (Chin-Ju & Sengupta, 2010, p.1). The attitude of the employee towards work can be demonstrated by his or her behaviors in the work place.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nMany employees have negative attitude in the work place that affects their performance in the jobs. Even though there are many other factors that affect the output of employees such self-motivation, communication, and technical competencies, employee attitude has the greatest impact on the performance of the employees (Ciutiene & Adamoniene, 2009, p.48).\n\nWhen employees lack the right attitude towards the job they are doing or even to the whole organization, they lack morale to work hard to achieve the objectives of the organization. This in turn will lower the performance of the organization. In this paper, I will therefore analyze how managers can realize there is a problem of attitude among the employees.\n\nProblem analysis\n\nAttitude refers to the view or opinion a person has towards something; for instance in an organization, the view of the employees toward the success of the organization, management of the organization, and even products that are produced in the organization. Attitude in the work place may also be expressed by how employees view what they are told to do including rules and regulations of the organization.\n\nFor example, when the employees have the right attitude towards the goals and objectives of the organization, reporting to work before time and leaving late after the official time will not be a problem to the employees. However, if they have negative attitude towards the success of the organization, they will report to work late and leave earlier if there is no rule to restrict them to do so.\n\nAttitude in the work place is indicated by the rate of turnover and the productivity of the employees. Negative attitude will result in high rate of turnover and low rate of productivity among the employees. Positive attitude in the work place is indicated by high rate of productivity and low rate of turnover among the employees. Thus by assessing these two factors, managers are in a position to know the attitude of their employees in the work place.\n\nThe following ways or techniques are used to show there is a problem of employees’ attitude in the organization: constant complaints towards the supervisors, rudeness, refusal to share one’s opinion, ignorance, disobedience to the rules of the organizational, and viewing everything pessimistically in the work place among others. These behaviors can demonstrate to the managers and supervisors that an employees does not like what he or she does.\n\nIn order to frame this problem, human resource manager ought to use appropriate strategies that will not worsen the situation but instead solve the problem without confrontation with employees.\n\nThese strategies include giving employees an opportunity to express their views towards what is happening in the organization, counseling if the problem is caused by personal issues, giving an employee time off to resolve their personal issues, appreciating that there is a problem but showing employees how they can participate in solving it.\n\nAs Edit (2008) argues, negative attitude can be caused by stress (p.360).These strategies and many others will help to change the attitude that employees have towards their job and the whole organization.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe performance of employees depends with the attitude they have towards work. High rate of turnover and low productivity of employees are signs of negative attitude among the employees. Human resources manager therefore ought to address this problem using appropriate methods such as creating an open forum with employees, counseling among others.\n\nReferences\n\nChin-Ju T., Edwards, P., & Sengupta, S.

      "Variable Identification Essay\n\nAn independent variable is one that is manipulated and controlled by the researcher; on the other hand the dependent variable is the one that is observed and measured so as to understand the effects of manipulating its independent counterpart.\n\nHowever, these two variables are not the only ones present in an experiment. Extraneous variables may also be present and play a great role in influencing the research.\n\nIf a researcher wanted to study the effects that inadequate instructions have on level of anger or frustration, variable identification is requisite. The ability of the researcher to define the variables in an operational approach is very important because it makes the study’s outcomes more valid and reliable for use at present times and in future.\n\nIn this case, the independent variable is represented by the inadequate instructions while the level of frustration or anger is a variable that solely depends on the inadequate instructions given.\n\nHaving identified the variables, the next step is to make them operational. At this point, the researcher should select a concept to ensure that anger is a result of the instructions given. However, the concept chosen should be within the limits of time, feasibility and financial ability. For instance, a researcher in this case may come up with a rewarding competition where the competitors are given limiting instructions.\n\nThe competition may be presented inform of an aptitude exam. It should be clearly stipulated that a competitor can only win by completing a given task within a specified time frame. When a short but logical period of time is set, it may result into frustration of the subjects being studied.\n\nIn order to measure anger, various methods could be used. For example, an oral interview at the end of the competition may give the researcher an opportunity to evaluate anger or frustration level especially for those who did not win. Another method that could be used is the filling of a questionnaire at the end of the study. A set of questions could be asked and based on the response; the researcher may be able to measure the level of frustration or anger.\n\nIn many experiments, extraneous and confounding variables will always be there. An extraneous variable can be described as unwanted variable that influences the experiment other than the variables being studied.\n\nThese variables are objectionable because in most cases they produce erroneous outcomes. They are divided into two, the first one being participant variables that are linked to the characteristics of an individual participant and which may have an impact on the response.\n\nThese variables may include factors like intelligence, mood and background differences. In the example of the aptitude test case given here, the extraneous variable might be pre-knowledge that competitors have on the questions being asked. If the competitors had seen the questions, then they might have an easy time and as result may not show any signs of frustration.\n\nThe other category of extraneous variables is the situational ones, which are associated with environmental factors that may influence the response of the participant. For example, if the test is being given in a room that is very hot, the high temperature may frustrate some participants while others may remain comfortable despite the impediment.\n\nIn conclusion, extraneous variables should be avoided as much as possible by carefully choosing a concept that will ensure they are minimized. For instance, the researcher should ensure that the test is being given in a room where all the participants feel comfortable.\n\nThe room should neither be very cold nor very hot. The participants should be carefully selected to ensure fairness; for example, they should be of the same age and of the same social background. Failure to alleviate these variables may produce incorrect results, and therefore compromise the validity and reliability of the research.\n",
      "Poverty and the Environment Expository Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Poverty and the environment\n 2. World poverty\n 3. Persistence of global poverty\n 4. Addressing global poverty\n 5. Benefits of global poverty\n 6. Reference List\n\nPoverty exists when one lacks typical socially acceptable things or possessions. People who are in poverty lack basic needs vary from one context to another. The common understanding of basic needs is things necessary for continued existence.\n\nMany people around the globe face the problem of poverty. Poverty links to human population and their activities on the environment. The human population affects the environment negatively due to poverty resulting to environmental degradation and a cycle of poverty.\n\nPoverty and the environment\n\nPoverty and the environment are interlinked as poverty leads to degradation of the environment. On the other hand, the issues of poverty eradication and degradation of the environment are often treated separately hence failure in addressing the issues effectively and reducing poverty around the globe.\n\nHuman activities have led to destruction of the environment and the trend shows that there is a bleak future ahead unless the destructive activities on the environment are halted or regulated to avoid destroying the environment further as the future generations are in jeopardy (Ezeonu, 2004).\n\nFor instance, people living in poverty destroy natural resources such as forests to clear land to plant food. Consequently, deforestation leads to environment challenges like flooding. Moreover, the high number of human population also causes destruction of the environment when people live on land near rivers and clear tracts of forests to inhabit.\n\nWorld poverty\n\nClose to forty per cent of the world’s total population live in poverty according to World Bank estimate in 2004(Whitman, 2008). Explosion in population causes a strain on the environment and pushes millions of people into poverty. Poverty varies from one country to another and poverty in developing countries is dire than in the developed countries.\n\nPoverty depends on class, race and gender. For example, more women than men live in poverty (Kendall, 2009). The poor struggle in their lives as they are disadvantaged in the society and often face prejudice of being lazy.\n\nWorld poverty is caused by a number of factors such as inequality of resource distribution, wars and conflicts, natural disasters such as earthquakes, flooding and droughts, degradation of the environment and social inequality among others. It is important to note that the levels of world poverty have reduced with global economic growth but many people are still living in poverty.\n\nPersistence of global poverty\n\nThe reasons for persistence of world poverty are things such as discriminatory trade policies that favor only the developed countries at the international market and exploit the developing nations hence they are unable to make a profit that can be used in fighting poverty (Wade, 2004).\n\nWars and conflicts that emerge in countries from time to time keep people in poverty for instance the war in Iraq has contributed to high levels of poverty to the citizens. Other factors such as corruption in governments make fighting poverty impossible as a few rich embezzle public funds.\n\nThe continued unequal distribution of resources confines people to poverty. Furthermore, those born in poor families are unable to breakaway from the cycle as they do not get opportunities to acquire education and thus grow and live in poverty as their poor parents (Pogge, 2008).\n\nAddressing global poverty\n\nHowever, world poverty can be addressed by acknowledging that poverty and the environment are connected. Then look for ways of helping people to acquire food without having the need to deforest. If people can access food they are can concentrate on economic activities to improve their situation.\n\nGovernments should also deal with corruption because it leads to misuse of funds that would have been used to lift the standards of living of the people.\n\nThe international business laws and policies should also change to give all countries a fair opportunity at the international market. More importantly, people should be empowered through training and given access to loans to start small businesses to gain a source of livelihood.\n\nBenefits of global poverty\n\nSome countries may favor continued world poverty because it enables them to take advantage of the poor countries that depend on them by exploiting resources in such countries through multinational corporations.\n\nThe organizations in such countries that concern themselves with the issue of poverty may never want to see poverty eradicated because they would not have any business and many of their employees would become jobless. The countries may also want poverty to continue so that they can lend loans with high interest to poor nations (Mack, 2009). Thus, world poverty may benefit a few countries.\n\nReference List\n\nEzeonu, I.C. Poverty and the environment: sociologizing environmental protection in sub-Saharan Africa.

It's even lent its name to a food truck and a new garden.\n\nAnd after seven years, Big Blue is getting a bit of a facelift. But will it go far enough?\n\nThe 10,000-pound, forty-foot-tall sculpture, created by artist Lawrence Argent, needs a tuneup, according to Arts & Venues Denver. It \"has seen the effects of time and will be re-coated and repainted to bring him back to his sparkling blue color,\" the city reports, a process that will take eleven days and wrap up on October 1 (weather permitting). \"The seven-year-old will also get some routine maintenance done to his steel and concrete shell.\"",
      "Posted 2008-01-02, evaluated by djpretzel\n\nWelcome to 2008! С Новым годом! I'm thoroughly convinced, based on everything that's in the works (from album projects to stuff I've been slaving away over in secret the last few months), that this is going to be the biggest, best year in this site's history. Yeah, I know, it sounds like empty rhetoric, but 2007 was pretty epic, and I wouldn't be making this statement if I didn't think we could match and, indeed, surpass it. Ultimately, no matter how much we add, quality ReMixes are the heart of the matter, and we've got a solid, active panel working down the queue. In general, things are *good*, and getting better.\n\nVampire Hunter Dan starts '08 off right, with a fantastic epic orchestral arrangement from Square's Threads of Fate for the PS1. Our first ReMix from a Square game, 8 years after the site opened? Just goes to show that there's still a goldmine of material out there, and that even uber-popular companies like Square have titles not yet ReMixed. VHD writes:\n\n\"Hello. I'm writing to submit an arrangement/remix of mine called \"Mint ~ The Spirit is Willing.\" This is an orchestral arrangement of themes from Threads of Fate, including 'Recollection,' 'The Bonds,' 'Sunny Smile,' and the 'Opening Title.'\"\n\nNice title tilde use - très Japanese! If I listened to this without the above context, I probably wouldn't have guessed it covered multiple originals; it's very cohesive, as Dan's only gotten progressively better at weaving orchestral tapestries that do a wonderful job of combining solo and ensemble passages, varied and appropriate instrumentation, and exceptional attention to dynamics. bustatunez was just saying on #ocremix the other day how versatile French horn is as an instrument, spanning a formidable dynamic and octave range. This arrangement makes good use of the instrument, as well as mixed winds, chromatic percussion, and more string articulations than you can shake a stick at - check the trills at 2'28\" for just one of many examples. There's bassoon in there, too, so we avoid the embarrassing faux pas of \"lacks bassoon\" entirely. At 4'16\", with the Spaceballs-style alternating timpani, I didn't see how the mix was going to transition into two more minutes of material, but the ReMixer actually pulls it off. Excellent work covering an amalgam of compelling source material in a single arrangement that, while it has discrete sections, never suffers from medleyitis and keeps things fresh and exciting. A great start to the new year, and another great ReMix from Vampire Hunter Dan!",
      "Q. Sorontar [þ] m. \"King of Eagles\"\n\nThe Quenya name of Thorondor, a compound of the prefixal form soron- of soron \"eagle\" and the word element tar \"king\" used in compounds (SA/thoron; Ety/TĀ, THOR).\n\nConceptual Development: In the earliest Lost Tales, this character's name once appeared as ᴱQ. Ramandur (LT2/203) but in this instance it was replaced by ᴱQ. Sorontur \"King of Eagles\", which was his usual Qenya name in the early stories (LT1/73, LT2/192). His name appeared in the Etymologies from the 1930s as ᴹQ. Sorontar \"King of Eagles\", and these entries are the source for the etymology given above (Ety/TĀ, THOR). This name appeared in Silmarillion revisions and notes from the 1950s (MR/410, WJ/272) and also in The Silmarillion appendix (SA/thoron), but Christopher Tolkien did not include it in the main text of the published version of The Silmarillion.",
      "Could social media be making people more anti-social?\n\nThe social media boom continues to make it easier than ever to stay in touch with loved ones in real time. But with the flourishing of new technology and the ability to be connected to anyone and everyone at any time, real-life human interactions could be suffering a heavy blow.\n\nA recent global study conducted by Kasperksy Lab reveals that social media users are interacting less face-to-face than in the past because of this newfound ability to constantly communicate and stay in touch online. In the study, researchers found that about one-third of people communicate less with their parents (31%), partners (23%), children (33%) and friends (35%) because they can simply follow them on social media. This may be doing more harm than good, in a world where editing one's life to make it appear perfect is more appealing than naturally existing.\n\n\"Under certain circumstances they perceive their online communication as 'hyper-personal communication' and thus they can misread and over-interpret the messages on social media,\" said Dr. Astrid Carolus, Media Psychologist at the University of Würzburg. \"We feel especially close, we blind out the rather negative, focus on the possible positive intentions behind a message, and over-interpret.\"\n\nThe study was conducted between October and November of last year among 16,750 participants, split evenly between men and women at least 16 years old from 18 countries, each of whom was surveyed online.\n\nParticipants were surveyed on the types of items they post on social media and the types of posts from others that have positive or negative influences on their moods. They were also asked about things they might do if meant obtaining more \"likes\" from their followers, including such things as posting salacious photos of friends or co-workers, or revealing sensitive information about someone else.\n\nMany participants made it clear that social media made them jealous of others. Nearly 60% of the participants viewed a friend as having a better life than their own simply by seeing that friend's social media activity, and almost half were upset after viewing photos from a friend's happy holiday celebration.\n\nThe study also found that \"people go on social media to feel better.\" Half of the participants reported using the outlets as a means to post optimistic things, and 61% said they go on to post things that make them smile.\n\nResearchers ultimately found that many people will go to harmful lengths simply to win \"likes\" from followers. \"This study has shown us that in order to generate more likes and feel better about the time they spend on social media, people are being tempted into sharing more information; potentially putting themselves and the people they care about at risk,\" the authors concluded.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\n61% of the participants felt worse after finding out someone \"unfriended\" them, and 59% were upset after someone posted a negative or critical comment on their profile\n\n57% said after going on social media they've felt that someone they follow has a better life than they do\n\n59% felt sad after seeing photos from a party they didn't attend posted on social media and 45% were unhappy after seeing photos from a friend's happy holiday outing\n\n58% were angered by a photo a friend posted of them online that they didn't want made public\n\n54% felt upset when no one liked or commented on a photo they posted\n\n42% were jealous when they saw a friend had more likes or comments than they did on a status update\n\nJust 31% of people aren't bothered by the number of likes they receive on a post\n\n24% of men said they worry that if they get few like, their friends will think that they are unpopular, compared to one-in-six (17%) women\n\nTo get more likes, 32% of men said they'd post something funny about a friend, compared to 21% of women\n\nWhat do you think about this study? Do you notice social media taking a toll in your relationships?",
      "Rodrigo Duterte's rise in opinion polls ahead of presidential elections on 9 May represents potentially the most serious crisis of Philippine democracy since 'people power' overthrew the Marcos dictatorship 30 years ago. Julio C Teehankee and Mark R Thompson outline why.\n\nNearly two years ago in these pages, several New Mandala contributors questioned Indonesian presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto's commitment to democracy (or more specifically his threats to undermine it). Prabowo, one of the most repressive high ranking generals in the Suharto dictatorship, narrowly lost the July 2014 presidential elections in Indonesia to Joko Widodo, who, although a disappointment to many of his supporters, has not posed a significant threat to the country's democratic institutions as president.\n\nNow it is the Philippines turn to have a major neo-authoritarian presidential candidate. Davao City Mayor Rodrigo 'Digong' Duterte, who the latest Pulse Asia national opinion shows leading a field of four major presidential candidates with about a third of the vote (which would translate into a comfortable 5 million vote lead over his nearest rival in a multi-candidate race), has shown little regard for the archipelago's (often fragile) democratic institutions. His coarse language and outrageous statements have recently surfaced in the international media, notably his tacit approval for the use of 'extrajudicial' killings to 'cleanse' the country of criminals and drug lords in three to six months, and, most notoriously, his recent casually insensitive, misogynous remark concerning the rape and murder of a female missionary in Davao.\n\nHe uses his record as mayor of the once rough and tumble city of Davao in the southern island of Mindanao as his calling card in the campaign. He claims he pacified the once dangerous city after he went after drug gangs, murderers and other criminals. He has shrugged off critics' accusations that he used death squads to achieve his goal, promising to implement his Davao model nationwide and daring human rights activists to stand in his way. He has threatened to abolish Congress and tame the courts if they do not prove cooperative with his radical plans to implement peace and order.\n\nIn another recent development, and according to the same electoral survey, Ferdinand 'Bongbong' R Marcos Jr, the son of the dictator Ferdinand E Marcos, is now narrowly ahead in the race for the vice presidency, which is elected separately in the Philippines, with victors often coming from different parties than the president. This is an ominous sign, adding to the neo-authoritarian danger facing the country as Marcos refuses to apologise for the crimes of his father's regime — both its human rights violations and economic plunder which he flat-out denies.\n\nFrom populism to neo-authoritarianism\n\nDuterte's unorthodox campaign style has captured the imagination of Filipino voters. His political back story runs parallel with the archetypical Filipino populist, ousted president Joseph \"Erap\" Estrada. Both come from middle-class families with minor political connections who found affinity with the poor at an early age. Both were expelled from Jesuit-run schools, and both started their careers as successful mayors: Erap during the Marcos era, Digong during the post-Marcos era. Both projected a \"siga\" (tough guy) image — Erap magnifying this persona in the movies and in the Metro Manila town (later city) of San Juan, and Digong crafting this image in the communist infiltrated and crime infested city of Davao.\n\nEstrada, however, managed to rise earlier from local to national politics: having been elected Mayor of San Juan in the late 1960s shortly before martial law and then to the Senate in 1987, as vice president in 1992, and as president in 1998. Digong, on the other hand, spent most of his political career in Davao (except for a short stint in Congress from 2001-2004). While Erap was viewed suspiciously by elites but enjoyed tremendous popularity among poor voters, Duterte's electoral appeal has been strongest among upper- and middle-class voters.\n\nDuterte's calls for a federal system draws on 'anti-Imperial Manila' sentiments, particularly in Mindanao. Besides this strong regional base (which extends into parts of the Visayas islands in the middle of the country) he strongly appeals to voters within Manila itself where his calls for a brutal and immediate implementation of a 'law and order' have resonated particularly well.\n\nGiven that Duterte has his strongest base in the elite and the middle class, his campaign is distinct from the pro-poor populism of Estrada and of one of his current electoral rivals for the presidency Jejomar 'Jojo' Binay –who before becoming Vice President was long-serving mayor of the Metro Manila city of Makati where he was noted for his welfare measures directed at the disadvantaged. Duterte's emerging neo-authoritarian constituency was initially concentrated among the elite, and middle class and only recently has moved down the social ladder. Duterte is the candidate of",
      "\"Intellectual honesty isn't just refraining from lying,\" says UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh in the newest Reason Podcast. \"It's mentioning the arguments against you and explaining why you think that they're mistaken, as opposed to just omitting them, hoping that the audience isn't going to catch on.\"\n\nVolokh is the founder of The Volokh Conspiracy, \"one of the most widely read legal blogs in the United States\" [which] \"has more influence in the field—and more direct impact—than most law reviews.\" The blog is written by mostly libertarian and libertarian-leaning law professors and court watchers, so we're excited as hell at Reason to now be hosting the Volokh Conspiracy on our website. It will remain editorially independent from Reason, though all of our readers will find much of interest and value in its content, which ranges from in-depth yet accessible glosses on the most important legal cases of the moment to disquisitions on pop culture.\n\nVolokh explained to me a few weeks ago that the blog began chafing under its home at The Washington Post partly because of that publication's paywall and partly because the newspaper would censor curse words even when they appeared in court documents that Volokh conspiracists were analyzing. When Volokh suggested Reason.com would be a good home for the blog, I instantly agreed, only adding that we would insist on publishing curse words even when they weren't strictly necessary.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview about The Volokh Conspiracy, Volokh discussed the site's aims, why he thinks the government is sometimes right to force business owners to serve customers they don't like, and his high opinion (so far) of Donald Trump's appointments to the federal judiciary. In an age of deep polarization and intellectually mendacious debates, the Volokh Conspiracy remains a straight shooter when it comes to pursuing what its contributors see as the truth. \"I hope even our libertarian readers appreciate that,\" says Volokh, \"because then they know that when we do take a view that they agree with more, that's because we really, sincerely believe it and think it's the best argument, and sometimes perhaps they see that there are some points in which conservatives, or even liberals or moderates, might be more correct than the libertarian orthodoxy.\"\n\nAudio production by Ian Keyser.\n\nSubscribe, rate, and review the Reason Podcast at iTunes.

He's a UCLA law professor and perhaps better known as the proprietor of The Volokh Conspiracy, a long-running legal group blog that I am excited to announce is coming to Reason.com. After being its own site and then being perched at The Washington Post for a long time, it is now coming to Reason.com. Eugene, thanks so much for talking to us.\n\nEugene Volokh: Thank you very much for talking to me.\n\nGillespie: Let's talk about The Volokh Conspiracy, which is obviously the premier group legal blog on the planet, I'm willing to say. There are, I guess, certain parts of Africa and some of the 'Stan' countries, I'm not familiar with their law blogs, but I'm pretty sure that The Volokh Conspiracy is still big there, too. What is the aim of The Volokh Conspiracy, for listeners or readers of Reason who may not be fully familiar with it?\n\nVolokh: Sure. We're mostly law professors, and we blog mostly about law. We also blog about whatever we please. Part of the aim is to have fun, for us to have fun, but the way we have fun is by talking to the public and often hearing back, and then talking back in the comments and in follow-up posts. Mostly, it's about stuff that we know a good deal about, which is to say American law. Some of us are experts on criminal law, some on First Amendment law, some on gun policy, some on business law, and often there are things in the news, whether it's new cases or new controversies, that we actually have something to say that's basically specialized knowledge that a lot of our readers find interesting. We, of course, have our own opinions, but we try to be objective and fair-minded about these things.\n\nGillespie: Well, you have points of view, right, but you are scrupulously fair. You strive to be scrupulously fair in your argumentation. Right? You don't miss ... I mean, it's",
      "Color me confused. Everyone on TV seems to be buying the line that the Goss resignation has been planned for weeks. No natural curiosity about the fact that it takes effect immediately, or that there is no replacement, or that he had a meeting scheduled this afternoon he didn't show up for. Not to mention the fact that as Professor Foland pointed out in the comments, the White House would've probably sacrificed its collective left nut to avoid stepping on a drunk Kennedy story.\n\nBut has the entire press corps turned into such a pile of humorless prudes that they can't connect the dots in the Brent Wilkes hooker scandal?\n\nFrom the Wall Street Journal on April 27:\n\nMr. Wade in February pleaded guilty to giving bribes of more than $1 million to Mr. Cunningham, including cash, antiques and payment for yachts. Mr. Wade, who hasn't been sentenced yet, is cooperating with prosecutors. According to people with knowledge of the investigation, Mr. Wade told investigators that Mr. Cunningham periodically phoned him to request a prostitute, and that Mr. Wade then helped to arrange for one. A limousine driver then picked up the prostitute as well as Mr. Cunningham, and drove them to one of the hotel suites, originally at the Watergate Hotel, and subsequently at the Westin Grand.\n\nThen it got a bit jucier in Harpers:\n\nThe two defense contractors who allegedly bribed Cunningham, said the Journal, were Brent Wilkes, the founder of ADCS Inc., and Mitchell Wade, the founder of MZM Inc.; both firms profited greatly from their connections with Cunningham. The Journal also suggested that other lawmakers might be implicated. I've learned from a well-connected source that those under intense scrutiny by the FBI are current and former lawmakers on Defense and Intelligence committees—including one person who now holds a powerful intelligence post.\n\nA powerful intelligence post? Who could that be? TPM Muckracker speculated, because it would've been irresponsible not to:\n\nAfter a long series of off-the-record phone calls with CIA spokespeople, I was finally given an on-the-record comment — about Goss. Speaking on behalf of the director, CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise Dyck said, \"This is horribly irresponsible. He hasn't even been to the Watergate in decades.\" When I asked if Goss had attended Wilkes' parties at the Westin or other locations, Millerwise Dyck repeated the denial. \"It's horribly irresponsible. Flatly untrue.\"\n\nLet's see. Jennifer Millerwise Dyck, spokeswoman for Dick Cheney from 2001-2003, who has been questioned by Fitzgerald about \"the vice president's knowledge of the anti-Wilson campaign and his dealings on it with Libby, his chief of staff.\" I see she's moved on to greener pastures. That settles that then.\n\nOr maybe not. Laura Rozen quotes a reader:\n\n\"Dana Priest is on MSNBC right now saying we'll have to wait for tomorrow's paper to find out why he resigned. The Post must have called him for comment on a story running tomorrow about his involvement with Brent Wilkes.\"\n\nPourquoi Brent Wilkes? Says Josh Marshall :\n\nWilkes has deep ties into the CIA. The focal point of those ties is to Kyle \"Dusty\" Foggo, the man Porter Goss appointed to the #3 position at CIA when he took over the Agency last year. Remember, Wilkes' scam was getting corrupt contracts deep in the 'black' world of intelligence and defense appropriations, where there's little or no oversight. Foggo was in the contracting and procurement field at the CIA. So you can see how he and Wilkes, who have been friends since high school, had plenty to talk about.\n\nLack of oversight…hmmm….well the Bush Administration is certainly the perfect petri dish for that, given their knee-jerk response to getting oversighted.\n\nAnd how did Goss make the acquaintance of Foggo?\n\nThat's how we get into the other part of this story — those 'hospitality suites', that moveable feast of food, poker and love, Brent Wilkes ran in Washington for maybe fifteen years. We hear that's how Goss got to be friends with Foggo, whom he later promoted to executive director of the CIA, the number 3 post at the Agency.\n\nFoggo admitted to be part of the Wilkes festivities, though he says there were no hookers. PJ O'Rourke will no doubt vouch for him.\n\nTime for some talking heads to develop a little natural curiosity. Hell we know he didn't get the boot for incompetence, lying or corruption, that would be unprecedented.\n\nScandal fatigue may finally be working against them.\n\n(graphic courtesy wonkydonkey at Kos )",
      "DRYER: Her lack of knowledge gave her away\n\nKayti Ella Dryer, 23, had already sparked the interest of officials as she sauntered through Customs with her black golf bag slung over her shoulder, a court heard. Prosecutors said Dryer looked uneasy with the sporting equipment when she arrived at Manchester ­Airport after what she described as \"a golf holiday\" in the Caribbean. When Customs officers quizzed her about her game, inquiring what handicap she played off, she stared back at them and then replied: \"But I'm not handicapped. I'm not ­disabled at all.\" Manchester Crown Court heard that her hollowed-out golf clubs were later found to be carrying 2.2lb (1kg) of Class A cocaine with a street value of £83,000. Her ignorance of basic golf knowledge led her to admit smuggling the drugs. She is now starting a four year jail term after admitting importing cocaine. An airport source said: \"When asked about her handicap she looked blank and asked them to repeat the question. They asked her again and she gave no response.\n\n\"She clearly did not know what they were talking about and had no idea it was even a golfing term.\" The court was told how officers had quizzed her after they noticed something suspicious when her golf bag was x-rayed in April. Unemployed Dryer, of Lewes, in East Sussex, was flying back to Manchester from Jamaica.She had travelled with her own bag of clubs and when they were put through the X-ray machine, some shadows from the bag alerted staff. Mike O'Grady, of HM Revenue and Customs, said the trained staff immediately became suspicious and it quickly became obvious that Dryer was trying to hide something. He said: \"When Dryer was asked questions about golf, it was clear that she was totally unfamiliar with the game and she had no legitimate reason for travelling with the sports equipment.\" After swabbing her luggage, tests revealed traces of cocaine. Officers then drilled into the bag and found the stash of drugs.",
      "BoJack Horseman.\n\nThe most structurally dazzling and heartbreaking comedy on TV is an animated show about a talking horse. Nobody could have imagined typing that sentence, much less reading it, three years ago, when Netflix debuted Raphael Bob-Waksberg's half-hour cartoon BoJack Horseman, a showbiz satire set in an alternate universe where humans and anthropomorphic animals coexist. But here we are. The show's fourth season is not just its best, it's the finest single season of a comedy in ages, though the persistent melancholy and focus on shame and guilt mark it as a comedy-drama: As the hero, BoJack (Will Arnett), a former sitcom star and sex-addicted alcoholic, would put it, it's \"not funny ha-hah but funny 'Doonesbury.' \" (It's also funny Mad Men: The title character's sour charisma, addictive tendencies, and deep self-loathing are Don Draper–esque.) BoJack's first three seasons were strong as well, always clever and fitfully brilliant, and certain episodes were gobsmackingly original. My favorite up to now was season three's \"Fish Out of Water,\" which sent BoJack to an underwater film festival where non-fish had to wear diving helmets; all the scenes set at the festival were essentially animated silent cinema.\n\nBut there was always more to BoJack than the seeming one-joke broadness of its premise. (It's like The Larry Sanders Show, or Episodes, but with animals!) In season four, the show's interest in psychology merges with its other concerns in an organic, fully realized way, restating its belief that even people who think of themselves as broken or worthless deserve a shot at happiness — and can achieve it if they're willing to commit selfless acts and realize that other people's lives matter as much as their own. The show avoids returning to the Byronic cliffs of despair where it left BoJack at the ends of seasons two and three (which concluded with an ill-advised tryst with a teenager and a former co-star's drug overdose, respectively). Season four serves up two endings in its last couple of episodes: one bleak, the other hopeful. BoJack installs his elderly mother, Beatrice (Wendie Malick), a profoundly damaged woman who was never capable of showing him love and is now suffering from dementia, in a shabby Michigan nursing home, geographically as well as figuratively turning his back on her. Concurrently, though, BoJack expends great effort trying to locate the birth mother of Hollyhock (Aparna Nancherla), the teenager who claims to be his daughter. His heroic quest resolves in a moving finale that evokes season seven of Mad Men, which likewise insisted that a depressive, substance-­addicted narcissist could will himself a few steps closer to enlightenment without compelling forgiveness from the people he'd hurt or magically erasing his flaws.\n\nThese 12 episodes are more strongly serialized than any that have come before. Ongoing plotlines involving BoJack; his maybe-daughter, Hollyhock; his manager, Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris); his friends Mr.\n\nPeanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins) and Diane (Alison Brie); and other characters subtly mirror, reinforce, or deepen each other. As the season progresses, the show keeps returning to key situations or ideas with a deft confidence that is (yes, really) symphonic. At the same time, the writing staff gives each episode the shape of a good short story, making the series pleasurable viewing for those who prefer one-offs and have no intention of watching the whole thing. Bob-Waksberg and his collaborators always keep the show's potential for belly-laugh, slapstick satire within easy reach. They showcase it most fully in scenes dealing with BoJack's goofball sidekick Todd Chavez (Aaron Paul) and in a story line in which dimwit superstar dog Mr. Peanutbutter runs for California governor against incumbent Woodchuck Couldchuck-Berkowitz (Andre Braugher), an experienced, super-competent, but dull career politician who's furious that a charismatic but unqualified nimrod would dare run against him. (Sound like any presidential candidates you know?) Fakeness, deception, and self-deception are teased out in countless conversations and italicized in two key moments involving forged signatures on documents — all of which ties in with the self-castigating language of major characters, BoJack especially, who feel deep down that they're fake, that their feelings are fake, their achievements are based on fraudulence, that other people are lying when they say they love them, so why not drink until you pass out?\n\nThe wounding power of memory coupled with self-loathing, always a key strand of the series' DNA, is expressed most forcefully in BoJack's masochistic internal monologues (\"",

Ciarán has recorded a protest album alongside former Beta Band frontman Steve Mason, and poets Stephen Burke-Morrison and Hollie McNish.\n\nThe as-yet-untitled album will be released in the summer, but will be preceded by a series of singles that will coincide with the run towards the general election.\n\nThose aforementioned singles begin to emerge, symbolically on Wednesday, April 1, as Ciarán and poet Stephen Morrison-Burke castigate what they see as the fools in power.\n\nStand Up features the Super Furry Animal and last year's National Poetry Slam Champion Morrison-Burke coming together to decry the dissolution of social support services and privatisation of the NHS.\n\nSuper Furry Animals: The albums\n\nSecond release, Since I Was A Little Girl/End Game arrives on Wednesday, April 29.\n\nSince I Was A Little Girl embraces Hollie McNish's gift for say-as-you-see-it truths. Her ability to craft hard-hitting social commentaries have seen her YouTube views hit numbers in their millions, be invited to perform at the Glastonbury Festival and also become the first poet to record at Abbey Road.\n\nSharing the billing on the second release is End Game, where Strangetown Records regular (and collaborator with SFA drummer, Dafydd Ieuan) Rashid Omar aka Wibidi, voices his objection to the Trident programme.\n\nCompleting the pre-election trilogy is Don't Give It Away/Revolution Of The Mind/Womb To Urn, which will be released on Wednesday, May 6 – the day before the general election.\n\nDon't Give It Away sees Ciarán team up with Steve Mason for the song which carries with it a caustic message, calling the election a \"subsidised ego trip\" and \"grabbing them (politicians) by the throat\".\n\nRelated: Where and when can I see Super Furry Animals live in 2015?\n\nThe flipside Revolution of Mind has words from Louisa Roach of Liverpool-based outfit, She Drew the Gun – who count James Skelly of The Coral and Steve Lamacq as fans.\n\nRoach's words reveal a confused view of a broken and inhumane world.\n\nThe release is completed by Womb to Urn which features the emerging talent of 23-year-old Enbe, from Ely in Cardiff.\n\nSpeaking about the project, Ciarán said: \"What has happened in established politics is nothing short of criminal, testing my faith in humanity.\n\n\"We see blatant, systematic rebalancing of the books, favouring private greed over public wealth, to ensure the deserving majority is left with nothing in favour of an immoral minority.\n\n\"The coalition has worked harder to protect this imbalance than anyone could have imagined, ruling through deception and fear. This is our response to those injustices and, in writing and releasing the tracks, ask that voters consider whether members of the political and business elite really have their best interests at heart.\"",
      "This photo of the November 2006 transit of Mercury shows the rocky planet as a clean-edged disc in the lower hemisphere of the sun. Sunspots can also be seen near the right and left edges of the sun.\n\nAmateur astronomer and retired chemistry teacher Patricia Totten Espenak has published a book about the 2017 Great American Eclipse called \"Total Eclipse or Bust! A Family Road Trip.\" She is the wife of retired astrophysicist and NASA eclipse expert Fred Espenak.\n\n\"It's cold; it's dark; it's time for astronomy.\" That might be what you think when it comes to viewing the stars and planets, but all those denizens of the night don't stop spinning when the sun rises and smothers everything in brilliant light.\n\nThe other stars and planets drift overhead, on a schedule that has nothing to do with night and day on Earth, and on May 9, 2016, there will once again be a chance to see Mercury march across the sun's brilliant disk. The last time this happened was in 2006, so this is not a frequent event. [The Mercury Transit of 2016: How to See It & What to Expect]\n\nThis NASA graphic shows the timing of a few major events during the Mercury transit of May 9, 2016. Credit: NASA\n\nBecause a telescope and solar filter are required to view it, the 2016 transit of Mercury will happen, as many have, unseen by most of Earth's inhabitants. But at least light pollution is not a factor. If it's daytime where you are in the United States and parts of Europe, you have a chance to see Mercury silhouetted against the sun. A nearby observatory might have a viewing for the public. (Warning: Never look directly at the sun without proper eye protection; blindness may result. Read about how to safely observe the Mercury transit here.)\n\nDuring the transit, you can marvel at how small Mercury is and how fast it moves. The innermost planet will march fiercely across the sun, and the true scale of the solar system will be revealed. Mercury will be just a speck moving across the solar disk. You'll wonder how it survives.\n\nIf Earth were placed in Mercury's orbit, it would look only about 2.5 times larger than Mercury does. Our home planet is pretty insignificant on the scale of the solar system, too.\n\nFor observers in the western United States, the transit will already be in progress when the sun rises. To see the entire event, you must be east of a line that passes roughly from eastern South Dakota through eastern Louisiana. If a sunspot or two happen to grace us with their presence on transit day, then watching Mercury glide past these magnetic storms could be captivating.\n\nSince the invention of the telescope 400 years ago, there have been only 55 Mercury transits, and only about two-thirds of them would have been visible from the United States. So as you watch this leisurely celestial ballet, revel in the rarity of the event, and think of astronomers in days of yore, who sometimes traveled halfway around the world to witness such a sight.\n\nOn May 9, 2016, Mercury will cross the face of the sun as seen from most of the Earth. This NASA map shows where the rare Transit of Mercury will be visible from, weather permitting. Credit: Science@NASA\n\nAfter viewing my first transit of Mercury in 1999, I asked, \"When's the next one?\" In this case, we're in luck, because the next transit of Mercury visible in the U.S. will occur in 2019. After that, there are transits in 2032 and 2039, but those will not be visible from the United States. Observers in the U.S. will have to wait until 2049 for another chance, so don't miss this one.\n\nYou probably won't have to travel far to view this transit of Mercury, and perhaps it will whet your appetite to chase other astronomical events around the planet. At the very least, it might make you more aware of all those starry dancers silently swirling overhead, both night and day.\n\nEditor's note: Visit Space.com on Monday to see live webcast views of the rare Mercury transit from Earth and space, and for complete coverage of the celestial event.

This product has a lovely consistency and spreads nicely over my skin. Other high SPF products tend to be thicker in consistency and have a white residue. This is perfect.

But after a long career, the highly entertaining Superstar will receive sports-entertainment's biggest honor. As first reported by Bleacher Report, he is the latest inductee in the WWE Hall of Fame's Class of 2016. JBL and 2012 inductee Ron Simmons will be on hand to induct him.\n\nThe Godfather's Hall of Fame profile | Photos | Video highlights | Full WWE Hall of Fame coverage\n\nRemembered most to WWE audiences as a fun-loving staple of the Attitude Era, The Godfather's journey to the Hall of Fame was certainly one wild train ride.\n\nIn the late '90s he was most recognizable for being the muscle of The Nation of Domination, but as that group began to slowly disband, The Godfather seemingly began to have more and more women accompany him to ringside every week.\n\nThis trend continued after The Nation officially split and The Godfather quickly transitioned into one of the WWE Universe's most beloved Superstars, both for his attractive supporting cast and for his enigmatic charisma and charm.\n\nThe Godfather went on to have memorable interactions with everyone from Mark Henry to Triple H as the Monday Night War raged on. The Godfather's unique persona and lovely ladies were a key ingredient in giving WWE, and the Attitude Era specifically, a very distinct flavor and feel. From his colorful outfits, to memorable theme song, entourage of gorgeous ladies and hard-hitting offense, The Godfather never failed to make an impression.\n\nThe Godfather captured the Intercontinental Championship as a singles competitor, as well as the World Tag Team Championship, though he underwent a personality change in the process. For a brief period of time in the early 2000s, The Godfather ditched his upbeat, controversial persona, to join the ultra-conservative Right to Censor, taking on the name of The Goodfather. This metamorphosis would not last for long, though, and The Godfather would soon return in spectacular fashion.\n\nEven today, The Godfather and his massive following of beautiful women still pop up on WWE television from time-to-time. It may be infrequent, but when it does happen, one thing is certain, the WWE Universe gleefully cheers, \"All aboard!\"\n\nDon't miss The Godfather's train pull into the WWE Hall of Fame on the eve of WrestleMania 32, Saturday, April 2!",
      "You'd think he'd be terrifying. Hideki Kamiya, the creator of Devil May Cry, Bayonetta and Okami, has a persona that has come to light through his brilliantly candid and often terse Twitter outbursts and has been cultivated since before he got into games: there's a famous photo of a young Kamiya in a leather biker jacket, holding a Union Jack-gloved fist to his chest while a relative dressed in pink, perhaps his mother, stands politely beside him.\n\nSo you'd forgive me for being a little intimidated before sitting down with Kamiya a handful of days after reviews for his latest creation The Wonderful 101 have hit, and for having fears that any question I pitched that wasn't to his liking would be batted away with trademark pithiness. His press demonstrations, sometimes conducted in silence and only punctuated by occasional nods of approval from Kamiya, have become modest legends, his Twitter takedowns artfully harsh.\n\nKamiya, being generally amazing.\n\nBut in person, Kamiya's a pussycat. With shades perched on top of his closely shaved scalp and a promotional t-shirt spread across his wide frame, Kamiya sits attentively on the edge of a faux leather sofa giving thoughtful, measured answers (though I still daren't ask whether Bayonetta will be in Smash Bros.).\n\nThis isn't the scathing Kamiya who is ready to tear through fans, and there's not even the hard-edged, hardcore posturing that's defined so much of his work. Instead, this is Kamiya as he most likely really is, the softly spoken Nintendo fanboy who as a child queued up from 4am one cold New Year in the city of Matsumoto to get his hands on a Famicom, his first ever console.\n\nThis is the Kamiya who still has a wide-eyed love for video games, and who spends his time outside of work tracking down arcade boards to plug into his cabinet at home, where he pounds away on his prized possession, an original Gradius board. (\"It cost a pretty penny,\" Kamiya says with pride. \"I've got two of them, and I'll probably take them to my grave.\") Kamiya's always had a soft spot for Nintendo - his iPhone's on the table before us wrapped in a case that mimics the iconic Famicom controller - and it was the Kyoto outfit that first sparked his desire to turn a passion for playing games into a talent for making them. Having failed to pass his high school entrance exam, it's the first place he applied to work for, although there's an element of Kamiya altering his story for the situation - when promoting Bayonetta he'd often say that it was Sega he first turned to.\n\nRegardless of which version of that story's the truth, the love for Nintendo shines through in moments of The Wonderful 101, Platinum Games' first appearance on the Wii U. Just as Bayonetta had colourful nods to OutRun and Space Harrier, so too are there allusions to the many universes Nintendo's built, from the cameo of a Hylian shield to extended riffs on Punch Out. There was a time in the development of Wonderful 101 that the references weren't quite so subtle.\n\n\"Tatsuya Minami [Platinum Games' president and CEO] came to me with a request to create a game composed of an all-star cast including some Nintendo characters and some all-star characters,\" recalls Kamiya. \"I wondered how I could satisfy all the fans and all the characters, and I wondered how I could create something that would fascinate all the fans of all the characters, so I thought why don't we put them all on screen at the same time? That was where the core concept that later turned into The Wonderful 101 came from.\"\n\nKamiya's Gradius board doesn't even have the bubble memory of the original run intact, so he can hardly call himself hardcore.\n\nThe concept never came off and Kamiya went to work on another project, but when that stalled he decided to return to the original idea and get together a working demo on PC. The Nintendo characters had been ditched in favour of superheroes inspired by the likes of Kamen Rider - and lots of them. \"That style of hero I find really interesting - usually it's just limited to five people or so, but with 100 of them they're impossible to defeat,\" says Kamiya. Their ability to morph together also drew inspiration from another childhood favourite, Dutch author Leo Linni's Swimmy, in which a school of fish combines to make one giant fish.\n\nThe Wonderful 101 was at first platform agnostic, though it was always slated to appear on a Nintendo machine. \"I started thinking of ideas before thinking it was necessarily for any particular hardware,\" says Kamiya. \"Once we showed it to Nintendo again and we reached an agreement - but we were never really thinking about a particular console at all.\"\n\n\"Before",

      "Police in north London have seized blankets, sleeping bags and food donations from rough sleepers in a crackdown on homelessness.\n\nA local paper reported that the belongings, mostly donated by sympathetic members of the community, were snatched by police from a group of homeless people as they sheltered in an abandoned public baths for the night.\n\nThe nine people, including a man in his sixties, were seeking cover from a cold night in Redbridge and were left stunned when their worldly possessions disappeared into the back of a police car.\n\nOne of the men targeted in the action, Adam Jaskowiak, pleaded with officers to be allowed to keep his possessions for warmth. The 34-year-old said: \"They [the police officers] were just taking the sleeping bags and chucking out everything. I asked to keep it, and the food, but they said 'No'.\n\n\"I just grabbed as many of my things as possible and put them into a bag and ran.\"\n\nPolice later confirmed that the shocking intervention was part of a co-ordinated effort to \"reduce the negative impact of rough sleepers\".\n\nChief Inspector John Fish told the Ilford Recorder: \"The public rely on the police to reduce the negative impact; this includes the need for us to assist in the removal of tents and bedding from public spaces and other inappropriate locations.\"\n\nIn response, Joanne McCartney, chair of the Police and Crime Committee at the Greater London Assembly, has written to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner asking for an explanation for the seizure.\n\nHer letter, seen by The Independent, raises doubts over the legality of the police's approach and asks Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe on whose authority the officers acted.\n\n\"These are the most vulnerable people in society and they have to be offered assistance,\" Mrs McCartney said. \"To take someone's only source of food and warmth seems to be extremely draconian and misguided to say the least.\"\n\nThe move has also sparked outrage from the voluntary sector. Rita Chadha, head of the Refugee and Migrant Forum of East London, said the move was dangerous as well as confusing. \"We are going through one of the coldest summers we have ever had, it's a strong possibility that someone could die,\" she said.",
      "Fatwa regarding Freemasonry MUSLIM VIEW College of Islamic Jurisprudence, Makkah, 15th July 1978 by Farooq The College of Islamic Jurisprudence considers Freemasonry one of the most dangerously destructive organisations to Islam and to Muslims. The full text of the Fatwa is as follows: College of Islamic Jurisprudence, Makkah, 15th July 1978 - concerning: Freemasonry \"The College of Islamic Jurisprudence, in its session convened at Makkah on 15th July 1978, examined the issue of Freemasonry, of those affiliated with it and the legal Islamic judgment on it, after adequate study of this dangerous organisation, and the boy of literature on it, inclusive of the College's own published documents, books, and newspaper and journal articles.\n\n\nFrom the totality of writings and texts which the College examined, the following was evinced: Freemasonry is a clandestine organisation, which hides as well as reveals it operations as it sees fit. Its true principles are guarded from all but its most venerated masters, who have, by virtue of their consecration at Freemasonry's highest order degrees, proven worth of this honour. It establishes the relation of its members one to another, in all places of the earth, as is the alleged human brotherhood among all entrants in its organisation, without discrimination as to race, religion, and creed. Such overt misrepresentation of \"fraternity\" is simple-minded, at best. It attracts persons whose affiliation is practicable for the organisation; its allure is largely of a personally lucrative nature for the individuals sought. The high-minded principles of this recruitment entail; pledged assistance to any Freemasonic brother the world over; firm support of any Freemasonic candidacy to public office; and unconditional loyalty in all Freemasonic endeavors, even in those where the individual must compromise his sense of honour, justice, truth and right. Such lofty appeals often amass considerable financial contributions. Admission to Freemasonry is based on the celebration of the new member's affiliation through symbolic and awe-inspiring ceremonies which serve to frighten the initiate if he is at variance with the instructions; the more threatening orders are issued successively with rank. Gullible members are left free in the exercise of their religious beliefs; if they do not choose to benefit from the directives of guidance and the assignment of task appropriate to their status ( they remain in lower degrees.\n\nAs to the heretics, rank is calibrated in relation to individual experience and mastery, as well as demonstrated readiness to serve Freemasonry's purposes, principles, and plans. It has political aims, and in most political and military upheavals, it has a visible, as well as an invisible, role. Its original organisational roots are Jewish; its secret global high administration, Jewish; and its activity, Zionist. In its secret real aims, it is against all religions: in general it seeks to destroy Islam for its Muslim adherents. It strives to select its membership from among positions of influence - financial, political, social or scientific status ( and to draw to its ranks kings, presidents and ministers, as tools to be manipulated in the forging of its dogma. It has branches which adopt other names to thus misrepresent and divert attention away from activities which encounter resistance to the name of Freemasonry. Among the most conspicuous branches operating under pseudonym are the Lions and Rotary Clubs; many, under multiple guise, similarly contradict the fundamentals of Islam. It has become evident to the College of Islamic Jurisprudence the strong relation of Freemasonry to world Zionist Jewry. Thus it has been able to dominate many officials in the Arab countries concerning the question of Palestine, and to interfere in the Palestine question on behalf of the Jews and world Zionism. Therefore, and for the detailed data on Freemasonry's activity, its considerable danger, its wicked dressing and its cunning aims, the College of Islamic Jurisprudence considers Freemasonry one of the most dangerously destructive organisations to Islam and to Muslims Whoever would associate himself with it while in knowledge of its true nature and aims, would be a non-believer in Islam and uncounted among its adherents.\" Source: Fatwa reproduced in \"Freemasonry\", by Muhammad Safwat al-Saqqa Amini and Sa'di Abu Habib. back to top",
      "How SME funding risk is allocated\n\nGiorgio Barba Navaretti, Giacomo Calzolari, Alberto Pozzolo\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises are supposed to be the key to growth, everywhere. These enterprises are risky, and when they are so important to the well-being of an economy, someone must bear the risk of funding them. This column argues that there is a real need for policymakers to focus on how we finance SMEs, as getting the institutions and structures right can pay dividends in the long run.\n\nIn recent years, the debate around small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and how to finance them has become a crucial policy concern. SMEs account for a very large share of employment and GDP in all economies and, as most great things start small, they are key ingredients of growth prospects everywhere (e.g. WEF 2015). At the same time, they are risky and, in the aggregate, they sum up to a large fraction of banks' lending. Finding the right balance between supporting SMEs and their expansion and at the same time containing and efficiently spreading the risk of financing them is difficult. It has been even more so during the long years of the financial crisis and the consequent tightening of financial regulation and prudential requirements. In the second issue of European Economy - Banks, Regulation and the Real Sector several authors discuss how to deal with this complex trade-off.\n\nThe starting question is of course why there is a need for financing SMEs and why this is so sensitive from the point of view of policy. There is a static and a dynamic approach to this question. The static one is about the existence and the survival of a large share of the domestic economy in all countries. More than 99% of all firms in the EU are SMEs and they account for 66.9% of total employment (Figure 1). SMEs are also a pretty heavy load on banks' balance sheets – new loans to SMEs were around 27% of new loans to non-financial corporations in the Eurozone, with peaks at around 40% for Italy and Spain (Figure 2). The dynamic perspective is about favouring the reallocation of resources towards fast-growing enterprises. For example, start-ups plus fast-growing young firms historically have accounted for about 70% of gross US job creation annually (Haltiwanger 2014). But if most large firms start small, not all firms become large – about 50% of private firms born in the US in 2009, and about 30% of US firms that were already five-years old in 2009, had exited the market by 2014 (DeYoung et al. 2015, De Young 2015).\n\nFigure 1. SMEs role in selected European countries\n\nSource: European Commission, Annual Report on European SMEs. According to the EU recommendation 2003/361, firms with less than 250 employees and an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million € (or a balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euros) are classified as SMEs.\n\nFigure 2. New loans to SMEs as a share of total new corporate loans\n\nSource: ECB Statistical Data Warehouse. 12-month moving average of the value of new loans to SMEs (new business, of value up to and including 1 million €) to total new loans to non-financial corporations.\n\nIf SMEs are crucial both in static and dynamic terms, financial market imperfections hinder their ability to survive and expand. The keyword (a well-known one, but frequently elapsing in policy propositions advocating unlimited and unconditional support for SMEs) is market failure – if financial markets were functioning adequately, we would not have an SME issue. Asymmetric information between financial institutions and firms restricts financing opportunities and the matching between demand and supply, especially for SMEs which are more opaque than large firms. Moreover, the implications for financial markets are quite different depending on whether we consider smallness as a persistent or a transient state of affairs – younger firms, that tend to be smaller for obvious reasons, are even more opaque for banks. In fact, signalling profitability and riskiness takes time, making adverse selection stronger for younger and thus smaller firms.\n\nMarket failures cannot not only generate an inefficient amount of financing, but also a wrong allocation away from the most deserving borrowers – SMEs have no right to funding just because they are such. Solving market failures precisely means finding ways for being efficiently selective, for example nurturing young and small firms with fast growth opportunities. Many proposals and best practices have been discussed for fostering and supporting SMEs, but no all-encompassing optimal solutions exist (Barba Navaretti et al. 2015).\n\nThese concerns become even more critical under severe negative systemic shocks. SMEs became especially topical in the long years of the financial plus sovereign crisis. Indeed, several indicators show a higher level of distress for these companies, particularly at the peak of the Global Crisis – a much higher share of non-performing loans over total loans (Figure 3",

The game will be on ABC.\n\nSpartans coach Mark Dantonio will look to avenge a 24-21 overtime road defeat to Indiana last year, his first loss against the Hoosiers as head coach. No. 21 Michigan State enters this week at 4-1 (2-0 Big Ten), while Big Ten West foe Indiana comes in at 3-2 (0-2). Michigan State will head to Minnesota this weekend, while the Hoosiers will host the Michigan team the Spartans just beat.\n\nAfter that, they will meet in East Lansing.\n\nMichigan State-Indiana Week 8 date, game time\n\nTime: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nDate: Saturday, Oct. 21\n\nLocation: Spartan Stadium, East Lansing, Mich.\n\nTelevision: ABC\n\nMichigan State-Indiana series history\n\nMichigan State and Indiana met three times before 1949, when the Big Ten admitted the Spartans to the conference. Indiana won three of those meetings, with the other being a tie.\n\nSince 1949, though, The Spartans have held a convincing 45-13-1 advantage in the series. Before the 2016 loss, Dantonio had won all seven of his meetings with the Hoosiers as head coach.\n\nLast year's loss, though, was the Spartans' second of the season and an early part of the downfall that ended with a 3-9 record. Michigan State led 14-0 late in the third quarter but could not hold on. Offensive production was remarkably close in the game, with the Spartans edging Indiana, 438-437.\n\nOfficially, Michigan State last lost twice in a row to Indiana in 1993-94. However, the latter of those games was initially won by Michigan State but had to be forfeited as a result of an investigation into grade tampering. Before that, the Spartans hadn't lost consecutive games to the Hoosiers since 1969.",

      "Good morning, welcome to NFL Free Agency Day II! Holy crap, if you, for some weird reason, didn't look at the internet yesterday, you missed a lot. Here's a quick recap to get you up to speed.\n\nNFC West\n\nThe West was relatively quiet apart from losing a bunch of players. I'll get to that, but in terms of volume, the Niners made the most noise. After releasing CB Carlos Rogers, they traded a 6th round pick to the Jaguars to acquire physically gifted but so-far-failed-to-launch QB Blaine Gabbert, ostensibly to have him compete for the backup job behind Colin Kaepernick.\n\nThey also traded a 2015 conditional 7th round pick for Jonathan Martin (the condition being that Martin would need to make the 49ers roster out of camp), which makes this, essentially, a tryout. Regardless, even if he does make the roster, a future 7th round pick is about as valuable as a ham sandwich, so this is a nice move with some potential upside.\n\nMore importantly though, the Niners signed former Colts safety Antoine Bethea to a four-year deal that's worth $5-$6M per year, according to reports. He'll replace Donte Whitner (who left for the Browns) and pair with 2nd year safety Eric Reid in San Francisco's defensive secondary. Bethea is 29.\n\nThe Cardinals signed one of the bigger free agent left tackles on the market in Jared Veldheer. This is a nice move for Arizona, who can now pair him next to 2013 first round pick Jonathan Cooper. The Cardinals' left side should be very good in 2014, which should help their run game with Andre Ellington and can't hurt their pass game while keeping Carson Palmer upright. Awesome. Because the NFC West needed more good players.\n\nThe Cards also re-signed Frostee Rucker, which helps with their depth on the defensive line.\n\nThe Rams and Seahawks made no moves, but that may change on Wednesday.\n\nTE Jermichael Finley has a visit lined up with the Seahawks, and assuming he's healthy enough to play, the Hawks will likely offer him a one-year \"prove it\" deal to get him back on track after suffering a scary neck injury last year in Week 7. Finley missed the rest of the season and had to have two vertebrae fused, but his doctor has given him an excellent prognosis for full recovery.\n\nAs Field Gulls own Aaron Sims points out, the Seahawks' team doctor, Dr. Stanley Herring, specializes in concussions and spine injuries and chairs the NFL's Head, Neck and Spine Committee's Subcommittee on Advocacy and Education. So, as Sims says, if anyone is going to be able to assess Finley, it is him.\n\nRegardless, Finley is an enticing option whose value on the market is greatly diminished because of his injury. This is one avenue that the Seahawks have taken in years past and if Finley checks out medically, a one-year \"prove it\" deal with the man that drafted him in John Schneider might be just the ticket.\n\nFinley tweeted recently that he's up to 260 pounds at 10% body fat, and this is a significant increase from his reported playing weight of about 235 or so when he was more of a TE/WR hybrid in Green Bay in 2011-12. Does this mean he'd be ready to round his game out a little bit into the blocking realm? Perhaps, though I would assume Seattle sees him way more in the \"Joker\" role that they envisioned for Kellen Winslow when they traded for him a few years back, and before that, Jon Carlson, before he tore his labrum and missed the 2011 season.\n\nAs an anonymous scout told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel's Bob McGinn, \"If proven healthy and someone was looking for a pass catcher, he'd be a consideration. But he is not a fully dimensional, fully equipped tight end. You've got to have a role, a vision for him. If you look at the way Jared Cook played at St. Louis and is used that way, OK.\" The scout added, \"But he is not giving you anything in the running game. Some of that is want-to.\"\n\nAnd really, this is acceptable. The Seahawks still do have Zach Miller, recently re-signed Anthony McCoy, and Luke Willson on the roster. Assuming the Hawks do what they've reportedly planned to do and release Miller for cap savings, the combo of Willson and McCoy as the in-line Y tight ends would allow Finley to remain what he's been during his career -- a moveable chess piece.\n\nCable talked about this back in 2012, noting that when you have multiple versatile tight ends, you can run with two tight end sets and start dictating to the defense what you want to do.\n\n\"Zach Miller",
      "One of the world's poorest countries and ranked in the bottom 10 in the United Nation's human development index, Guinea Bissau caused a sensation in booking a place at the 16-team tournament in Gabon, where they will meet the hosts in the opening match in Libreville on Jan. 14.\n\nTeam co-ordinator Caito Balde says the side want to continue to surprise the footballing world at the finals and do what Portugal did in France in July.\n\n\"Portugal are an inspiration to us for what they did at the Euro 2016 in France. Many of the players in the Guinea Bissau team have played with many of those players who have now become champions of Europe. They have passed through the best training school that is Portugal and will look to show that at the Nations Cup,\" he said in an interview with the Portuguese news agency Lusa on Sunday.\n\nBut Guinea Bissau will still have to overcome serious problems if they are to make any impact, not least their haphazard preparations.\n\nPromised government support to pay for a training camp ahead of the tournament has not materialised. Instead a preliminary squad of 26 players has assembled at Bissau's national stadium daily since last Thursday for training, some sessions watched by up to 5 000 spectators.\n\nIt is still not known if a warm-up friendly will be organised for the team before they depart for Libreville next week.\n\nLong overdue appearance fees from the qualifying campaign had been paid on Friday, Balde said, but his plans to boost the squad with several players of Guinea Bissau extraction from around Europe had fallen through\n\n\"We called up some players who made a commitment that they would play, but at the last minute they went back on their word,\" he said.\n\nBut Balde has insisted the small west African country would field a strong team. \"We have assembled the best players from Guinea. They have been carefully selected.\"\n\nThe final 23-man squad will be named on Wednesday.\n\nGuinea Bissau, which had gained unwanted notoriety as a transit hub for cocaine smugglers and has been beset by frequent coup d'etats and almost constant political instability, made sure of a place in the finals by finishing ahead of former champions Zambia and Congo in their qualifying group.\n\nThey will become the 39th country to participate in the finals since the first tournament in 1957, but were a Leicester-like long shot when the preliminaries got underway, having only previously won four matches in Nations Cup and World Cup qualification combined since first entering international competition 23 years ago.",
      "An overview of the workflow I use for creating realistic 3D assets\n\n1. Agisoft\n\nAgisoft takes photos and turns them into 3D models. It uses a clever algorithm that will calculate the position of where the photos were taken based on common points in the photographs, then builds a point cloud, and that data is used to build a 3D mesh and project pixel data onto it.\n\nTaking the photos is the most important part of the process. For small objects (things that you can walk around ) you would normally use a turntable to place the object, and the camera will be on a tripod. Agisoft doesn't give any recommendations on how many photos to take as it will likely differ for each scenario. The important part is to take the photos with at least 50% overlap. For the body scanning I did (3D body scanning ) I've taken around 200 photographs. Generally, the more photos the better, but taking too many will just make the whole process too slow without any gain in terms of quality. For smaller and simpler objects you can get around with 20-30 photos. Also, do not use wide angle lens unless you really have to as the lens distortion will affect the outputted 3D model.\n\nFor isolated objects, you will probably need to do masking as well. Unfortunately, the masking tools Agisoft has are not automatic and it will be impossible to manually mask 200 photographs with their native tools. What I did was import all my images as a movie sequence in AfterEffects, colour key the green screen, create an alpha channel from the mask, and separate the frames back in photoshop, and imported the separate masks in Agisoft. There might be an easier way of doing this – I am just not aware of any at the moment.\n\nScanning environments is somewhat simpler. This is how Agisoft recommends capturing the photos:\n\nI found that in small interiors(a few square metres) is better to sit in a central position with the camera and only move up and down and slightly left and right, while rotating the camera to cover all angles. Again it is up to you how many photos to take, I've taken about 150 for this scan.\n\nThe settings in Agisoft are somewhat misleading. I found that at times, putting it on highest settings for the pairing of the photographs will give a worse result than on medium settings. I generally use medium settings for the pairing, high on building the point cloud and high on building the mesh.The more advanced settings I leave on default and sometimes try different settings and compare the results.When I have a mesh built, I build the texture (usually 10k) and export it to Zbrush.\n\n2. Zbrush\n\nI use Zbrush to do the retopology, cleanup and to generate maps. If the 3D model is not going to be animated (in which case you would need custom topology), then using the automated tool called ZRemesher will usually give decent results.The highest poly object you can bring in unity is 64k triangles, but you can also have a denser object which unity will split into parts on import. The environment I used in my last project, was around 80k; all other objects were 50k or less. All together I kept my scene under 200k so the scene can run smoothly. After doing the retopology and reprojected the detail from the high poly model, I export my new 3D model back to Agisoft and reproject the texture. That way you have a lighter 3D model, but the same 10k texture density. An important thing to remember is to not move the mesh from its original position when working on it outside of Agisoft otherwise you will not be able to project the texture back. I repeat this process if I need to do some more clean-up or cut out/add missing parts. Last thing in Zbrush is generating normal, cavity and specular maps and export.\n\n2mil poly mesh from Agisoft to 50k after retopology in Zbrush Normal map for transferring the high resolution detail to a low poly mesh High poly to low poly mesh\n\n3.Maya\n\nGoing through Maya is necessary for doing any animation, for aligning the 3D models, centering the pivots, and getting the right scale. Unity and Maya work well together and any changes in a Maya scene can be automatically updated in Unity.\n\n4.Unity\n\nIn Unity all there is left to do is set up the shader. With Unity 5, I mostly use the standard shader with normal and specular maps.UPDATE: Valve just released a plugin with shaders specifically designed for VR : link. For some 3D models I use the pre-integrated skin shader as it gives me more functionality. Opting for HDRI lighting like skyshop, will give much better results but there is the drawback of no real-time shadows. Make sure the textures are all set to 8k",

Photo: Supplied\n\nIf abolished, they would close the budget deficit four times over.\n\nThe statement was mandated to ensure that so-called tax expenditures received the same scrutiny as cash expenditures. The tax breaks on the family home cost the budget as much as the age pension and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme combined. Even after the recently leglislated cuts, the superannuation tax breaks cost the budget as much as defence and foreign aid combined.\n\nOften, government programs are arbitrarily defined as either cash or tax expenditures. The $6.5 billion private health insurance rebate was originally classified as a tax expenditure before being reclassified as a cash expense. The $19.3 billion family tax benefit is classified as a cash expenditure despite its name.\n\nThree of the 10 biggest tax expenditures relate to the goods and services tax. They are the exemptions for fresh food ($6.9 billion), for private education ($4.5 billion) and private health ($4 billion).

      "The patch notes for the Dota 2 7.07 update, \"Dueling Fates,\" fully reveals the new Pangolier and Dark Willow heroes who were teased back in August. The update will also make a big change to the matchmaking rating system, updates the Ability Draft, adds a new Dota Turbo game mode and Ping Wheel functionality, and changes the Guide System to make it more accessible and useful.\n\nDonté Panlin, the Pangolier, is a dashing, Puss in Boots-style swordsman, but instead of a cat he's a sort of anthropomorphic pangolin, with natural scales that provide a handy, always-on defense. \"There is no monster he won't slay,\" Valve said. \"No creature he won't woo. No tyrant he won't stand against. And no noble immune to his silver tongue.\"\n\nThe Dark Willow Mireska Sunbreeze, the daughter of a fae merchant, also appears to be a mischievous sort, but of a much darker bent: \"While she was quite adept at navigating the etiquette, unspoken laws, and social rituals that permeated every element of her life, she found the whole thing rather boring. So, Mireska did what most rebellious children do: burn down her family estate and set off with her pet wisp Jex to live the life of a wandering grifter.\"\n\nTo ensure that the matchmaking rating [MMR] system is \"recent and accurate\" for everyone, MMR for both ranked and unranked players will now work on a six-month seasonal system, the first of which will begin in two weeks. Players will be given a profile medal for each season based on their peak skill during that season, which will be displayed, along with their previous seasonal medal, to all players before each match.\n\n\"At the start of each season all players will recalibrate MMR, seeded by their previous season's MMR,\" Valve explained. \"Your current historical preseason MMR value will be recorded and selectable in your profile, and ranked players will continue to be able to track their current seasonal MMR value.\"\n\nOther changes of note: Turbo Mode keeps the same game rules as All Pick but grants more gold and experience to heroes, weakens defensive towers, and reduces respawn time, all of which will simplify the process of trying out new heroes and strategies; the Ability Draft has been given a new interface; the Guide system is more easily accessible; and new functionality has been added to the Ping Wheel. We'll have a more in-depth analysis of everything that's going on here for you soon, and in the meantime you can dive into the patch notes yourself at dota2.com.\n\nUpdate: The post originally indicated that the Dueling Fates update was live today, but it will not actually be out until November 1.",

Bella does like to cuddle, and can often times be found snoring on her favorite person's lap.\n\nGallery of Dogs Available for Adoption\n\nSaying Goodbye to Breed Baggage\n\nEach animal in the care of The Anti-Cruelty Society is special and, as animal welfare experts, we are committed to caring for all of them. But sometimes, everyone gets caught up in what the breed is rather than what the animal is like. The reality is that in a shelter environment, we do not always know the parentage of dogs and honestly, we believe that their behavior and the connection someone has or can establish with the dog is way more important.\n\nSO, effective immediately, The Anti-Cruelty Society will not list the breed but rather focus on the behavior, as we feel this is the best indicator of success in meeting an adopter's needs. Of course, what a dog looks like matters—large or small, smooth coats or rough, droop ears or erect. But it is their level of activity, training needs, and other behaviors that will likely define a successful match. If you still want to know the breed, we encourage you to consult your veterinarian or, for the most definitive answer, get a DNA test.\n\nEach one of our dogs is an individual, and we no longer want to burden any of them with breed baggage that may not be accurate. The only thing we can be absolutely sure of is that they are all one of a kind.\n\nThis page offers up to the second information about our animals available for adoption at our Adoption Center at 510 N.

      "Standing on Mount Aragats, the high priest waited until the sun set his torch on fire so that it could be carried to the pagan temple of Garni. Thus began Navasard, one of Armenia's oldest and most popular holidays, celebrated every year on August 11.\n\nAccording to legend, on this day the patriarch Hayk slew the tyrant Bel and freed his family and future generations of Armenians.\n\nThe combination of athletics and ancient rituals makes Navasard reminiscent of the Olympic Games.\n\nAfter the high priest clad in a red tunic faces the sun and sings a hymn to Vahagn, the festivities begin with young people singing and dancing, and playing at archery. Anyone wishing to join the pagan community is initiated in a \"fire and sword\" ritual, and then plants an apricot tree.\n\nAlthough all this looks like time-honoured ceremony - this year is counted as the 9,588th since the birth of Vahagn, the supreme deity in the Armenian pagan pantheon - the festival is in fact a modern revival.\n\n\"We resumed celebrating ancient Armenian holidays in 1990,\" Slak Kakosian, the high priest of Armenia, told IWPR. \"Before that, everything was banned. They sent me to the prison camps for two years for 'nationalism' in 1961, and forced me to emigrate to the United States in 1965. I only came back during the Gorbachev era.\"\n\nPolitically, the pagan community is affiliated with the Armenian Republican Party, whose philosophy is based on the teachings of Tsegakron, the Armenian pre-Christian religion.\n\nBut the latter-day pagans distance themselves from politics. Historian Ara Stepanian, who comes here from St Petersburg in Russia every year, said, \"There's too much politics in people's lives already, and that's not good. The more people think about spiritual revival, the better their chances of survival.\"\n\nHe recommends that the Ukhtagir, or pagan scripture, should replace the Bible as every thinking Armenian's handbook.\n\n\"A thousand copies of the book are soon due out in print, and community members will hand them out to the people. It is not our intention to fully replace the Bible with the Ukhtagir, but Armenian people should know they did not descend from Noah, but that they lived here in the mountains of Armenia before the Flood,\" said Kakosian.\n\nArmenia is commonly regarded as the world's first Christian state, following the conversion of King Tiridates in the year 301, and its religious identity has marked it out among its largely Muslim neighbours.\n\nBut pre-Christian sun-worship still lingers in the national consciousness. As well as the temple at Garni, Armenia also has its own prehistoric Stonehenge, known as Karaundj, or Singing Stones, in the south of the country. A sprawling structure with hundreds of standing monoliths, it was built 6,000 years ago as a temple of the sun, doubling as an astronomical observatory.\n\nIn a poll recently held by the Centre for Strategic and National Studies in Yerevan, 34 per cent of Armenians said they consider themselves Christian, 24 per cent said they were atheists, and 32 per cent declared themselves to be pagans. \"The slight differences in percentages of believers proves that 1,700 years of Christianity have failed to eradicate the old faith in Armenia,\" said political commentator Eduard Enfiajian, also a member of the pagan community.\n\n\"In Armenia, many people identify religion with the church establishment. Not us. We have nothing against Christianity, but as a social institution, it is not acceptable to us. Religion is constitutionally separated from the state, but in reality, they teach Christianity even in kindergartens, not to mention schools, universities and the armed forces. To me, this is wrong; a person should be able to choose which God he will obey.\"\n\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church takes an unusually relaxed view of its pagan competitors, considering its hostility to more recent evangelical groups.\n\n\"Unlike the new sects, they have nothing to do with Christianity,\" explained the Reverend Vagram Melikian, press spokesman for the Armenian church in Echmiadzin. \"The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians, but we do not interfere in pagan affairs.\"\n\nSome Armenians manage to combine sympathy for both the traditional Christian church and paganism.\n\n\"The pagans are custodians of the old customs,\" explained Alexander Amarian, head of the Help Centre for the Victims of Destructive Cults, which campaigns against other religious groups or \"sects\" as they are commonly called here. \"The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children [a pagan group] help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects. A protest against sects was held recently",
      "HTC is a prime example of how fast the smartphone market can change. It has existed for just 16 years, and in that time it grew from making devices for other brands, to become the third most valuable smartphone manufacturer in the world in 2011. Just two years later, the super-hot HTC brand has cooled, and the cash reserves are dwindling. How did Android's first OEM climb so high, so fast, and why did it fall from grace?\n\nSmall beginnings\n\nOriginally founded as the High-Tech Computer Corporation in 1997, by Cher Wang and H. T. Cho, the company didn't officially change its name to HTC until 2008. Wang's father made billions after founding a plastics and petrochemicals conglomerate and his daughter would follow in his entrepreneurial footsteps. With her friend, Peter Chou ensconced as CEO, the Taiwanese company started out on a disastrous laptop project, but soon changed direction to manufacture PDAs and mobile phones, initially for other companies. Starting with Compaq, then HP and Palm, HTC quickly built a reputation for innovative technology and high quality.\n\nViagallery\n\nWork on pocket PCs, like the Compaq iPAQ, led to smartphones running the Windows Mobile platform. HTC manufactured WinMo phones for Fujitsu-Siemens and Sony Ericsson. The company impressed as a contract manufacturer and caught the attention of various major carriers including T-Mobile, Orange, and O2. Co-branding was a first step towards striking out on its own and by the time the first HTC-branded devices hit the market in 2006, the company had a wealth of valuable experience and contacts.\n\nEmerging from the shadows\n\nThe transition from manufacturing devices for other brands to building a name for HTC wasn't easy, but a determined focus on the cutting edge and a willingness to adopt new ideas would serve the company well. 2008 was a pivotal year as the T-Mobile G1 (HTC Dream) launched the Android operating system. It boasted a 3.2-inch display with a resolution of 320 x 480 pixels, a 528 MHz processor, 192MB of RAM, and a 3.15-megapixel camera. The display slid to the side to reveal a physical keyboard. The reviews were mostly positive and the G1 sold more than 1 million units in the U.S. in the first six months after release.\n\nIt was followed by the HTC Magic (T-Mobile myTouch 3G) and then, in July 2009, the Hero, which was the first release to feature the HTC Sense user interface. After that came the Tattoo and the Droid Eris, but in 2010 things really took off. The first Google branded phone, the Nexus One, was manufactured by HTC and it was soon joined by the similar HTC Desire. Both devices ran Android 2.1, had 1GHz processors, 3.7-inch, 800 x 480 pixel displays, and 5-megapixel cameras.\n\nThe Nexus One showed HTC's importance to Google and cemented its place in the vanguard of the fast-growing Android platform. The Desire was a more polished device and proved to be a major critical success. The company did not rest on its laurels, following up with the Droid Incredible, the HTC Legend, and the budget HTC Wildfire.\n\nThe high point\n\nIt never got better than the third quarter of 2011 for HTC when it announced after-tax profits of $625 million. The company managed to claim third place behind Samsung and Apple, leapfrogging Nokia in terms of value based on soaring sales. According to Bloomberg it was the largest smartphone vendor in the U.S. with a 24 percent market share. The \"quietly brilliant\" brand had grown into a deafening roar. Awards, plaudits, and a mountain of cash took HTC into unfamiliar territory. It was a stunning success, but Samsung's growth soon threatened to undermine it.\n\nHTC has lost ground steadily ever since. The company announced its first loss since 2002 earlier this month, a net loss of $101 million. The Q3 2011 revenue of $4.54 billion has fallen to $1.6 billion last quarter. There's no doubt that fierce competition from Samsung has taken its toll, but there are other reasons that HTC has fallen.\n\nMoney down the drain\n\nWith cash flowing into the coffers, HTC embarked on a licensing and patent acquisition spree to try and protect itself from lawsuits, particularly patent infringement claims from Microsoft and Apple. It spent $75 million on a collection of ADC Telecom patents. Then there was the $300 million acquisition of S3 Graphics. Despite these defensive acquisitions, and support from Google, which tried to lend HTC patents to use in its case against Apple, the company didn't fare well in the courtroom. It ended up signing licensing agreements with Microsoft and Apple in order to settle cases. That means HTC is paying a royalty on every Android handset it sells.\n\nThe company also made some questionable investments. It spent $40 million",

      "Drew Cannon photo via Raleigh News Observer Drew Cannon stood courtside in Cameron Indoor Stadium before a 2012 Duke-Carolina game.\n\nORLANDO — There was a time when Drew Cannon might have tended bar in Chicago's North Side at a place near Wrigley Field named Merkle's Bar & Grill. That time was about one year ago.\n\nIt was partially owned by a family member, and it was looking like a steady gig last summer when Cannon moved to Chicago, partly to get away from North Carolina, where he grew up and went to college at Duke University.\n\nBut then Brad Stevens, an admirer of the in-depth basketball analytics articles that Cannon had been writing, reached out and offered the 22-year-old a job at Butler University, ultimately making Cannon the first pure statistics-based hire on a college basketball staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA year later, Cannon, now 23, will follow Stevens from Butler to the Celtics, though it's unclear exactly what his role will be. \"I'm anxious to add him to our staff to see what he's all about,\" Danny Ainge, the Celtics president of basketball operations, said Monday at the Orlando Summer League.\n\nGet Sports Headlines in your inbox: The most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nStevens knows full well what Cannon is all about — and the coach is a huge fan.\n\n\"He's really talented because he's really ambitious,\" Stevens, who was hired last week as the 17th head coach in Celtics history, told the Globe.\n\n\"He's really bright, and he's really naive — and when I say that, it's that he doesn't have any preconceived thoughts on what the world should look like. He's just trying to figure out what he thinks fits.\"\n\nAt Butler, Cannon fit right into a program that, under Stevens, leaned on advanced statistical metrics, using data to help find any and every edge. His in-depth research — on lineups, substitution patterns, and more — made him an invaluable resource (a \"secret weapon,\" stated the headline of a Sports Illustrated article in March that first shed light about Cannon).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What Drew has a great ability to do is not only to analyze but communicate it,\" Stevens said. \"He can break things down into the simplest terms. He's got a sense for the basketball side of things and he's a good communicator to me with it.\"\n\nIn terms of Cannon's role with the Celtics, Stevens added, \"Again, I like the idea that it's not really defined. I don't want that. I don't want it to be restraining at all.\"\n\nOf course, that Cannon will become a member of the Celtics and a front office that believes strongly in analytics marks a new beginning for him and concludes an interesting journey from where he was at around this time last summer.\n\n\"It's been basically one year since he was really kind of up in the air about what he was going to do — to this,\" said Jim, his father. \"That's just unimaginable.\"\n\nA true passion\n\nIt was around Christmas, the break between Cannon's first and second semesters of his senior year at Duke, that he approached his parents to have a serious sit-down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCannon asked, according to Jim, \"When do I have to start looking for a real job?\"\n\nOn one hand, his father thought that Cannon ought to have one pretty soon after graduating from a good (and expensive) private school in Durham.\n\nOn the other, Jim realized that Cannon had spent the past several years interning with recruiting analyst Dave Telep, writing about basketball analytics and doing it quite well, too.\n\nAnd Jim believed that his son had earned the right to see that passion all the way through.\n\n\"If it didn't work out, fine,\" Jim said. \"He could go do another job. He still had a very useful degree from a very good school.\n\n\"And we were fortunate that if he had to live in the basement for a year, we could feed him. He would've had to share the basement with the dog, but so be it.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Cannon had moved back in with his family in Raleigh for a short time. But he made it clear that he also wanted to move out, just to get away from the nest, and from North Carolina.\n\nSo, he moved to Chicago and lived with family.\n\n\"If nothing had worked out,\" Jim said, \"he was going to get a bartending job and work for College Basketball Prospectus and Kenpom.com and maybe ESPN Insider on the side until something materialized.\"\n\nOf course, something materialized — the job at Butler under Stevens, who called Telep one day last summer",
      "Hi,We do not support tabs through the API at the moment but we will likely make it happen in the future.However what you can do now is group features in the same page as sub-section using the AddGroup() method. If you have a tons of settings though, it will cause a rather long scrolling panel.Eventually, if you are feeling adventurous (as we do not officially support direct access to the underlying code) and reaalllyy can't wait, since mods overriding the UI are already referencing the game assembly and the ColossalFramework assembly, make sure to include the relevant namespaces in your using clause and cast the UIHelperBase parameter to UIHelper.Once casted, the getter helper.self will return an object directly referencing the root UIComponent of the panel (in the case of the upper most root, it will be an UIScrollablePanel so cast is needed again) and you can mess around with the content of the panel without API restrictions.Of course, it is quite a lot of work to create all of these manually but in many cases you have already been doing that kind of work around to expose your properties before the patch...Note: If you duplicate an object which already exists in the scene (as I think T++ did with the OptionsPanel by duplicating it, cleaning all children and spawning its own UI, make very very sure to also clean up our potential scripts attached to that same object as it results in this example to multiple OptionsPanel instance waiting for events at the same time and when an event triggers, the duplicated-cleaned up version will fire null reference exceptions).Hope that helps a bit,Cheers",

Sign Up , it unlocks many cool features!\n\nrawdownloadcloneembedreportprint text 15.28 KB Resources you will need======================= 1. editor for .DDS files a. Photoshop Get it from wherever the fuck you want, I use CS3. In order to edit/save .DDS files in Photoshop you will need the nVidia texture tools plugin here: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop b. Gimp This has a plugin for .dds files, but I fucking hate Gimp and have Photoshop anyways, try this if you want to fiddle and get it to work. I've had positive reports of this working, but again, it's not something I use. c. Paint.net Get it from http://www.getpaint.net/ - this supports .dds right from the get go and is free, but its configuration for saving is pretty bunk, I haven't messed around with it enough to ever get it to work on its own yet. You can use this in conjunction with DDSOpt to do fine work though. Optional/Helpful DDSOpt This is a utility that was made for Skyrim a few years back and is still the best option for converting files to .dds, while you can make do with just Photoshop, or just Gimp, this will probably produce higher quality .dds files with better compression and also just be more reliable in general, get it here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5755/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D5755&pUp=1 See later for a more detailed description on how to use this. 2. .arc file Unpacker/Repacker ARCtool.exe This is going to be the actual workhorse behind unpacking the game's resource files, and repacking them to be able to utilize. Grab it from FluffyQuack's post here: http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/481/arc-unpacker-repacker-v0-26 And a batch file to actually interface with ARCtool.exe Now that the game is out, FluffyQuack has released an update to the ARCTool along with a batch file for DD on PC, grab the PC batch files in the post and pull pc-dd out. If you're editing textures you want to add the -tex flag, my batch file looks as following: arctool -dd -texRE6 -alwayscomp -pc -txt -v 7 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 -tex There are some additional flags you can use, but I've had crashes with a few when I wasn't messing with their types (this may have been fixed in one of the subsequent version releases), so use them sparingly or if you're specifically looking to edit those files: -xfs : XFS <-> XML -lot : LOT <-> TXT -gmd : GMD <-> TXT I have another batch file I use when I'm looking through large amount of files for something I want, to process a lot of arcs in a row without having to click and drag each one: FOR /R %%f IN (*.arc) DO arctool -dd -texRE6 -alwayscomp -pc -v 7 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 -tex -xfs -lot -gmd \"%%f\" This will unpack all .arc files in the same folder as the .bat file. This does not work the other way around, and I suggest that once you find the .arc with the things you're looking for you unpack and repack with the .bat file above. 3. A system for backups a. You could use some sort of software to track and notate your changes, like TortoiseSVN or something. This would also allow you to more easily make an online repository to work with others on larger scale projects if you felt so inclined. b. I just use a couple folders. I have a Backup folder where I keep the originals of .arc files I'm editing, as well as a direct unpack of the .arc file, so I can grab individual textures to put back in if I mess up the format somewhere. c. Another possibility is just utilizing a copy right where the original lived. Before editing an .arc file, just copy and paste it right there, then you'll have a big red flag right where you made a change as [original file",

      "Hi! It's Shannon from Rosyscription again! I'm back for Christmas to share a simple and sparkly recycled DIY ornaments with you today!\n\nRaise your hand if you have your hubby or significant other trained to ask you before throwing stuff out? My husband knows better than to toss old jars and bottles in the recycle bin. He usually gives me a chance to look them over for crafty potential. He also knows that I've been collecting metallic jar lids lately specifically for DIY Christmas ornaments.\n\nWhat he didn't know is how amazing these recycled rhinestone DIY ornaments would look when they were done! Aren't they pretty? I think they kind of look like the inside of a geode rock. You know, those big rocks that are filled with encrusted gems when cracked open? Maybe?\n\nRegardless of what they look like, these ornaments are sooo easy to make. Let me show you how to make a rhinestone geode ornament from a lid:\n\nRhinestone DIY Ornaments\n\nSupplies\n\nRecycled lids (preferably plain and metallic in color)\n\nMod Podge Gloss\n\nMod Podge Dimensional Magic\n\nBrush\n\nRhinestones (I find mine at the dollar store)\n\nPower drill\n\nRibbon\n\nStep One: Drill a very small hole into the edges of each canning lid with your power drill. (not pictured)\n\nStep Two: Brush a thick layer of Mod Podge onto the inside area of the lid. Start placing your rhinestones down into the glue. Continue to fill in with more stones and use more glue as you fill in the gaps. It is OK to overlap the pieces with each other. Some of the stones may flip upside down . . . but don't worry if they do! The mirrored bottoms of the gems will add more shine and texture to your ornament. Once the inside of the lid is completely covered with gems, allow the glue to dry.\n\nStep Three: Take your bottle of Dimensional Magic and carefully pour the material in and around the gemstones until the jewels are almost covered in the glue. Allow the DM to dry overnight. When the thick glue is dry, it will be crystal clear! It will look like your gems are embedded in resin.\n\nStep Four: Thread a length of thin ribbon through the pre-drill holes and tie the ends to create a ribbon loop. Hang your pretty, recycled holiday ornament on your tree this year!\n\nI love how these ornaments bounce the light around. They are going to be the perfect addition to our Christmas tree this year. In my opinion, the holidays should be filled with lots of sparkle and shine!\n\nIf you like these recycled DIY ornaments, check out some other options from friends of mine:",

      "The U.S. flag flies in front of the Capitol Dome in Washington. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nColumnist\n\nAfter repeatedly failing in their cynical efforts that would cut millions from health insurance rolls, congressional Republicans now are attacking the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).\n\nTogether with President Trump's earlier budget plan, which would slice and dice federal retirement, Capitol Hill and the White House have mounted a multi-front assault on federal worker compensation.\n\nIf a House Budget Resolution proposal becomes law, federal retiree health insurance premiums could rise significantly over time because growth in the government's subsidy would be limited to the increase in inflation.\n\n\"Federal retirees earned their retiree health benefits through years of hard work for this country. Shifting more of the cost of the premiums onto their backs now — when they have already entered retirement — fails to honor the commitments and promises made to them in exchange for their service,\" said Richard Thissen, president of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association.\n\nLinking the government's subsidy to inflation sounds reasonable, until you realize that health-care costs rise much faster than the general inflation rate.\n\n\"As a rough estimate, it would raise annuitant premiums by about 2 percent a year more than they would otherwise rise,\" said Walton Francis, a health-care economist and lead author of Checkbook's annual Guide to Health Plans for Federal Employees. \"After 10 years, that would be about a 20 percent increase in costs to annuitants.\"\n\nJacqueline Simon, policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, predicted FEHBP would be \"vastly more expensive for retirees\" under the House plan.\n\nCurrently, the government pays about 70 percent of federal health insurance premiums, while enrollees pay 30 percent. Under the House plan, that could flip, Simon said, with employees and retirees paying 80 percent of their health insurance costs after 20 years.\n\n\"This proposal imposes substantial financial harm,\" she added.\n\nThe retirees know it.\n\nLinda Kurz, 77, who retired from the Veterans Health Service after 37 years, said the House plan \"will probably at least double or triple my premium for standard individual coverage. … All of us need insurance because one never knows what lies ahead. I hope and pray that I don't need more than occasional doctor visits and the least necessary medication for a long time.\n\n\"It will likely make federal recruitment more difficult. It is a shame that federal employees are repeatedly asked to fund reduction of the deficit or to fund the 'wall' or tax cuts including for those who earn more than enough.\"\n\nJoanne Pedersen, who worked for the Navy Department for more than 30 years, said she \"was promised health care for life. It would create a great hardship should my premiums increase.\"\n\nFederal employees also were promised a good retirement program. But Trump's proposal would undercut it by increasing out-of-pocket employee payments and decreasing retirement benefits.\n\nThe House plan would further deteriorate federal employee compensation by, in the words of the proposal, \"basing Federal employee retirees' health benefits on length of service. This option would reduce premium subsidies for retirees who had relatively short Federal careers.\"\n\nWith the inflation and length of service provisions, \"these two reforms would bring health benefits for Federal retirees more in line with those offered in the private sector.\"\n\nHouse Republicans think that's a good thing.\n\nYes, federal benefits are better than many in the private sector. That comes with Uncle Sam's desire to be a model employer. Instead of seeking better benefits for all, under the House plan Sam wouldn't be much better than the bottom feeders.\n\n\"Over the past few decades, the share of large employers offering retiree health benefits has dropped fairly dramatically,\" said Tricia Neuman, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that analyzes health-care policy. \"With fewer and fewer large employers offering retiree health benefits, we're now seeing a clear decline in the share of seniors with retiree health benefits.\"\n\nIf they can't afford to buy insurance to supplement Medicare, one possible result of a decline in retiree health benefits is a decline in health care for seniors who need it the most.\n\nIs that what Sam wants for his annuitants?\n\nRead more:\n\nFederal employees pay more for insurance, but it's still a good deal\n\nDemocratic senators hit Trump's retirement cuts for feds\n\nHits on federal retirement advance as bill is introduced to fire feds for 'no cause at all'",

      "REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the Federal Assembly, including State Duma deputies, members of the Federation Council, regional governors and civil society representatives, at the Kremlin in Moscow March 18, 2014. Putin said on Tuesday Crimea would have three equal languages; Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin claimed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea to be a part of Russia on Tuesday and signed a treaty to make it so.\n\nIn a defiant speech, arguably \"the most significant of his 14-year rule,\" Putin refused to recognise the interim government in Kiev and drew deeply from Russian and Soviet history to bash the West.\n\n\"In the case of Ukraine, our Western partners have crossed a line, a red line,\" Putin said. \"They have been unprofessional, they have [been] irresponsible.\"\n\nPutin's words exacerbated what is already the most tense international situation since the fall of the Soviet Union. Some consider the address to be the harbinger of a new Cold War, just as hostilities are intensifying on Ukraine's eastern border.\n\nGeopolitical expert Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group, who predicted the Russian occupation and annexation of Crimea, shared his thoughts on the momentous speech:\n\n\"Putin doesn't accept the abrogation of the European-brokered Yanukovych/opposition deal and accordingly views the Ukrainian government as illegitimate. This shouldn't surprise the West (particularly given the importance of Ukraine to the Russian president), but the U.S. has refused to address [this issue]. \"Now the Russians have responded with a sham referendum on Crimean independence, which Putin has promptly recognised. Warnings and redlines from the West — or at least, those that were remotely credible — were never going to have an impact on the Russians here; the importance of the interests are too asymmetrical.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Putin reiterated his view that \"nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites\" executed the \"coup\" that ousted Kremlin ally Viktor Yanukovych and turned Ukraine toward the EU.\n\nThat Russia's ruler holds that position after the annexation of Crimea signals that the crisis is far from over.\n\nFrom Bremmer:\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's very difficult to create a new status quo at Crimea. Putin's speech today made very clear that the Russians aren't prepared to accept the present Ukrainian government going forward, Crimea or no Crimea. \"Which implies — at the very least — strong political and economic pressure, while the West and Russia exchange tit-for-tat sanctions. But there's also a very real possibility that Putin doesn't see a peaceful way to bring Ukraine back into the Russian fold, and so finds pretenses of mistreatment of ethnic Russians to justify a direct military intervention.\"\n\nThe sanctions war is heating up, and the standoff between Ukrainian soldiers in their bases and Russian soldiers without insignia outside is boiling over: On Tuesday, a Ukrainian soldier died and at least one other was injured during a raid on a base in the peninsula's main town Simferopol.\n\nConsequently, interim Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said that the conflict was moving \"from a political one to a military one because of Russian soldiers.\"\n\nThroughout the crisis, Putin has reserved the right to use force to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine from \"lawlessness.\"\n\nThe major concern in Ukraine is that pro-Russian special forces and other provocateurs will foment unrest in Ukraine's east and south, which have sizable ethnic Russian populations, and Russia will subsequently invade under the pretext of protecting them.\n\nBremmer explained what the West can do in the given the severity of the circumstances:\n\n\"At that point, Iran-type sanctions come into play from the U.S. Whether or not the Europeans would follow (the Chinese won't) is an open question. But this is becoming an extremely costly, and geopolitically dangerous, conflict. And as with the sparring over Syria, the biggest losers are ultimately the Ukrainians.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: Briefing videos\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

      "Pluto has always been something of an outcast. It orbits the sun at a weird angle, not even close to those of the planets.\n\nIt's also way, way out there — some six billion kilometres from the sun. And for a variety of reasons it was kicked out of our planetary family in 2006, demoted by astronomers to a mere \"dwarf planet.\"\n\nUntil recently, Pluto was thought to be little more than a frozen rock; a dull footnote at the end of the solar system.\n\nWell, Pluto is still remote and still not a planet. But the \"dull\" part was crossed out this week thanks to the latest pictures from the New Horizons probe that left NASA scientists giddily throwing around words like \"amazing\" and \"mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe pictures appear to upend some of our previous ideas about the presumed dead, dwarf planet. Most notably, it might not be dead.\n\nWhere are the craters?\n\nA close-up of Pluto's equatorial region revealed a big surprise: an icy mountain range with peaks as high as 3,500 metres, comparable in size to some of the smaller Rocky Mountains.\n\nNASA scientists believe the mountains may still be forming, which suggests the region might still be geologically active, throwing up some combination of water and gases from a heated core.\n\nMembers of the New Horizons team react to the last and sharpest image of Pluto at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, on Thursday. The dwarf planet's newly discovered 'heart' region is clearly visible. (Bill Ingalls/NASA/Reuters)\n\n\"Who would've supposed there were ice mountains? It's just blowing my mind,\" project scientist Hal Weaver said at a news conference.\n\nElsewhere in the solar system, surface features are formed on icy moons by heat caused by gravitational interactions with heavyweight planets like Jupiter and Saturn. But there's nothing that big anywhere near Pluto.\n\nNASA says \"some other process\" must be making those mountains.\n\n\"This may cause us to rethink what powers geological activity on many other icy worlds,\" said John Spencer of the Southwest Research Institute.\n\nAnother surprise is that Pluto and at least one of its moons lack the many craters one would expect to find on an object that's been around for some 4.5 billion years, taking hits from meteorites and the like.\n\nEarth's moon is about the same age, and looks it.\n\nBut Pluto has \"one of the youngest surfaces we've ever seen in the solar system,\" according to Jeff Moore, leader of the geology and geophysics team at NASA's Ames Research Centre.\n\nNASA is suggesting that recent geologic activity may have given the region \"a facelift, erasing those pockmarks.\" Scientists will now go looking for geysers and so-called \"ice volcanos.\"\n\nPluto's largest moon, Charon, also showed a surprising lack of craters, suggesting it too might be geologically active.\n\nSmall, but not that small\n\nNew Horizons also settled the long-running question about Pluto's exact size, which, since its discovery almost a century ago, has been hard to measure because of its atmosphere.\n\nPrevious Next\n\nPrevious estimates put its diameter somewhere above 2,300 kilometres, but mission scientists this week said it is a slightly larger 2,370.\n\n\"We are excited to finally lay this question to rest,\" said mission scientist Bill McKinnon in a statement.\n\nCharon has no significant atmosphere and New Horizons confirmed it is 1,208 kilometres in diameter.\n\nNew Horizons also snuck a peek at two of Pluto's smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, which are estimated to be about 35 and 45 kilometres across, respectively.\n\nHeart-shaped blob\n\nPluto's heart-shaped region has been named for astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930. (NASA/Associated Press)\n\nPerhaps because it's an outcast, or because it shares a name with a cartoon dog, people get sentimental about Pluto. And it turns out the not-quite planet also has a very big sentimental side. That is found about 1,600 kilometres across and just above Pluto's equator.\n\nThe bright, heart-shaped region was first spotted on July 7 and came into sharper focus on July 13 — getting a \"wow\" from New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern.\n\n\"This is proof that good things really do come in small packages,\" Stern said.\n\nThe region has been named the Tombaugh Regio in honour of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930, a gesture that brought a heart-felt round of applause at the NASA news conference.",
      "Researchers at the University of Paris and colleagues fed the molecule fullerene (C60 or \"buckyballs\") dissolved in olive oil to rats and found it almost doubles their lifespan, with no chronic toxicity.\n\nThe results suggest that the effect of C60, an antioxidant, on lifespan is mainly due to the attenuation of age-associated increases in oxidative stress, according to the researchers.\n\nPharmacokinetic studies show that dissolved C60 is absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract and eliminated in a few tens of hours.\n\n\"These results of importance in the fields of medicine and toxicology should open the way for the many possible biomedical applications of C60 including cancer therapy, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging,\" the researcher suggest.\n\n\"C60 can be administered orally, and as it is now produced in tons, it is no longer necessary to resort to its water-soluble derivatives, which are difficult to purify and, in contrast to pristine C60, may be toxic.\n\nSince 1993, countless studies showed that fullerene (C60) and derivatives exhibit paramount potentialities in several fields of biology and medicine, mainly including specific DNA cleavage, imaging, UV and radioprotection, antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-amyloid activities, allergic response and angiogenesis inhibitions, immune stimulating and antitumor effects, enhancing effect on neurite outgrowth, gene delivery, and even hair-growing activity, a summary in the Biomaterials paper stated.\n\nRef.: Baati T, et al., The prolongation of the lifespan of rats by repeated oral administration of [60]fullerene, Biomaterials (2012), doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.03.036",
      "NBC will be presenting its fall 2017 schedule without having made a decision on two of its bubble series, freshmen Trial & Error and Chicago Justice. Neither has been particularly strong ratings-wise, but both have something going for them.\n\nTrial & Error has been well received by critics, and with its anthology concept could attract big-name actors for a season-long arc, like John Lithgow in Season 1. NBC brass had been excited about a storyline planned for next season.

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin and his supporters in Russia and the West have accused the Ukrainian opposition that led the fight against the criminal Yanukovych regime and the democratic Ukrainian government that succeeded that regime of being fascist, neo-Nazi, and anti-Semitic.\n\nThe following quotations—by Putin and his most unremitting academic supporter in New York City on the one hand, and by three of Ukraine's leading Jewish officials on the other—should settle the issue. Putin is beyond redemption, of course, but Professor Cohen may want to take account of the evidence and, like a good revisionist historian, revise his views.\n\nVladimir Putin, president of the Russian Federation, March 4, 2014:\n\nArmed and masked militants are still roaming the streets of Kiev…. We see the rampage of reactionary forces, nationalist and anti-Semitic forces going on in certain parts of Ukraine, including Kiev…. [W]e understand what worries the citizens of Ukraine, both Russian and Ukrainian, and the Russian-speaking population in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. It is this uncontrolled crime that worries them.\n\nYaakov Dov Bleich, chief rabbi of Ukraine, March 3, 2014:\n\nRabbi Yaakov Dov Bleich, a chief rabbi of Ukraine, accused Russia of staging anti-Semitic \"provocations\" in Crimea in order to justify its invasion of the former Soviet republic. At a press conference in the Manhattan office of the United Jewish Communities of Eastern Europe, Bleich compared Russia's behavior to that of the Nazis prior to the Anschluss invasion of Austria in 1938. \"Things may be done by Russians dressing up as Ukrainian nationalists,\" he said, adding that it's \"the same way the Nazis did when they wanted to go into Austria and created provocations.\" Bleich, a vice president of the World Jewish Congress, also announced the creation of an aid effort, KievRelief.org, to fund security for synagogues and mosques and to provide humanitarian relief for all Ukrainians. Bleich, who moved to Ukraine in 1989 from Brooklyn, was slated, along with other Ukrainian political and religious leaders, to meet with Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday. He said he will urge Kerry to be assertive with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to move the G8 Summit to Kiev, as a show of solidarity with Ukrainians, and to consider sending military support to Ukraine. While acknowledging that Americans are \"war-weary,\" he said Ukrainians need \"boots on the ground to protect democracy\" and to prevent \"the cold war from getting hot.\" Asked about anti-Semitism among Ukrainian nationalists, particularly two far-right parties that have been included in the new government, Bleich acknowledged concerns but said the Jewish community has received assurances from top government leaders that their safety will be protected. \"The Russians are blowing this way, way out of proportion,\" he said, referring to the issue of anti-Semitism among some Ukrainian nationalist factions. He said that Ukrainians were united in response to the Russian intervention. \"There were many differences of opinion throughout the revolution, but today all that is gone,\" he said. \"We're faced by an outside threat called Russia. It's brought everyone together.\"\n\nRabbi Misha Kapustin, rabbi of the Simferopol Reform Synagogue Ner Tamid, Crimea, March 3, 2014:\n\nMany here are against the Russians but are afraid to talk. I am a Ukrainian citizen and want to live in democratic Ukraine. The government has always provided protection for the Jews, and all the talk of anti-Semitism is exaggerated. The Russians have invaded illegally and that must be opposed. So far, people have encouraged me and I don't believe my petition will cause any harm to the Jews.\n\nStephen F. Cohen, professor of Russian studies and history at New York University, January 30, 2014:\n\n… the street in Kiev is now controlled by these right-wing extremists. And that extremism has spread to western Ukraine, where these people are occupying government buildings. So, in fact, you have a political civil war under way. What is the face of these people, this right wing? A, they hate Europe as much as they hate Russia. Their official statement is: Europe is homosexuals, Jews, and the decay of the Ukrainian state. They want nothing to do with Europe. They want nothing to do with Russia. I'm talking about this—it's not a fringe, but this very right-wing thing. What does their political activity include? It includes writing on buildings in western Ukraine, \"Jews live here.\" That's exactly what the Nazis wrote on the homes of Jews when they occupied Ukraine. A priest who represents part of the political movement in western Ukraine—Putin quoted this, but it doesn't make it false. It doesn't make it false; it's been verified. A western Ukrainian priest said, \"We, Ukraine, will not be governed by Negroes, Jews or Russians.\" So, these people have now come to the fore.\n\nJose",
      "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A tentative deal was reached between screenwriters and producers Tuesday, averting a strike that could have crippled TV and film production.\n\nThe three-year agreement, which requires ratification by members of the Writers Guild of America, was confirmed by the guild and producers' spokesman Jarryd Gonzales shortly after the current contract expired early Tuesday. The deal came after a flurry of last-minute bargaining, conducted during a media blackout that offered no tangible details about whether picket lines would go up until after midnight Tuesday.\n\nIn a memo to its members, the guild said gains were made across the board, including contributions to the union's health plan that should \"ensure its solvency for years to come\" — an issue that writers considered key.\n\nThe union said it also made strides in pay for series with fewer episodes per season, and in residuals. Members overall will net $130 million more over the contract's life than they were expected to accept, according to the memo.\n\nThere were no details released by the producers early Tuesday.\n\nThe agreement spares the late-night shows that would immediately have gone dark without writers, and allows the networks to pursue their schedules for the upcoming TV season without interruption. Movie production would have felt a strike's sting more gradually.\n\nGuild members voted overwhelmingly last month to authorize a strike, and the WGA could have called for an immediate walkout Tuesday absent a deal. The previous writers' strike extracted an estimated $2 billion toll on the state of California. The producers group said the 2007-08 strike cost writers $287 million in lost compensation.\n\nRuss DeVol, the chief research officer at the Milken Institute, estimated a strike of similar duration would have cost California $2.5 billion today.\n\nAfter the 2007-08 strike, the two sides reached agreements in 2010 and 2013, but TV writers in particular have seen their earnings slide since then and wanted to claw back some of those losses.\n\nDriving the dispute were changes in how television is distributed, with streaming platforms including Netflix and Amazon joining broadcast and cable TV and rising in importance.\n\nMore outlets have led to more shows, but the TV season model is greatly changed. Despite the fact that there are more series than ever — 455 this season, more than double the number six years ago — shows run for fewer episodes than the traditional 22-24 episode broadcast series.\n\nShort seasons of eight, 10 or 12 episodes means less pay for writers whose payment is structured on a per-episode basis.\n\nTo address that, the guild said it won additional compensation for writers who spend more than 2.4 weeks working on a script.\n\nThe guild also touted first-time job protection for writers on parental leave.\n\nThe agreement avoided a repeat of the 2007-08 strike, which played out in true Hollywood style. Writers took to social media to make their case, entertainingly. Stars including Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Tina Fey joined picket lines, and then-\"Tonight Show\" host Jay Leno brought doughnuts for strikers.\n\nBefore Tuesday's deal was announced, writer-actress Lena Dunham said she would back a strike this time.\n\n\"I would never have had the health coverage I had without the union, and that's one of the main points in this,\" Dunham said at the Met Gala in New York City on Monday night.\n\nActress Debra Winger said she would support any reasonable job action by the writers, but was mindful of the damage it would cause.\n\n\"I'm thinking of all the businesses that I work with at Warner Bros. for several months out of the year and (the) restaurants, shoe repair, dry cleaners,\" Winger said during an interview promoting her new film, \"The Lovers.\" ''The last writers' strike affected the city of Los Angeles in a devastating way.\"\n\nAt the Met Gala, CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves said he was guardedly optimistic that a deal would be reached without a strike.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Marcela Isaza in Los Angeles and Brooke Lefferts in New York contributed to this report.",

      "It was truly an 'amazing race' – and an amazing victory – for hockey-playing brothers Bates and Anthony Battaglia. The two defeated ten other teams in a race around the world to claim the top spot and the $1 million grand prize in the 22nd season of hit CBS TV show \"The Amazing Race.\"\n\nThis season's race spanned ten countries over five continents, with the contestants traveling over 30,000 miles. Starting in Los Angeles, contestants traveled to exotic locales like Bora Bora, New Zealand, Indonesia, Botswana, Switzerland, Germany, and the United Kingdom before returning stateside.\n\nBoth brothers made their careers playing hockey. Bates, originally drafted by the Ducks in 1994, spent ten seasons in the NHL with the Carolina Hurricanes, Colorado Avalanche, Washington Capitals, and Toronto Maple Leafs. In 580 career games, he has 80 goals and 198 points along with 385 penalty minutes. He was a part of the Canes' 2002 playoff run making it all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals. Anthony spent the majority of his career in the ECHL, suiting up for nine games in the Lowell Lock Monsters of the AHL in 2002-03. He won the Federal League Championship with the New Jersey Outlaws in 2012 and currently skates with the Huntsville Havoc of the Southern Professional Hockey League.\n\nAn extremely celebratory Bates and Anthony Battaglia joined us to talk about their Amazing Race victory.\n\nSo, what was it like to win?\n\nANTHONY: \"100% last night, that was my Stanley Cup. Bates played in the Stanley Cup Finals [in 2002 with the Carolina Hurricanes]. For me, it felt like I won the Cup last night. I've never felt anything like that before. Nothing else I can compare it to – that was my Stanley Cup.\"\n\nIn the season finale, Bates shared his brother's feelings, saying, \"I can't remember the last time I felt like this. It hasn't come from hockey in a long time, so it's pretty amazing.\"\n\nWhile they didn't have any set plans on how to spend their winnings, Bates had some suggestions on how his little brother could use a portion of the prize money.\n\nBATES: \"Maybe he can get his teeth fixed You know, he can eat corn on the cob through a picket fence. He uses rope as dental floss.\" That's some brotherly love, right there.\n\nWhat was your most frustrating moment in the Race?\n\nBATES: \"[At the restaurant serving challenge in the season finale], I was bringing the thunder, delivering the food. Anthony didn't know what chartreuse looked like. I didn't know what chartreuse looked like. What color is chartreuse?! We figured out, though, and we were good to go after to that.\"\n\nSo good, in fact, that Anthony even threw a bone to Roller Derby Moms Mona and Beth to help them along, giving them a key clue as to how the menu worked for the evening's dinner service.\n\nANTHONY: \"I was trying to be as vague as possible and still help them out.\"\n\nDid you see them making it as far as they did? Any surprises in the final three teams?\n\nBATES: \"Max and Katie, the country girls, and us – that would have been the perfect finale. The perfect sexy six. The Roller Girls, though, I think they were the strongest team out there, other than us.\"\n\nThe Battaglia brothers won an impressive four legs of the race, taking home trips to London, Bora Bora, and Thailand.\n\nOf all the different stops you made, which country was your favorite?\n\nANTHONY: \"Africa was pretty cool. I just love being able to tell people that I've water-skied with crocodiles. I don't care what anyone says. I saw the crocodiles. They were there. I was pretty scared. Bates is the worst water-skier anywhere. Worse than John Candy in 'The Great Outdoors'.\"\n\nBATES: \"I'm okay with that.\"\n\nANTHONY: \"You know what though, he did it. I'm super proud of him.\"\n\nWas there ever a time when you thought you might be eliminated?\n\nANTHONY: \"Berlin. I really didn't think that we were going to make it.\"\n\nBates had his travel bag stolen on the train en route to the city. While performing a challenge that involved moving large neon letters through the streets, one of the boys' letters fell and cracked, leaving them to go back and build a toy train track instead — somewhat reminiscent of the Hanson brothers with their slot cars in Slap Shot — before continuing on.\n\nANTHONY: \"I was Debbie Downer the entire time and Bates was trying to keep us going. I just thought",
      "Liberal comedian Jon Stewart on Tuesday ranted at anyone who isn't happy with the politicized tone of late night comedy, telling the New York Times: \"Tough shit.\" Of course, he also slimed conservatives as bigots for objecting to the angry liberalism of Jimmy Kimmel or Seth Meyers: \"The people that say, 'This culture isn't for me,' live in a nostalgic world. Those are the people that are the first to tell minorities, 'Suck it up.'\"\n\nTimes journalist Dave Itzkoff wondered, \"For people who don't share your politics and feel alienated by what they see in TV comedy — who wish we could go back to a more evenhanded era of Johnny Carson — do they have a point?\"\n\nStewart sneered, \"Here's what I would say: Tough shit. Honestly. The idea that you've lost the pleasure of watching Carson? We all have lost that pleasure. I used to like watching Carson, too. But I think that's a cop-out.\"\n\nUnnecessary, pointless nostalgia? Journalists were the first people to mourn the loss of Stewart's \"voice\" and \"fearlessness\" after he left The Daily Show. Hillary Clinton praised the liberal comic in 2015: \"Missing Jon Stewart already.\"\n\n\nAnd let's not forget that journalists are still whining about the loss of Walter Cronkite, the \"arbiter of truth.\" In 2016, journalist Lesley Stahl mourned, \"Uncle Walter had dominated, certainly CBS, but in a way, the country. People used to say he was the most trusted man in the country.\" Keep in mind, Cronkite stopped anchoring the news in 1981.\n\nSo, maybe, just maybe, liberals aren't in a position to judge those not willing to embrace modern media.\n\nHere's the full question and answer from Tuesday's New York Times:\n\n<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>",

      "I received a nice letter which reads:\n\nI hope the start of your first school year is going well! i've never participated in this specific exchange before, but i think it is such a great idea. The main reason i signed up for the exchange is because my two best friends and roommates in college were both elementary education majors, and they just started their first year of teaching as well! they teach 4th and 5th grade. They are fortunately in a couple of pretty good districts and don't need assistance, so i thought it's be fun to give to someone else in honor of them. i'm super excited to be paired with you since you are a new teacher too! I was also excited to see that when i looked up your address, you are near Houston and Sugarland. I just visited Houston for the first time this past March for that ncaa tournament regional games and stayed in Sugarland because i have a friend from there. Houston was such a great time! As far as the supplies gift... I know you were probably disappointed when you didn't see a bunch of boxes of notebooks on your doorstep. please let me explain. When i searched online for notebooks, the prices were super high. When i went into the store, the notebooks were cheap, but the shipping costs would have taken away from the amount of money i could afford to spend on your supplies. Instead, I have decided to send a gift card with the hope that you can purchase the supplies locally. This way you can also customize what you get. I hope you're getting into the groove of school- i know my teacher friends have been very busy during these first few weeks of school. i wish you the best for the rest of the school year and in your future career as a teacher. it takes a very special intelligent and caring person to become a teacher, so thank you very much for choosing the profession you did.\n\nYour secret santa, Jackoff814\n\nP.S If you feel inclined, i would love an update of how your school year goes or if you need anything else, i'd be happy to help!\n\nI received this letter along with a $70 gift card to Walmart, and a cool IOWA coozy. I then proceeded to go to Walmart that night and buy every single $0.17 spiral they had all 264 of them. And plan on spending the remainder 21$ on the card on other supplies like pencils, loose leaf paper, and glue.\n\nI am overwhelmed by the response. I was honestly expecting someone to go to walmart during $0.10 spiral sale get 50 then send that. This was WAY more than i expected. From the bottom of my heart THANK YOU!",
      "Ceres was classified as a dwarf planet, but it's also considered an asteroid. Discovered on January 1, 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, Ceres has a diameter of 950 km and it is by far the largest and most massive asteroid from the asteroid belt, containing one third of the total mass of the asteroid belt.\n\nIts surface, probably, contains a mixture of frozen water and various mineral and beneath it, is likely to be an ocean of liquid water makes it a possible target in the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\nAfter discovering the trans Neptunian object – Eris, it was proposed to bring Ceres the status of planet along with Charon and Eris. However, on 24 August 2006, another proposal made Ceres to become a dwarf planet. It is not known if they will keep Ceres at the status of asteroid.\n\nCeres lies about 2.8 Astronomics Units from the Sun, that is mean 419 million km. It's Size and weight are sufficient to give it a spherical shape, so it has a hydrostatic equilibrium, one of the important characteristics of dwarf planets.\n\nThere are indices that Ceres would have a thin atmosphere and on the surface exist frozen water. Ceres orbits the Sun once every 4.6 years. The orbit is slightly inclined and moderately eccentric. Ceres has a magnitude of about 6.7 and can thus be easily observed with an amateur telescope, with binoculars or in exceptional circumstances, with the naked eye.\n\nCeres is a major member of the solar system and learning about it is intriguing. You never go wrong with new knowledge.\n\nSaid Fred Taylor, Halley professor of physics at Oxford University.",
      "Days before the Federal Communication Commission votes on new rules designed to protect internet access, a House hearing served as a reminder of just how rare the expected victory for Net Neutrality supporters is in a town beholden to the interests of deep-pocketed industry lobbyists.\n\nIt's actually what happened before Tuesday's House Energy and Commerce hearing on internet regulations that highlighted the significance of the grassroots movement's likely coming achievement.\n\nVideo provided to The Sentinel by Demand Progress, a public interest organization calling for strong Net Neutrality rules, showed what's fairly commonplace around Capitol Hill: a long line stretching down the hall outside the committee's enclave on the second floor of the Rayburn House office building.\n\nThough not everyone in line was planning to attend the hearing.\n\n\"What was noticeable today was that the first 20 or so spots were all reserved by telecom lobbyists,\" said Nathan White, who captured the video, which shows individuals lined up against the wall, with signs at their shoes depicting the names of various DC influencers, lobbying firms, and industries including AT&T. It's similar to a line of chauffeurs waiting outside the airport's gates.\n\n\"They were all – literally- paying to have a place in the room,\" White, a former Congressional aide to ex-Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), said.\n\nIn the video, a man in a suit and a woman in a long coat with what looks like a Louis Vuitton bag approach another man in sneakers and slacks standing in line. After the two identify themselves, a woman can be heard saying, \"Appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Have a great day,\" as the third man gathers his belongings and gives up his spot toward the front of the line.\n\nIn \"This Town\" you can get paid to stand in line for lobbyists before Congressional hearings, and it happens frequently. As the Sunlight Foundation has previously reported, companies like LineStanding.com offer line-holders for between $10 and $35 an hour, which is how elbow-twisters from K Street manage to secure front row seats at jam-packed hearings without having to stand for hours next to the riff-raff–regular people, like interested citizens, independent journalist, and activists who also want to claim a seat.\n\n\"Immediately after the people who paid to be in the room, were the activists on Team Internet who spend the time and effort to show up and insist on getting into the room,\" White noted, summing up what's been a constant uphill battle for Net Neutrality activists who, over the last decade, have been outspent by opponents of the policy by a near 3-to-1 margin, according to the Sunlight Foundation.\n\nDespite the spending disadvantage and the lack of access compared to K Street influencers, \"Team Internet\" has done a remarkable job illuminating the importance of the issue to the American public, which has in turn pressured institutions in Washington, DC to act.\n\nOn Thursday, the FCC is expected to pass a proposal put forward by Chairman Tom Wheeler, which includes reclassification of the internet under Title II of the Communications Act. The reform didn't seem possible just a few years ago, but became a reality only after years of prodding that eventually forced the chairman to take this stronger position. For years, he had endorsed weaker policy approaches toward protecting equal access to the net.\n\nWheeler's proposal will give the commission more authority to protect the internet from service providers who see a benefit in carving up the web, adding tolls and constructing fast lanes that harm consumers and start-ups – a near total victory for Net Neutrality proponents.\n\n\"It's fairly symbolic of the way this fight has played out over the last year,\" White said of contracted line standing outside Wednesday's hearing.\n\n\"The telecom lobbyists pay to get to the front of the line, but then they're shocked when the people still manage to get in and make their voice heard.\"",
      "CHICAGO – APRIL 29:Washington Wizards guard John Wall (2) looks for the foul call during the first half of game five of the NBA play-offs between the Washington Wizards and the Chicago Bulls at the United Center on Tuesday, April 29, 2014.

He drinks McDonald's hot chocolate.\n\n\"I've been doing this since I was little,\" he said after Wizards practice on Thursday. \"Even in the summer time when it be hot as hell, I'll be still drinking it.\"\n\nSpecifically, he drinks two large-sized hot chocolates. Like, every day. Of the year.\n\n\"I just like hot chocolate that much,\" he explained. \"It's a habit. I have one before the game and one in the morning. If I don't get one in the morning [on off days], I'll at least get two after practice to go home.\"\n\nSomeone suggested that Wall adds extra sugar packets to the McDonald's drink; \"only like one or two,\" he said. \"Not too much. They make it extra chocolatey and stuff, so it's good.\"\n\nAnd teammates are well aware of Wall's habit.\n\n\"All the time,\" Garrett Temple said. \"He has to have his hot chocolate before the game. It gets him up.

      "As with PFOS and PFOA, the EPA has evidence that these shorter chain PFAS molecules accumulate in people's bodies and the environment, posing threats to both. Some of the studies showing the dangers of these persistent chemicals came from the manufacturers themselves, according to documents obtained by The Intercept.\n\nThough marketed as environmentally responsible, this new foam contains PFAS chemicals based on slightly shorter carbon chains — six, as opposed to eight, atoms. While many of these shorter compounds exit the human body more quickly, they still accumulate in blood and other tissues. And, like the longer compounds that have been the focus of environmental concerns across the country and around the world, these shorter molecules will persist indefinitely in the environment and never break down on their own.\n\nYet even as the Army, Navy, and Air Force have begun the slow process of addressing the contamination, which is expected to cost upwards of $2 billion, the Department of Defense isn't abandoning this line of chemicals. While some of the precise formulations that caused the contamination are off the table, the U.S. military is in the midst of an expensive effort to replace older foam with a newer formulation that contains only slightly tweaked versions of the same problematic compounds.\n\nContamination from the military's use of firefighting foam , or AFFF, isn't limited to Whidbey Island. The foam has been used on hundreds of bases around the country since at least the early 1970s to put out emergency blazes and, far more often, to douse fires purposefully set to prepare firefighters for those emergencies. Chemicals in the foam, known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances , or PFAS , have seeped into water in and around those bases. (PFOA and PFOS are just the two best-known examples of the much larger class of PFAS molecules.) Because mounting research links these chemicals with a host of health problems, including kidney, testicular, bladder, and prostate cancer, as well as immune, reproductive, and hormonal dysfunction, the contamination amounts to a \"seminal public health challenge,\" as Patrick Breysse, director of the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Environmental Health, recently described it.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by Anderson, \"Navy officials at NAS Whidbey Island, Navy Region Northwest and Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest are fully committed to the timely and successful cleanup of PFAS contamination, and will be involved until all required actions are complete.\"\n\n\"What the Navy is doing makes no sense,\" said Steven Swanson, a retired physician living near Farnsworth whose private well contained 440 ppt of PFOA. Swanson, who also has prostate issues, felt that the Navy didn't share his urgency about cleaning up the chemicals. \"They're just hoping this will die down, and people will get used to living with contaminated water.\"\n\nAfter testing their wells, the Navy provided Farnsworth and several of his neighbors whose wells tested positive for PFOS and PFOA with clean water. Spokesperson Lt. Ben Anderson said the Navy plans to continue providing bottled water and ultimately provide a clean water source to all affected families. But many on the island feel the response is an inadequate fix to the contamination that has upended many of their lives and decreased their property values.\n\nBecause of the contamination, Farnsworth worried that he wouldn't be able to sell his house — and decided not to put it on the market. Suddenly, a place that had been a haven felt more like a trap. \"We feel like we're hostage here,\" he said recently. The realization that he and his wife had been exposed to the chemicals, which have been linked to prostate cancer and thyroid diseases, cast the struggles they have had over the past years with these very diseases in a new light. \"I don't know what was related,\" he said.\n\nAfter a 30-year career, Farnsworth has an enduring love for the Navy. But last February, he discovered a toxic side to the Navy's presence in his life: His well, which he had used to water his fruit trees, cook, and fill his children's and grandchildren's glasses over the years, tested positive for three chemicals that had apparently seeped in from foam used for firefighting on the base. One chemical, PFOS, was present at 3,800 parts per trillion, more than 54 times a safety standard set by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2016.\n\nA bout an hour north of Seattle at the northern edge of Puget Sound, Whidbey Island is quiet, forested, and, in Bob Farnsworth's neighborhood, idyllic. In the 22 years he's lived on Whidbey, where he served as a command master chief at the Naval Air Base, Farnsworth, 61, has regularly crabbed and fished for salmon and enjoyed fruit from his own trees. His home, which he recently had appraised for $469,000, is less than a mile down a fir-tree lined road from",
      "UEFI has recently become a very public target for rootkits and malware. Last year at Black Hat 2012, Snare's insightful talk highlighted the real and very significant potential for developing UEFI rootkits that are very difficult, if not impossible, to detect and/or eradicate. Since then, a couple of practical bootkits have appeared.\n\nTo combat this new threat, we developed a Rootkit Detection Framework for UEFI (\"RDFU\") that incorporates a unified set of tools that address this problem across a wide spectrum of UEFI implementations. We will demonstrate a sample bootkit for Apple Mac OSX that was designed specifically for testing purposes. As a UEFI driver, it infects the Mac OSX kernel utilizing a UEFI \"rootkit\" technique. The entire infection process executes in memory (by the UEFI driver itself). Therefore, the bootkit does not need to install any OSX kernel extension modules. The bootkit demonstrates the following functionality:\n\nSniffing FileVault passwords (sniffing keys while booting)\n\nPrivilege escalation (to root)\n\nHiding PIDs, files and directories with selected pattern\n\nRootkit Detection Framework for UEFI was developed under DARPA CFT. Following this talk, we will publicly release the RDFU open source code along with whitepapers that outline a possible use case for this technology.\n\nDownload",
      "The disappearance of Joan Nattras Risch is a disturbing story, no matter which view of the case you believe. Either a troubled woman fled her life in what was probably a futile search for happiness, or she was the victim of a terrible crime that will never be avenged. In 1961, Risch lived in Lincoln, Massachusetts. She was married with two young children. On October 24 of that year, her husband Martin was away on a business trip in New York. (He was an executive in a paper company.) Neighbors described the couple--who had only lived in their home for six months--as \"quiet and reserved,\" but showing no visible signs of any domestic trouble.  That morning, Mrs. Risch did some routine errands. Two tradesmen who visited the home later that day recalled that she seemed in good spirits.  Around mid-day she settled her two-year-old son David in for a nap, and sent her four-year-old daughter Lillian to visit at the home of a neighbor. Around 2 pm, a neighbor glimpsed Joan in the Risch driveway.  She appeared to be \"walking fast or running and carrying something red.\" Lillian arrived home about two hours later. She soon returned to the neighbor's home, saying that her mother was gone, the baby was crying, and there was \"red paint all over the kitchen.\" What the child saw was not paint, but blood. It was type O, the same as Joan Risch's.  (Although it was never conclusively proved it was her blood.)  Investigators believed the blood came from a superficial wound which would not have been fatal.  The telephone receiver had been ripped from the wall, and a telephone directory lay open at the section showing emergency numbers.  (No such calls had been made.) A kitchen chair was overturned.  Risch's son was still safely upstairs in his crib, and the house was otherwise undisturbed.  Curiously, considering all the blood, there were no bloody footprints anywhere.  Unidentifiable bloody finger and palm prints were found on the wall.  There are conflicting reports about those prints.  Some accounts state that they were from an unknown intruder.  Others say that there was no record on file anywhere of Risch's fingerprints, making it impossible to say if they were hers, or some stranger's. Drops of blood led from her son's nursery to the kitchen, and then out to her car on the driveway. It was also noted that someone had made an attempt to mop up the blood with a pair of little David's overalls and some paper towels.  The trench coat Joan had worn earlier in the day was in a closet, but her cloth coat was missing.  Her purse and other belongings were also still in the house. Neighbors later reported that an unfamiliar blue/gray sedan was parked in the Risch driveway around 3 pm, although investigators decided that what they had seen was an unmarked police car parked there some time later. (These witnesses, however, continued to insist the car had been there before police were summoned.) Later that day, other witnesses saw a disheveled woman generally matching Risch's description walking aimlessly along a nearby site where a highway was being constructed. Her legs were covered either in reddish mud or blood.  Unfortunately, no one stopped to talk to her. That is the last we know of Joan Risch. It is anyone's guess what happened to her or where she went. Her husband was questioned by police, but nothing was found to connect him to his wife's disappearance, and he was quickly eliminated from suspicion. However, this left police with no possible suspects at all, and they began to publicly suggest she had left voluntarily, possibly \"for medical treatment.\"  They pointed to the lack of evidence there had been an intruder, and declared that \"certain key persons\" in the case were not telling authorities all they knew. One day early in November, an unknown woman called the Risch home at least twelve times.  The calls were answered by the missing woman's father-in-law, who reported that the caller refused to speak to him.  One of the Risch's neighbors said that on that same day, a \"terribly excited\" woman called her, complaining that she had been calling the Risch house, but had not been able to contact anyone she knew.  This neighbor claimed that she had gotten a similar call the day after Mrs. Risch disappeared.  This mystery-within-a-mystery was never solved, or at least publicly explained. The investigation into her presumed kidnapping took an even more peculiar turn when it was learned that in the months prior to her vanishing, she had obtained from the library at least 25 books dealing with murder or disappearances. One book she checked out revolved around a woman who vanished, leaving nothing behind but blood stains that had been smeared with a",
      "Further Reading Swedish authorities to question Julian Assange at embassy The Supreme Court of Sweden has rejected WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's appeal that his detention order be annulled, concurring with a lower appellate court.\n\nAccording to a nine-page Swedish-language opinion released Monday, the Supreme Court found that there is no reason to reverse the order (Google Translate), with one of the five judges dissenting.\n\n\"We are of course disappointed and critical of the Supreme Court's way of handling the case,\" Assange's lawyer Per Samuelson told Reuters. \"This decision has been taken without letting us close our argument.\"\n\nAssange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for nearly three years, has been accused of but not formally charged with committing sex crimes in Sweden. He almost certainly will be arrested by British authorities and extradited to Sweden should he set foot outside the embassy. Assange and his lawyers argue that Swedish authorities will extradite him on to the United States where he would face prosecution for documents published on WikiLeaks.\n\nAs Ars reported previously in March 2015, the Swedish prosecutor leading the Assange investigation finally agreed to question him inside the embassy. The statute of limitations on the crimes Assange is suspected of committing will expire in August 2015.\n\nThe Office of the Director of Public Prosecution, Marianne Ny, wrote on its website (Google Translate) that Ny had no further comment.",
      "A new more insidious wage rort is sweeping the nation's biggest convenience chain. Photo: Arsineh Houspian According to one Sydney-based employee the cash is collected outside the store by a representative of the franchisee. The employee said the payslip reflects a payment of $25 or more an hour, which is within the award rate, but the agreed amount between the employee and franchisee is a lesser sum. The scam is sweeping the country, with numerous workers discussing variations on the \"cash scam\" theme. For instance, a permanent resident might pay back a smaller amount than a worker on a student visa who is only allowed to work 20 hours a week under the visa conditions.\n\nAs one store manager says: \"Imagine working for $12 an hour and being taxed for $20 an hour or more. I didn't think they could get more odious but I was wrong.\" Pranay Alawala, a former 7-Eleven worker in Brisbane who recently confronted his boss to pay back more than $40,000 to himself and a few other workers, said he had been contacted by many workers who have got caught up in the \"cash scam\". Text messages between a franchisee and a 7-Eleven employee from a Brisbane store leave no doubt that this new fraud is widespread. The \"half pay scam\" morphed into its new abomination last month when head office became aware that ABC's Four Corners and Fairfax Media were investigating wage fraud and started trying to cover itself by cracking down on payroll compliance, including making sure franchisees had their bookwork \"correct\". If they refuse to play ball, they lose their job and are threatened with deportation.\n\nBetween July and August head office audited 225 stores and found 69 per cent had payroll compliance issues including gross underpayment of staff, falsification of payroll records and in at least one case a franchisee holding the passport and drivers licence of an employee without their permission. Consumer advocate Michael Fraser has been in contact with many workers and says the latest scam is evidence that 7-Eleven franchisees are highly organised from the top down and quickly adapt to anything interfering with their wage model. \"Now that they are expected to pay the correct wages – at least while the media is watching – they have had to adapt,\" he said. He said he had been contacted by text, email and on the phone by concerned staff from every state that 7-Eleven operate in that are now having to pay back half of their wages. Mr Fraser is advising them to keep a personal diary at home with all hours worked, how much they were paid and how much they were told to pay back. If there is any money withdrawn from an ATM, he is telling them to keep the receipt with the diary.\n\nThe new scam will be difficult to prove and could be an additional challenge for the independent panel that has been set up by 7-Eleven to investigate underpayment of wages. The panel, headed by former ACCC chairman Allan Fels, a fierce critic of the 7-Eleven franchise model, will kick off this week. Mr Fels hit the headlines a week ago when he said \"the only way a franchisee can make a go of it in most cases is by underpaying wages, by illegal behaviour.\" Workers are invited to come forward if they have been underpaid and the panel will assess their claims, but the success or otherwise of the panel will depend on whether they are given amnesty by the Abbott government and whether the onus is on the worker to prove their case, or the franchisee and 7-Eleven head office. Remember, most of the payroll records and rosters have been falsified, other documents shredded and many workers have been getting paid in cash, which would make it almost impossible for most workers to prove their case.",

      "The McGowan Government does not intend to proceed with former premier Colin Barnett's plan for an open-range zoo in Lower Chittering.\n\nEnvironment Minister Stephen Dawson this week confirmed the development of the open-range concept was not part of the Labor Government's election commitments.\n\nMr Barnett's plan was to use 700ha of land vested with the Department of Parks and Wildlife in the embankments of the Avon Valley to display elephants, bears, lions, pygmy hippopotamuses, baboons, giraffes and Australian animals.\n\nCamera Icon The Barnett Government had announced the plan before the State election.\n\nIt was going to cost up to $200 million and take five to 10 years to get off the ground.\n\nIt was designed to allow Perth Zoo to expand its breeding programs because a city zoo cannot have big breeding herds.\n\nMr Barnett described the idea as a major boost to local tourism.\n\nAnimals at Perth Zoo were treated to an Easter egg hunt today The West Australian Play Video Video Animals at Perth Zoo were treated to an Easter egg hunt today\n\nIt was announced at the end of last year and, at the time, the Labor Opposition said it was \"a nice idea\" but amounted to \"desperate politics\" in the shadow of the State election.\n\nMr Dawson said Perth Zoo would continue to play an important role in regional and international breeding programs.\n\n\"They will still display a range of animals by caring for bachelor groups or animals not currently needed by other zoos for breeding,\" he said.\n\nCamera Icon The current Perth Zoo site was to remain open during the plan.\n\n\"Perth Zoo is constantly making improvements and upgrades, this includes an expansion for the African Savannah which will enable breeding of lions and the arrival of new female giraffes for breeding.\n\n\"All Perth Zoo animals receive best practice husbandry and health care to ensure their positive welfare.\"\n\nThe 119-year-old Perth Zoo attracted a record breaking 695,091 visitors in 2015-16.\n\nIt is home to more than 1530 animals representing 163 different species.",
      "There was an unusually large array of Abstract Expressionist paintings, in large part because Christie's had won property from the collection of David Pincus, the Philadelphia clothing manufacturer, who died in December, and his wife, Geraldine. Over their marriage of more than 50 years, the couple had collected paintings and sculptures by Rothko, Pollock, Newman and de Kooning.\n\nPhoto\n\nEvery major work drew a profusion of takers. Four telephone bidders went for the Rothko, by far the evening's biggest star. Measuring nearly 8 feet by 7 feet, it beat the previous record for the artist — set at Sotheby's in 2007 by David Rockfeller's \"White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose),\" from 1950 — by more than $15 million.\n\nPollock's \"Number 28, 1951,\" one of the artist's combinations of drip and brushwork in shades of silvery gray with red, yellow and shots of blue and white, sold to another telephone bidder for $20.5 million — $23 million with fees — within its estimated range of $20 million to $30 million. It was another record auction price for an artist.\n\nThe same was true for \"Onement V,\" a 1952 canvas by Newman, which also come from the Pincus collection. One of only two paintings from this series by the artist left in private hands — the four others are in American museums — it is a classic deep blue canvas with a feathery vertical strip, or \"zip,\" as the artist called his signature strokes, this one of aquamarine. Estimated at $10 million to $15 million, it went to a telephone bidder for $22.4 million.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It, too, brought a record price, selling for $36.4 million.\n\nPrices for Gerhard Richter have been soaring ever since his highly praised retrospective at the Tate Modern in London this winter, which is now at the Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery) in Berlin and will be heading to the Pompidou Center in Paris in June. And Christie's had a 1993 abstract canvas that brought out five bidders who simply did not want to give up. A few of them played games, bidding odd amounts, much to the amusement of Christopher Burge, the evening's auctioneer, who played along. The painting ended up going to Brett Gorvy, head of Christie's postwar and contemporary art department worldwide, who was bidding on behalf of an anonymous collector who ended up paying $21.8 million, above the high $18 million estimate and another record.\n\nThe sale also included many early sculptures by Calder. Among the best of them was a standing mobile called \"Lily of Force,\" from 1945, which was estimated to sell for $8 million to $12 million, and was bought by Daniella Luxembourg, a dealer, for $18.5 million — yet another record. Another mobile, the delicate, all-white \"Snow Flurry,\" from 1948, was estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million but made $10.3 million.\n\nNot everything fared quite so well. Cindy Sherman's \"Untitled #96,\" from 1981, was being sold by the Akron Art Museum to benefit its acquisitions fund. The photograph, in which the artist is posed on a linoleum floor, staring off in a reverie as she clutches a crumpled scrap of newspaper classified page, is part of an edition of 10. A year ago, another print from the edition brought a record price of almost $4 million, but on Tuesday night, Per Skarstedt, a New York dealer, bought it for $2.88 million.\n\nSome of the old-timers left Christie's shaking their heads over the stratospheric prices. \"I sold a red Rothko to the National Gallery of Berlin for $22,000,\" Richard Feigen said. But then again, that was in 1967.",
      "Image caption Song-ji High School allows board games to be part of the school curriculum\n\nSouth Korea's education system is globally renowned - a feverishly competitive national industry that churns out highly-motivated students and sends them to the world's top universities. But what happens if you do not fit the stereotype?\n\nIt is mid-morning at Song-ji High School, and inside a row of grey portable buildings, senior classes are under way.\n\nIn one of them, 30 students sit hunched around their tables - hooded tops pulled up over their heads, tattoos peeking from their cuffs.\n\nA group of girls are playing something called Love Roulette in a corner. Three boys are suspending tiny plastic monkeys from sticks, four people are fast asleep, one is combing her hair and several are occupied with their mobile phones.\n\nBoard games do not usually form part of the South Korean curriculum and tattoos are rarely as acceptable as school ties, but Song-ji is not your average school.\n\nIn the next-door cabin, the pop music class is in full swing. A band with drums and backing singers wobble through a recent hit song, to the enthusiastic encouragement of their music teacher.\n\nThey are barely in tune and the students read the lyrics off their mobile phones, but the emphasis at Song-ji is on participation, not perfection.\n\nBecause this is where students come when they fall off South Korea's education conveyor belt. And the teaching here is everything that Asia's traditional schools are not.\n\n'I got angry'\n\nSeung-hwan is a catering student at the school, a would-be chef with a diamante ear stud and a troubled past.\n\n\"There were too many regulations in my old school,\" he said. \"I had trouble sticking to them and I got angry.\n\n\"The only outlet I had was bullying and fighting other kids. My parents got angry, so I ran away from home and began to get into all kinds of bad things.\"\n\nAt Song-ji, he says that the teachers are not only more relaxed but crucially they teach at the students' own pace.\n\nThis is not the case in South Korea's mainstream education system - many schools here are achievement hot-houses.\n\nThe government has said that it wants less pressure and more extra-curricular activities for its students, but even young children often spend 12 hours or more each day studying.\n\nAnd with more than 80% of school-leavers entering higher education, it is getting more pressured, not less.\n\nMany students say it is getting harder to compete for grades, for university places and ultimately, for jobs.\n\nWe might let the students fall asleep in class - but we know that when they do wake up, they'll want to learn Kim Han-tae, Principal of Song-ji High School\n\nThe unemployment rate for young people is now twice the national average, and even students at top universities worry about what all those years of study will ultimately buy them.\n\nIt is no wonder, perhaps, that alternative schools like Song-ji are proving popular.\n\nA recent government report estimated that 40% of South Korea's mainstream students wanted to quit, and that number rises with age.\n\nSong-ji's principal, Kim Han-tae, says the country will see more dropouts, not less, unless the system changes.\n\n\"Public education these days is regressing because it's too rigid, too formulaic,\" he said.\n\n\"There's no improvement in content and the schools are not adapting to the students' changing needs, that's why the private sector is flourishing.\"\n\nThe facilities at Song-ji might be inferior, he admits, but the school is serving an important purpose - helping students adapt and find talents outside the mainstream system.\n\n\"We might let the students fall asleep in class,\" he said. \"But we know that when they do wake up, they'll want to learn. Without schools like ours, they would be left behind, isolated, and create social problems.\"\n\n'Everyone graduates'\n\nAll of which might make the government grateful for schools like this one. But Mr Kim complains that there is little support and too many regulations for those offering alternative education.\n\nThere are fewer than 40 officially certified so-called alternative schools in Seoul, and there is some unease towards them. After all, they do not gel with South Korea's modern, international image.\n\nImage caption Students learn at their own pace at Song-ji High School\n\nIn fact, 50 years ago, education was patchy and low-priority for all but society's elite. And the economic boom in the country was so fast that many of today's entrepreneurs had little formal education.\n\nKim An-sook has run a successful car-repair workshop for decades. She became a student at Song-ji High School in the 1950",

      "Hillary Clinton makes an appearance at Temple University in Philadelphia on Sept 19. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Saturday, a lead headline in the New York Times announced, \"Clinton Team Steels Against Email Fallout.\" With FBI Director James B. Comey's letter the previous day announcing the discovery of a new trove of emails linked to Hillary Clinton's private server, a potential \"October surprise\" had finally arrived.\n\nYet it shouldn't have been a \"surprise\" at all. Why not? The answer, somewhat ironically, appeared in a Washington Post headline the next day: \"FBI email probe has upended the 'Clinton is coasting to victory' media narrative.\"\n\nThe media's urgency to maintain drama in an election that was increasingly looking like a blowout made this story all but inevitable.\n\nBy definition, to be \"news,\" a story must be new. Pursuit of novel stories is thus a core media news value. A dramatic horse race in which the outcome is uncertain and continually fluctuating is perpetually novel. Additional stories about the candidates' long-standing policy positions? Not so much.\n\nSo media coverage of presidential elections disproportionately emphasizes the horse race. Research by Harvard University's Shorenstein Center, for instance, shows that during the 2016 primary season, 56 percent of news coverage of the campaign focused on the horse race, compared with just 11 percent on substantive policy concerns.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the email story? This story raises the possibility of halting the \"blowout\" narrative and replacing it with an unpredictable (hence novel) horse race. This keeps the audience engaged.\n\nWe counted the number of stories mentioning the phrase \"Clinton email\" between Aug. 1 and Oct. 27 — the day before Comey's latest bombshell — appearing in all news broadcast transcripts (television and radio) available in Lexis-Nexis. We then compared this trend with the polling average on RealClearPolitics (RCP).\n\n\n(Graph by Matthew Baum and Phil Gussim)\n\nThe two trends are strongly and statistically significantly correlated (.33 where the maximum positive correlation is 1.0). As Clinton's lead in the polls goes up, the number of stories mentioning \"Clinton email\" follows suit. As her lead declines, the frequency of such stories declines as well.\n\nThus, when Clinton's lead increases, making it seem more likely that she will decisively defeat Trump, news outlets seeking to sustain the horse-race narrative find it opportune to reexamine what has consistently proven to be the most damaging story line for the Clinton campaign. Conversely, when her lead shrinks and the horse race appears competitive, the email story loses some of its luster — at least absent a new revelation, like Comey's letter to Congress.\n\nCould email stories be driving the polls, rather than the other way around? Only if one believes that more stories focusing on Clinton's email troubles tends to push her poll numbers higher, which seems unlikely on its face. Consistent with this logic, we find that polls predict news coverage more strongly than news coverage predicts Clinton's poll numbers.\n\nBut perhaps the real culprit is WikiLeaks, strategically releasing hacked emails, and thereby demanding media attention, whenever Clinton's lead expands. For instance, the Oct. 7 release of emails belonging to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta followed a week during which Clinton's lead in RCP's polling average expanded from 2.7 to 4.7 points. On the day of the release, stories mentioning \"Clinton email\" doubled from the previous day. Yet over the next several days, attention to her emails fell off sharply, suggesting that WikiLeaks failed to drive the media narrative, at least beyond a single day.\n\nSo while the latest turn in the saga of Hillary Clinton's emails was unforeseeable, the media's renewed interest in the email story was not. Given Clinton's recent lead in the horse race, the fact that we are again talking about this issue a week before the election is no surprise at all.\n\nMatthew A.

      "PANCHKULA/CHANDIGARH: Over 10,000 followers of the Dera Sacha Sauda sect have entered Panchkula despite prohibitory orders ahead of a court verdict this Friday in an alleged rape case against chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh , and police personnel are on alert amid apprehensions of unrest. According to intelligence inputs, around 10 lakh dera followers are expected to gather in Panchkula, Chandigarh, Mohali — or Tricity — on the day of the verdict. The CBI court has ordered the dera chief to be present in court.The Punjab DGP (law and order) on Tuesday issued a letter to the force, saying the followers were stocking \"petrol, diesel, sharp-edged weapons and stones\" to create a law and order situation if the court verdict goes against the dera chief. Panchkula deputy commissioner Gauri Prasher Joshi told TOI that all hotels, guest houses and dharamshalas were being checked as part of their security drive, adding that no one was allowed to rent a room in the district without police verification.In Chandigarh, a cricket stadium at Sector 16 that served as the training ground for the likes of Kapil Dev and Yuvraj Singh will be converted into a temporary jail on August 25 to detain dera followerswho arrive for the verdict. They will be released, a cop said, when the \"situation normalises\". The stadium can accommodate over 20,000 people. SSP Nilamabri Vijay Jagdale said, on Friday, over 3,500 cops would be deployed in the city and on borders with Punjab and Haryana. Seven companies of paramilitary forces have been requested from the Centre, and leaves of all cops cancelled till August 31.",

      "About the Book\n\nTyranny comes in many guises, and tyrants will thrive in palaces and one room hovels, in back alleys and playgrounds. Tyrants abound on the verges of civilization, where disorder frays the rule of civil conduct, and all propriety surrenders to brutal imposition. Millions are made to kneel and yet more millions die horrible deaths in a welter of suffering and misery.\n\nBut we'll leave all that behind as we plunge into escapist fantasy of the most irrelevant kind, and in the ragged wake of the tale told in Lees of Laughter's End, our most civil adventurers, Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, along with their suitably phlegmatic manservant, Emancipor Reese, make gentle landing upon a peaceful beach, beneath a quaint village above the strand and lying at the foot of a majestic castle, and therein make acquaintance with the soft-hearted and generous folk of Spendrugle, which lies at the mouth of the Blear River and falls under the benign rule of the Lord of Wurms in his lovely keep.\n\nMake welcome, then, to Spendrugle's memorable residents, including the man who should have stayed dead, the woman whose prayers should never have been answered, the tax collector everyone ignores, the ex-husband town militiaman who never married, the beachcomber who lives in his own beard, and the now singular lizard cat who used to be plural, and the girl who likes to pee in your lap. And of course, hovering over all, the denizen of the castle keep, Lord –\n\nAh, but there lies this tale, and so endeth this blurb, with one last observation: when tyrants collide, they have dinner.\n\nAnd a good time is had by all.\n\n208 pages (paperback)\n\nPublished on July 8, 2014\n\nPublished by Tor\n\nAuthor's webpage\n\nThis book was sent for me to review by the publisher.\n\n—\n\nI'm a huge Steven Erikson fan. That's no secret to anyone who has even a passing interest in my website. The man does epic fantasy right. I love his characters, his magic, and the staggering depth of his world. However, until now, I have never read one of his novellas. I'm still suffering from some weird sort of book hangover from the end of the Malazan series, and I never really wanted to find out what Erikson could do with a novella. I wasn't sure that the man's talent could be parsed into something smaller. I stayed away from them.\n\nUntil now.\n\nIt probably wasn't the best idea for me to start off with the fifth novella in this series of Bauchelian and Korbal Broach stories. I can pretty much guarantee you that if you aren't already familiar with the Malazan world, a lot of the nuances here might be lost on you. However, I am familiar with the Malazan world, and I loved these two characters when I ran across them in that series. I decided that my novella experience with Erikson would start with this book and….\n\nI really loved it.\n\nI can't speak for the rest of the series of novellas, but The Wurms of Blearmouth felt like a stand-alone story, chapters that could have fit into the overall Malazan saga, but were left out to stand on their own for one reason or another. While that may or may not actually be the case (I really don't know), it works well. Erikson felt a lot more lighthearted in this novella than I expected, and that really let me sit back and just enjoy this novella. This novel is akin to cake. You start it knowing you'll like it. Pretty soon you've eaten half the cake and all you can think about is how you want more, more, more!\n\nBauchelian and Korbal Broach are names that will be instantly familiar to just about every Malazan reader. They were incredibly unique characters that stuck out for numerous reasons. They were weird, hard to pin down and fully understand, and had a dark subversive humor that instantly made me a fan. Erikson plays on all of those aspects of their characters in The Wurms of Blearmouth. He takes what he developed in his Malazan series (and I'm sure in previous novellas) and really runs with it. The thing is, despite the fact that this is a novella, not being hammered into the Malazan group of novels made the whole thing feel a lot more liberated and free than I expected.

This will help ensure you get the results you deserve.\n\nI'd go as far as to say it's the biggest differentiator between those that are successful and those that aren't.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause without proper tracking data, you won't be able to gauge whether or not you are progressing as hoped. You won't have objective data points from which to base your decisions off of when you stall in some area, and there is a good chance that you will get stuck spinning your wheels not knowing what to tweak to get yourself back on track.\n\nPerhaps you've already experienced this frustration?\n\nConsider the following:\n\nA lack of weight change does not necessarily mean that body fat hasn't been lost.\n\nA weight increase doesn't necessarily mean that body fat has been gained.\n\nWeight gain when bulking won't be from muscle alone.\n\nA lack of training progress doesn't necessarily mean that a training plan is to blame.\n\nBody fat measurement methods all have accuracy issues, so they can't be relied upon to gauge progress in the short term.\n\nIf the way you're currently tracking isn't sufficient to tease out the differences, then you need to improve it. Fortunately, this article is here to help. It will guide you through the art of proper progress tracking that I've developed over the last six and a half years from working with clients online. It is easy to understand, quick to implement, and I've included a spreadsheet tracker you can download also.\n\nThe tracking mistakes most people make:\n\n1. Are you weighing yourself just once per week? Don't do that. Your weight will fluctuate from day to day, and across the course of a day.\n\n2. Do you try to gauge progress by how you look in the mirror? Bad idea. The brain plays tricks on us by adapting perceptions to new levels of stimulation through a phenomenon known as \"perceptual adaptation.\" Oh and how defined you look condition will change from day to day your water balance and gut content fluctuate.\n\n3. Are you trying to measure your body fat percentage? Well, that's another seemingly great, but really bad idea. Body fat measurement methods all have accuracy and consistency issues. (I've written more about this here.)\n\nOver longer time frames, this is sufficient. In the shorter time frames where all the decisions need to happen, this is woefully inadequate, and will more than likely just leave you in the shit.\n\nThe Art of Proper Diet Progress Tracking\n\nThere are eight key ways I now get clients to track progress. The data points taken together will help you determine whether an adjustment to your diet or training is necessary. It's not perfect, but it will help you navigate the fluctuations in weight when dieting and bulking, help you determine whether you need to make an adjustment to your training, and stop you from doing something prematurely, screwing yourself up.\n\nThis is how your data will look if you track as per this guide:\n\nMany of the points I will make here may seem very obvious in isolation, but they are things easily missed or forgotten when making decisions in the heat of the moment. For extra detail, click these →1\n\nFor more useful graphics, check out my Instagram\n\n1. Weigh yourself every morning upon waking. Note the weekly average.\n\nDo it after going to the toilet. You can choose to do this at night, but most people will find a morning habit easier to stay consistent with.\n\nReasons\n\nScale weight will fluctuate day to day, and throughout each day. You can expect to lose 1-2% body weight overnight through the moisture lost when breathing. Here are other things that cause fluctuations in weight:\n\nWater & glycogen, due to a change in carb intake.\n\nWater, due to the stall-whoosh effect.\n\nWater, due to hydration status.\n\nWater, due to a change in salt intake.\n\nWater, due to stress or the menstrual cycle.\n\nBowel content, because some foods have a higher 'gut residue' (they stay in the gut for longer).\n\nClick for more detail.2\n\n2. Take circumference measurements in nine places, once per week, noting the measurements to the nearest 0.1 cm.\n\nAs with the scale weight, I suggest you measure in the morning when you wake up, after going to the toilet. I get clients to do this on a Saturday. Do it yourself rather than relying on a partner, as you are the only person that will always be with you. Two different people measuring with the same tape will get a slightly different result.\n\nTo help with consistency:\n\nConsider getting a Myotape/Orbitape",

      "A new project has found that when covering instances of torture, cable news refers to it via euphemisms (such as the Bush administration's preferred language \"enhanced interrogation techniques\") almost 75 percent of the time rather than actually using the word \"torture.\"\n\nThe study, published at CoveringTorture.org, monitored over thirty print, television, and online news sources for two years to develop an infographic of how frequently euphemisms for torture were used in place of the actual word. During the observed period of Oct. 2010 through Oct. 2012, the news wire services AP and Reuters fared the best when describing torture for what it is, using euphemistic terms only 43 and 37 percent of the time respectively.\n\nAmong the newspapers indexed in the infographic, the Wall Street Journal is by far the least likely to use the word \"torture\" in its reporting. The Washington Post fares slightly better, with the New York Times performing best, calling \"torture\" for what it is two-thirds of the time. Cable news networks scraped the bottom in the study's findings, with MSNBC proving the best of the bunch by calling torture by name only half of the time. Fox News used the term \"torture\" in place of other phrases only 21 percent of the time.\n\nAll of this matters as polling have shown that public opposition to the use of torture decreases when euphemisms such as \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" are used in the place of the actual word \"torture.\" Usage in the media may well have improved in the last few years, though. In a previous study on whether waterboarding was deemed torture by the media — conducted in 2010 by Harvard students — the major newspapers fared far worse, refusing to refer to the act as torture throughout the years of 2002–2006. As late as 2009, the Washington Post found itself in hot water for refusing to refer to waterboarding as torture because the Bush administration, apparently, would dispute that terminology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebate over torture and its use in extracting information has resumed following the release of Zero Dark Thirty, a film dramatizing the killing of Osama bin Laden. In the film, scenes are included showing waterboarding of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay facility and are reportedly depicted as being an integral part of locating bin Laden. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough on Monday revived the claim himself, saying \"the CIA program, whether you find it repugnant or not, actually was effective with KSM [9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed] and other people getting actionable intelligence.\" His statement comes despite experts and former Bush officials saying that waterboarding did no such thing.

      "Featured image: Dozens of people have been shot on sight by park guards in Kaziranga, including severely disabled tribal man Gaonbura Killing. © BBC\n\nby Survival International\n\nSurvival International has called on the UN expert on extrajudicial executions to condemn shoot on sight conservation policies.\n\nIn a letter to the Special Rapporteur charged with the issue, Survival stated that \"shoot on sight policies directly affect tribal people who live in or adjacent to 'protected areas'… particularly when park guards so often fail to distinguish subsistence hunters from commercial poachers.\"\n\nThe letter adds that \"nobody knows when wildlife officers are permitted to use lethal force against [suspected poachers], and it is impossible for dependents to hold to account officers whom they believe to have killed without good reason. Many countries have gone further, and granted wildlife officers immunity from prosecution.\"\n\nThe letter cites Kaziranga National Park in India as an especially striking example of the tactic. According to a recent BBC report, an estimated 106 people have been extrajudicially executed there in the last 20 years, including one disabled tribal man who had wandered over the park boundary to retrieve cattle.\n\nKaziranga guards have effective legal immunity from prosecution, and have admitted that they are instructed to shoot poaching suspects on sight. This has had serious consequences for tribal peoples living around the park. In June 2016, a seven-year-old tribal boy was shot and maimed for life by guards.\n\nSimilar policies are used in other parts of the world, notably Kenya, Tanzania and Botswana, among other African countries.\n\nSpeaking about his own anti-poaching work in Africa, poaching expert Rory Young from the organization Chengeta said: \"Shoot on sight is stupid. If we had been shooting on sight during this latest sting operation we would have shot a handful of poachers and that would have been the end of it. Every single poacher is an opportunity for information to get more poachers and work your way up the chain to the ringleaders.\"\n\nSurvival has asked the Special Rapporteur to clarify that shoot on sight violates fundamental rights enshrined in the UN's Civil and Political Rights Covenant and other international conventions. It also urges the UN to enquire about the policy with the Indian government, and the government of Assam state, where Kaziranga is located.\n\nShoot on sight is justified on the grounds that it helps to deter poachers. However, there have been several recent cases of guards and officials at Kaziranga being arrested for involvement in the illegal wildlife trade themselves.\n\nSurvival International is leading the fight against these abuses, and calling for a new conservation model that respects tribal peoples. Targeting tribal people diverts action away from tackling the true poachers – criminals conspiring with corrupt officials. Targeting tribal people harms conservation.\n\nSurvival's Director Stephen Corry said: \"If any other industry was guilty of this level of human rights abuses, there would be an international outcry. Why the silence when conservationists are involved? Torture and extrajudical killing is never justified – the law is clear on this. Some people think that the death of innocents is justified, that 'collateral damage' is necessary in the fight against poaching. We ask them, where is your humanity? Of course, there's a racist element at play here: Shoot on sight policies would be unthinkable in North America or Europe.\"",

      "by Ian Freeman\n\nIt has been a long road, but thanks to free speech attorney Jon Meyer and judge John C Kissinger of the Cheshire superior court, Keene's Robin Hooders are again victorious! Nearly two years ago, the same court dismissed the two cases brought against the charitable meter-feeders, alleging we were \"threatening, intimidating, and harassing\" their parking enforcement officers and demanding a 50ft floating, constitution-free buffer zone to protect them.\n\nThe city appealed to the NH supreme court which ultimately upheld the superior court's dismissal except for one part. They affirmed the lower court's ruling to dismiss based on free speech grounds, but said the superior court needed to look at the request for the \"buffer zone\" injunction separately from the allegations of \"tortious interference\", \"civil conspiracy\", \"negligence\", and the demand for financial compensation, all of which the city failed to prove to the court's satisfaction.\n\nThankfully, the superior court agreed with attorney Meyer's arguments and denied the city's request for any injunction against us whatsoever! This effectively kills their case, unless they decide to continue spending ridiculous amounts of taxpayer money to appeal this latest failure to the NH supreme court.\n\nThe city, which had originally wanted a 50 foot floating buffer zone around each enforcer that would prevent all speech and recording by the Robin Hooders, had whittled that down over the 2.5 years this has been in court to a 5-10ft zone that would only be temporary and only if the parking enforcer requested said distance from the Robin Hooder. Mind you, we generally do not wish to be so close to them — it's best to fill meters at a greater distance, so as to have enough time to fill the meter and leave the Robin Hood calling card on the windshield, BEFORE the parking enforcer catches up to us and gets ahead. That would mean she could successfully write a ticket if she gets ahead, so having distance is my goal, but the enforcer is constantly trying to close that gap, so sometimes we do get within ten feet. That would mean that such an injunction (besides being unconstitutional) would also prevent us from Robin Hooding, as anytime the enforcer managed to close the gap, we'd be subject to arrest for \"contempt of court\".\n\nIn a fifteen-page order issued on 11/20, Kissinger writes of the city's request for injunction:\n\nThe Court cannot conceive of any more narrow or alternative relief that would provide any meaningful protection to the PEOs without running afoul of the Respondents' First Amendment rights…the government interests here are not sufficient to warrant an infringement on the Respondents' First Amendment rights. Any injunction requiring a buffer zone of any meaningful distance would require a significant change in the method used by the Respondents to disseminate their protected speech.\n\nSo, despite the city's interests in their parking enforcement continuing unabated, their significantly-reduced proposal for injunction is still beyond what is constitutionally permissible, and further, the court could not think of any lesser restrictions that would pass constitutional muster.\n\nKissinger, in his conclusion, does remind the city that if Robin Hooders' conduct is rising to the level of violating criminal statutes, that they can bring such charges. Of course, the reason they never have brought criminal harassment or assault charges is because Robin Hooders are peaceful. There is zero evidence of \"harassing, threatening, or intimidating\" — the claims the city has long libeled us with throughout this lawsuit.\n\nIn a classic case of projection, the people in this who are actually harassing, threatening, and intimidating others are the parking enforcers. They harass, threaten, and intimidate the good motorists of Keene six days a week by giving them threatening tickets for just trying to do some business downtown. Those tickets threaten, intimidate, and harass their victims into paying their fines so as to avoid the threat of having their car stolen. Talk about intimidation! This is why Robin Hood of Keene exists — we are here to save people from having to deal with the city's threats. That's always been the primary motivation, at least for me. I certainly don't speak for everyone.\n\nIf the parking enforcers don't like being called out for their threatening, intimidating, and harassing behavior, they should get jobs in the productive economy. Until the city council ends the parking department and turns over the spaces to downtown businesses to decide how to administer, per market forces, Robin Hooding will continue to rescue peaceful motorists from the threats of the city government.\n\nThe city has 30 days to appeal this latest failure.",

      "With the Pittsburgh Steelers facing salary cap troubles this offseason, linebacker James Harrison is willing to rework his contract. Harrison is scheduled to earn $6.57 million in 2013 and $7.57 million in 2014 and although he is willing to restructure, he is unwilling to take a pay cut which may make it hard to keep him in Pittsburgh.\n\nHarrison, 35, has been with the Steelers for his entire NFL career, making five consecutive Pro Bowls from 2007-2011. The 2008 Defensive Player of the Year is one of the most popular players in Pittsburgh and a team leader, but if the two sides can't find a way to reduce his $6.5 million salary next season Harrison could be on his way out.\n\nFor more on this story, visit Behind the Steel Curtain\n\nThe Steelers are roughly $14 million over the 2013 salary cap and will need to make significant moves to get back under the cap. Harrison is due the fourth highest salary on the team in 2013 at a number higher than the Steelers can afford and if Pittsburgh was to cut him they would save $5.1 million in cap relief. They will need to restructure several contracts and cut players in order to get below the cap.\n\nAlthough there is a financial gain from cutting Harrison, he remains one of the Steelers top linebackers, making it a hard decision. Last season, Harrison missed the first three games of the season due to a knee injury, but he recorded 49 tackles and six sacks in 13 games. Both totals were the lowest since Harrison's breakout season in 2007, but still solid numbers for an outside linebacker.\n\nThrough his years of high-level performance and emotional leadership on the field, Harrison will be best remembered for making one of the greatest plays in Super Bowl history. In Super Bowl XLIII, Harrison intercepted Kurt Warner on the goal line at the end of the first half and took the ball 100 yards down the field for the score. That play would cement Harrison's place as a Steelers' legend and prove to be the difference in the game as the Steelers defeated the Cardinals 27-23.\n\nDespite Harrison's significant impact on the history of the Steelers, football decisions can't be made from an emotional standpoint. Pittsburgh would love to keep Harrison, but to do so they'll almost certainly need him to come in at a lower cap number than $6.5 million in 2013. Neil Coolong of Behind the Steel Curtain believes Harrison will have to accept less money to stay in Pittsburgh.\n\nIt's an unfortunate reality, but the only way it seems Harrison will be with the Steelers in 2013 is if he accepts a deal like nose tackle Casey Hampton signed last year, which essentially cut his salary and guaranteed him one more season.\n\nMeanwhile Harrison's agent Bill Parise hopes a new deal can be reached to keep Harrison in Pittsburgh, but isn't willing to take less money, \"Can we help the Steelers by restructuring James' contract? We're certainly willing to do that. Do we need to take less money? I don't think so. Personally, I think he's a bargain.\"\n\nIf Pittsburgh lets Harrison walk, where would they turn for a replacement? Jason Worilds has been Harrison's backup, but the 24-year-old has injury concerns of his own. Last season the former second-round pick recorded 23 tackles and five sacks and is certainly a cheaper option than Harrison.\n\nThe Steelers could also use the 17th pick in the 2013 NFL Draft to find a replacement for Harrison, but they have several holes to fill, particularly along both lines. Mocking the Draft has Pittsburgh selecting Alabama defensive tackle Jesse Williams out of Alabama. With so many needs, the Steelers would like to not have to worry about addressing their linebackers via the draft, but if Harrison doesn't take a pay cut, it could force their hand.",
      "The MythBusters show is all about the crazy stuff that happens when technology meets man. In fact, we go out of our way to think of creative ways to play with technology. My MythBuster partner, Adam Savage, has just about every kind of iPod, iPhone and iPipewrench he can get his mitts on. But there are times when innovation produces aggravation, and when that happens, technology can flat out drive us nuts.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nIt's true that sometimes complexity is unavoidable, or even desirable: A cellphone that can give you directions and the weather can be quite useful, but new features should never come at the expense of core functionality--the cellphone should still be able to make a call easily. That's why, as machines become more complicated, good interface design becomes more essential--you can't just keep adding buttons and menus.\n\nThe iPhone is a good example. To combine several machines into a pocket-size device, Apple did away with almost all the buttons in favor of a touchscreen that can be reconfigured for each new application. Personally, I have no use for anything fancier than a basic cellphone, but the iPhone is smart technology.\n\nHere are some prime examples of technology that's not smart. Instead, it ranges from mildly annoying to knuckle-gnawing infuriating. But since our show, like Popular Mechanics magazine, is about problem solving, we've included the MythBusters fix for some of this misguided machinery.\n\nCordless tools and equipment--all with different kinds of battery packs and chargers.\n\nIn the MythBusters' workshop I have about 20 chargers and too many battery packs to count that still work but are totally useless. Why not design cordless tools with power packs in 6-volt modules? If designers need to increase the voltage, it's just a matter of adding another module. Logical, right?\n\nI also want to be able to put one brand of battery in another brand of tool. After all, you don't buy a Chevy battery to start a Chevrolet.\n\nFlashlights and other small electrical devices that run on exotic batteries.\n\nI have a lovely little LED flashlight called the Fenix that puts out 1 watt, uses a single AA battery and lasts for months of use. If you look around, most similar flashlights on the market use lithium or other expensive batteries. The catch? Unless you need a high-intensity beam, they don't work any better or last any longer than mine does. I'd be happier if compact LED flashlights that require $13 batteries had never become so mainstream.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nCellphones that all come with different chargers and power-supply units.\n\nHow many times have you been totally shut down while away from your home or office because you can never find one of these puppies at a local shop? Miraculously, the industry appears to be working on a solution to this problem. The Open Mobile Terminal Platform (omtp.org) is supported by a number of manufacturers that would like to see the micro USB become the standard connector. It's too early to know if they will succeed; let's hope they do.\n\nAV equipment that has different types of hookups and remote-control protocols.\n\nThese things drain too much brainpower and time. For instance, HDMI is considered the standard cable hookup for hi-def equipment, but it isn't fully compatible with other AV protocols, such as DVI, component or, for that matter, coaxial cable.\n\nAs for remote controls, there are standard \"remote codes\" but the system is horrible and unnecessarily confusing. Changing it might lead to a system that doesn't accommodate older remotes. See what I mean? It can make your head spin.\n\nComputer operating systems loaded with stuff I don't want and will never use.\n\nIn the tech world this phenomenon is known as \"software bloat\" or \"feature bloat.\" It's a well-documented problem and a frequent complaint about Windows OSs--Vista in particular. In addition to being buggy, the extra features tend to bog down your system by demanding more processing power and memory. Computer-makers: Don't load up operating systems with features and then make us sweat to figure out how to get rid of the fat.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nMost features can be set up as options. Why not start with a computer loaded with basic stuff that works 100 percent of the time? Then, give us the option of adding the bells and whistles. There's another solution available to consumers: Switch to a Linux-based OS such as Ubuntu. Since most Linux OSs are free, there's no business reason to bloat up the system with feature frills.\n\nAnd high-tech companies--stop messing with us on your treadmill of upgrades while making the old stuff obsolete.

      "The copyright trolls of Prenda Law have kicked back against a judge who ordered them to appear before a Los Angeles court this coming Monday. The hearing has the potential to lead to prison for some of those involved but not if Prenda have their way. In a letter sent to the court, Prenda argues several points for canceling the hearing including that the judge lacks jurisdiction, they haven't been given enough notice, and arrangements haven't been made for them to get paid. The hole is getting bigger but they keep on digging.\n\nAs reported yesterday the copyright trolls of Prenda Law been attempting to bully the owners and users of anti-troll sites FightCopyrightTrolls (FCT) and DieTrollDie (DTD).\n\nThey ordered WordPress to hand over the IP addresses of everyone who has used both sites for the last two years. But, after a little panic, WordPress stepped in to calm the nerves.\n\n\"No cause for concern. As a matter of policy, we closely review all subpoenas, don't respond to overly broad requests, and push back on fishing expeditions,\" WordPress's Paul Sieminski told DTD.\n\n\"Here – dietrolldie has already let us know that the subpoena will be challenged. In cases like this, we don't turn over any information until the user's legal challenge has played out.\"\n\nWhat is becoming apparent is that for every heavy-handed and/or suspect action taken by Prenda, even more adversaries come on board. Lawyer John Whitaker from the Whitaker Law Group deliberately 'outed' himself as a DTD and FCT user yesterday, and BitTorrent defense lawyer Robert Cashman is more critical than ever before.\n\nAs yesterday's article outlined, Monday will see Prenda hauled before a Los Angeles court on the orders of Judge Wright after he appeared to become somewhat tired of the firm's apparent shenanigans.\n\nWell, that was the plan. Unsurprisingly, Prenda have other ideas.\n\nIn an ex parte application for relief filed by John Steele, Paul Hansmeier, Paul Duffy and Angela Van Den Hemel, Prenda argue that they shouldn't have to come to court on Monday. In their application, Prenda roll out a variety of excuses for not attending.\n\nFirst, in a move that's likely to further inflame an already irritated Judge Wright, Prenda claim that the Judge has no jurisdiction.\n\n\"Even where the court seeks to adjudicate issues between parties, it must have personal jurisdiction over them. Here, Steele, Hansmeier, Duffy, and Van Den Hemel are not parties and have not otherwise participated in this litigation. As such, the public policy behind the need to determine personal jurisdiction is arguably at an elevated level because, as individuals, they effectively have 'no dog in this fight',\" the application reads.\n\nPrenda go on to argue that since they're not parties in the action they can only be witnesses. And since witnesses can only be required to appear if they are \"resident within the state at the time of service\" (and Prenda aren't, apparently), then \"the court lacks jurisdiction to order them to appear.\"\n\nSecond, Prenda say that attending would be particularly inconvenient. They write that the court is being \"fundamentally unreasonable\" in giving short notice and that attending court could upset their clients.\n\nPrenda go on to argue that they haven't been told why they have to attend so cannot adequately prepare, a situation which deprives them of due process. They also complain that they are entitled to get paid for attending but the court order makes no mention of who will foot the bill.\n\n\"For these reasons, even if the court had jurisdiction over the parties, the notice would be unreasonable to them and the court would, at a minimum, have to withdraw the order and issue a new one for a future date that would afford Steele, Hansmeier, Duffy, and Van Den Hemel reasonable notice of the hearing, their rights, and the purpose for their appearance,\" Prenda conclude.\n\nKen, a writer over at the respected legal blog Popehat, is not impressed.\n\n\"Considering they have had several days to put a brief together, I find this motion rather half-hearted and meager, particularly given the gravity of the situation and what they are trying to accomplish. If this is all they could pull together, I am surprised they didn't file it sooner, like Wednesday,\" he writes.\n\nKen adds that the record shows that jurisdiction is not an issue and Prenda are only making matters worse.\n\n\"The evidence clearly shows that Steele, Hansmeier, and Duffy have directed Prenda Law litigation activities in California. A federal judge has ordered them to appear here and explain those activities.\n\n\"By responding with a jurisdictional argument now, they have utterly eviscerated their credibility and the credibility of their enterprise permanently in every court in the United States of America,\" he concludes.",
      "UPDATE: Canada's Muslim Community have responded to the Shafia trial verdict. While many Muslim community leaders have decried the violence and deaths of the four women, the use of the term honour killings to describe the crime has raised concern. \"It's basically created that kind of divide where...now, because of the kind of savagery that's been painted on that, people who possibly would be victimized won't come forward,\" said Muslim community leader Saleha Khan.\n\n---\n\nKINGSTON, Ont. - Three members of an Afghanistan-born Montreal family were defiant Sunday in the face of life in prison and harsh condemnation for the murders of three daughters and a co-wife apparently motivated by what the judge called their \"twisted concept of honour.\"\n\nA jury took 15 hours to find Mohammad Shafia, 58, his wife Tooba Yahya, 42, and their son Hamed, 21, each guilty of four counts of first-degree murder in a so-called mass honour killing that has captivated Canadians from coast to coast, and touched off post-911 criticism of Muslim culture.\n\nThe three immediately pronounced the verdicts as unjust, but the judge was unmoved, cutting right to the core of the cultural cloud that hung over this case.\n\n\"It is difficult to conceive of a more heinous, more despicable, more honourless crime,\" Ontario Superior Court Judge Robert Maranger said.\n\n\"The apparent reason behind these cold-blooded, shameful murders was that the four completely innocent victims offended your completely twisted concept of honour...that has absolutely no place in any civilized society.\"\n\nThe trial heard evidence over many weeks about the bizarre divide in the Shafia family, in which the patriarch struck fear in the hearts of some of his children, though often being away on business Hamed acted as the surrogate disciplinarian. The three murdered daughters thumbed their noses at the family rules. The children they did not kill were the ones ratting out their sisters to their parents for bad behaviour, court heard.\n\nIt was notions of honour, directly tied to women's sexuality and general control over their behaviour, that led the Shafias to kill, court heard, in an effort to cleanse them of the shame they perceived their daughters to have brought upon them.\n\nThe concept is in stark contrast to Canadian values, the Crown said. The idea that such thinking had not only been brewing in one of Canada's most cosmopolitan cities, but that this \"honour\" apparently superseded the value of life for the Shafias has shocked many.\n\nBut investigators who pored over the details of the disturbing inner workings of the Shafia family and examined the tiniest pieces of evidence from the crime scene urged people Sunday to remember the victims.\n\nAll that sisters Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13, and Rona Amir Mohammad, 52, their father's childless first wife in a polygamous marriage wanted was freedom, and it cost them their lives, court heard.\n\nTheir bodies were found June 30, 2009, in a car submerged in a canal in Kingston, Ont., in a multiple murder the Crown asserted was committed to restore family honour, lost when the girls began dating and acting out. Rona was simply disposed of, the Crown said.\n\nThe jury's verdict indicates the seven women and five men believe Shafia, Yahya and Hamed plotted to kill their troublesome family members, dumping their bodies in a canal and staging it — albeit clumsily — to look like an accident.\n\nThe three now-convicted multiple murderers did not accept their fates quietly.\n\n\"We are not criminal, we are not murderer, we didn't commit the murder and this is unjust,\" Shafia said through an interpreter when the judge asked if he had anything to say.\n\nYahya, who spent a withering six days on the stand testifying in her own defence, was similarly assertive.\n\n\"Your honourable justice, this is not just,\" she said, also through an interpreter. \"I am not a murderer, and I am a mother — a mother!\"\n\nHamed said in English: \"Sir, I did not drown my sisters anywhere.\"\n\nDuring the three-month trial Hamed was the only one of the three never to betray any emotion, but as it became clear he could face life in prison, the young man put his head in his hands and hunched over in the prisoners' box while his parents rubbed his back. Yahya soon began to cry.\n\nFirst-degree murder carries an automatic life sentence with no chance to apply for parole for 25 years. The family has been behind bars since their arrests on July 22, 2009.\n\nOutside court, Crown attorney Gerard Laarhuis said the verdict is a reflection of Canadian values that he hopes will resonate.\n\n\"This jury found that four strong, vivacious and freedom-loving women",

      "Jackie Chan Retiring from Big Action Movies, But Has One Last Trailer\n\nThe end of an era? It can't be! For as long as I can remember, Jackie Chan has been an action star. One of my first R-rated action experiences was his old film Rumble in the Bronx, still one of my favorites. Chan recently appeared at the Cannes Film Festival to do some promotion for his new film, and apparently revealed he's retiring from action movies - or maybe just \"big action movies\", but we're not entirely sure. The first set of quotes comes from The Telegraph, who has Jackie Chan saying: \"This is my last action film. I tell you, I'm not young any more. I'm really, really tired. And the world is too violent right now.\"\n\nTelegraph goes on to quote Jackie Chan further from his press event, talking about his work on the $37 million film Chinese Zodiac, saying: \"For the last 10 years I have been making some other different movies. I want to be an Asian Robert De Niro. I don't just want to be an action star, I want to be a true actor. I want to get rid of my image.\" One of his recent stronger films was Shinjuku Incident, which I caught in theaters, and he was very good in it. He adds, \"I want the audience to know I'm not only a comedian. I can act. Day by day, year by year, I'm going to show you the real Jackie Chan.\" Chinese Zodiac is Chan's 100th film, which means it's (unfortunately) the perfect time in his career to announce news this drastic.\n\nBut he's not retiring from action. And in fact, there's a new trailer for Chinese Zodiac (see it below) that includes some slightly different quotes from Chan. They have him saying: \"I've been fighting and doing action films all my life, you've got to find a point to stop. With this movie I'm the director, I'm the writer, I'm the producer. So okay, I think it's a good time to announce that it's my last big action movie.\" Adding that, \"I would still do action movies but not a big one like this.\" They don't have a source on their quotes, but it makes me wonder which of these are the real truth - will he still do smaller action films? I hope so.\n\nHere is the first official trailer for Chinese Zodiac via YouTube, Jackie Chan's last \"big action movie\":\n\nChinese Zodiac, a big Chinese production currently filming, is being directed by Jackie Chan. The project was first announced years ago and is rumored to have a major fight scene that cost 70 million yuan, or more than $10M, to shoot. The plot involves a man searching the world for a set of mystic artifacts - 12 bronze heads of the animals from the Chinese zodiac. Sounds like fun, but if this is all true, it will indeed be Chan's last \"big action\" movie and the end of an era. Better hope this turns out awesome, then again there's another 99 films in his filmography that have already made him a legend. Chinese Zodiac looks good, but if this is true, I'm going to have to go on a Jackie Chan action classic binge when I return from this fest.

      "Tax-weighted democracy\n\nIn a pure democracy each individual has one vote, but pure democracy is not a good form of government. Pure democracy killed Socrates in Athens, pure democracy is you and two drunken bums in a street corner deciding by a majority vote on the allocation of the contents in your wallet, pure democracy is the dictatorship of the proletariat also known as communism, pure democracy is a majority of whites deciding that blacks should be slaves, and pure democracy is a majority of christians deciding that heretics should be burned.\n\nThanks to the wisdom of the founding fathers, the United States is far from a pure democracy despite what George Bush may say, what we actually have is a constitutional republic where the government is very limited in the things that it can do. We only use democracy to decide on the things that the government is not forbidden from doing. So a christian majority could not impose a national religion, and a KKK majority could not just vote to have slavery restored. In those cases and many like them there is no democracy, and that is very good.\n\nWhere things went wrong, is that while the government is forbidden from imposing a religion or from instituting slavery, it is not forbidden from \"redistributing\" wealth through taxation. This results in the situation where two bums and yourself are voting to allocate the ownership of the contents of your wallet. Those who don't have any money and don't care to work to get it will always vote to simply take it from those who work and \"redistribute\" it to themselves. In any other context that is considered stealing.\n\nThe solution I propose to this problem is to have the vote of a person be weighted by the total amount of taxes that person pays. That way, those who don't pay any taxes would not have the power to steal from those who do. People who really care about voting would overpay their taxes in order to have their vote count for more. If taxes became too high, those who pay the most of them would have the power to lower them. Interest groups could raise money to pay more taxes so they could vote more in an issue that they cared about. Lobbyists would stop bribing politicians and start paying more taxes instead, in order to buy influence. The final result would be that most taxes would be collected from voluntary donations, and very few if any would have to be mandatory.\n\nThis would still be a democracy, but without the unfair \"redistribution\" of wealth from those who work to those who vote. This is what I call a tax-weighted democracy. A corporation works similarly, each stockholder votes proportionally to how many stocks of the corporation they bought. A tax-weighted democracy would be more like a membership, people vote according to how much they pay in dues.\n\nThe only modification that I would make to the tax-weighted democracy would be weighting the vote of veterans higher than those of other people. Serving in the military and risking one's life to defend our country is a very steep form of tax payment which is not adequately compensated by the salary received, so this would be consistent with a tax-weighted democracy.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nLike this: Like Loading...

      "Scottish ministers were warned by their own economic advisers that plans for an oil fund under independence may require tax rises or spending cuts.\n\nThe advice, written for the government last year and published under freedom of information laws, has been seen by the BBC and the Daily Mail newspaper.\n\nPro-Union campaigners claimed the pubic was being deceived.\n\nBut the Scottish government said the private advice had since been overtaken by events.\n\nIt warned that, if Scotland became independent, it would have to raise taxes, cut services or borrow to create the oil fund.\n\nBut it also said Scotland could have paid off its debts 30 years ago if it had been independent and had had oil revenues.\n\nThe advice calculated the tax surpluses of the 1980s could have been set aside to create a Norwegian-style oil fund which would have been worth £117bn by 2011.\n\nThe emergence of the paper led to stormy exchanges during first minister's questions at the Scottish Parliament, where Labour and the Conservatives accused the SNP government of trying to hide information detrimental to its case for independence, ahead of the referendum on 18 September next year.\n\nLabour leader Johann Lamont asked the first minister: \"When was he going to tell us his choice to raise taxes or cut public spending? The answer is, never. Honesty is not something this government deals in.\"\n\nAnalysis You could see the frustration evident in Johann Lamont's demeanour. What she wanted to do was to leap to her feet and yell, in the general direction of the first minister: \"Liar! Liar! Pants on fire!\" But Parliamentary rules preclude such language. So, instead of suggesting that Alex Salmond was sporting flammable trews, she noted en passant that honesty was an alien concept for his administration. Oiling the referendum wheels\n\nWhen Ms Lamont was asked to withdraw the remark by Holyrood's presiding officer, she continued: \"I accept the advice of the presiding offer, but I have to say I do not know what word you use to describe a government that says one thing in private and something different in public.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, Scotland is on pause and we will not be given the full facts with this government ahead of a referendum.\"\n\nBut Mr Salmond said the contents of the private advice had come before recommendations published last week by the Scottish government's fiscal commission working group set out a scenario where, under independence, money could be put into two separate oil funds without spending and taxation changes.\n\nOne fund would help stabilise finances as revenue fluctuates, while the other would be a long term investment fund, similar to the one operated by Norway.\n\nThe first minister said: \"We've got a fiscal commission report which sets out clear criteria, how we can marshal Scotland's resources and make sure that asset is used for the benefit of this generation and for future generations.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Alistair Darling: \"If you were to set up an oil fund you would have to borrow money to save it so that seems to be complete nonsense.\"\n\n\"Nobody would seriously argue that the UK has handled oil well as a resource over the last 40 years. Nobody would seriously dispute that Norway - the country across the North Sea - has handled that resource much better.\"\n\n\"The fiscal commission have put forward a proposal which allows Scotland to get towards the fortunate position of Norway, as opposed to making the unremitting bungles of Westminster and successive United Kingdom chancellors.\"\n\nWhen the government reached any section in that said that an oil fund would mean higher taxes, more borrowing or lower public spending, they hit delete Ruth Davidson, Scottish Conservative leader\n\nHowever, Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she ran both the private advice and the fiscal commission report through \"university cheating software\".\n\nShe went on: \"And what did I find? Whole sections cut and pasted - entire paragraphs on Scotland's projected net fiscal debt, on the country's debt interest payments and on notional borrowing costs.\n\n\"All the good stuff made the grade. All the bad stuff hit the bin.\n\nMs Davidson added: \"It seems when the government reached any section in here - and there were plenty - that said that an oil fund would mean higher taxes, more borrowing or lower public spending, they simply hit delete.\"\n\nEarlier, on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Alistair Darling, who is former chancellor and head of pro-Union Better Together, said: \"If you were to set up an oil fund you would have to borrow money to save it so that seems to be complete nonsense.\n\n\"The problem we have here is yet again we are being told one thing in public when the SNP knows something else is the case in private.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John Swinney: \"If debt is reducing..... then it is prudent and",

      "Antilia is a private home in South Mumbai, India. It is owned by Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries and has a staff of 600 to maintain the residence 24 hours a day.[2][3][4][5]\n\nAs of November 2014 , it is deemed to be the world's most expensive residential property, after Buckingham Palace, which is designated as a crown property. It is thus the world's most expensive private residential property,[6] valued over $1 billion. Its controversial design and ostentatious use by a single family has made it infamous across the world, with severe criticism in the architectural press and mockery in popular media.[7]\n\nIt is located on Altamount Road, Cumballa Hill in Mumbai.\n\nNaming [ edit ]\n\nThe building is named after the mythic island Antillia (with two Ls).[8]\n\nConstruction [ edit ]\n\nAntilia as seen from Altamount Road\n\nAntilia was built in consultation with US architecture firms Perkins and Will & Hirsch Bedner Associates (though neither firm lists it as a Notable Project), with the Australian-based construction company Leighton Holdings initially taking charge of its construction.[9] The home has 27 floors with extra-high ceilings. (Other buildings of equivalent height may have as many as 60 floors.).[10] The home was also designed to survive an earthquake rated 8 on the Richter scale.[11] It is considered by some to be the tallest single-family house in the world. Because it includes space for a staff of 600, others reserve that honour for a house meant to be occupied only by a single family.[12]\n\nControversies [ edit ]\n\nIn 2005, this property was purchased by Mukesh Ambani-controlled entity, Muffin-Antilia Commercial Private Limited from the Currimbhoy Ebrahim Khoja Trust, in direct contravention[13] of § 51 of the Wakf Act.[14]\n\nThe 4532sqm[15] plot of land had been previously owned by the Currimbhoy Ebrahim Khoja Yateemkhana (an orphanage). This charitable institution had sold the land allocated for the purpose of education of underprivileged Khoja children to Antilia Commercial Private Limited in July 2002 for ₹210.5 million (US$2.9 million).[16] The prevailing market value of the land at the time was at least ₹1.5 billion (US$21 million).[17][18][19]\n\nThe Waqf minister Nawab Malik opposed this land sale, as did the revenue department of the Government of Maharashtra. Thus a stay order was issued on the sale of the land. The Waqf board also initially opposed the deal and filed a PIL in the Supreme Court challenging the decision of the trust. The Supreme Court, while dismissing the petition, asked the Waqf board to approach the Bombay High Court. However, the stay on the deal was subsequently vacated after the Waqf board withdrew its objection on receiving an amount of ₹1.6 million (US$22,000) from Antilia Commercial Pvt Ltd, and it issued a No Objection Certificate.[20]\n\nIn 2007 the Allahabad government said the structure is illegal because the land's owner, the Waqf Board, had no right to sell it, as Waqf property can neither be sold nor transferred.[5] Ambani then obtained a No Objection Certificate from the Waqf Board after paying ₹1.6 million and began construction.[5] In June 2011, the Union government asked the Maharashtra government to consider referring the matter to the Central Bureau of Investigation.[21][22][23][24]\n\nIn regards to the three helipads, the Indian Navy said it will not allow the construction of helipads on Mumbai buildings, while the Environment Ministry, following a representation from Awaaz Foundation,[25] said the helipads violate local noise laws.[5][26] Issues have also been raised with regards to the construction of an illegal car park.\n\nIn 2011 it was reported that Ambani had yet to move into the home, despite its completion, for fear of \"bad luck\".[27]Basannt R. Rasiwasia, an expert in Vastu shastra, claims the home does not conform to Vastu requirements.[28]\n\nCost and valuation [ edit ]\n\nAntilia is the world's most expensive home, costing approximately US $2 billion.[29][30][31] Thomas Johnson, director of marketing at architecture firm Hirsch Bedner Associates (consulted by Reliance during the design of the building's floor plan) told Forbes magazine the residence cost nearly $2 billion.[32]\n\nPublic reception [ edit ]\n\nIt's a stupendous show of wealth, it's kind",

Yes, that is a scientific term.\n\nWhether the bullets can pierce body armor, in the judge's words, is irrelevant. If that was the standard then anytime a pistol was made to chamber a high-powered hunting cartridge, that ammunition would have to be banned.\n\nWhether or not ammunition is classified as \"armor piercing\" is determined by a specific section of US firearms law (18 U.S.C., § 921(A)(17))\n\nHere is the relevant statute:\n\n(B) The term \"armor piercing ammunition\" means- (i) A projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or (ii) A full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.\n\nThose are the two ways that the law allows the Federal government to designate a bullet as \"armor piercing.\" By the law's own definition, 5.45×39 ammunition CANNOT be classified as armor piercing.\n\nAs you can see in (B)(i), there are two parts of this that must be met for ammo to be classified as \"armor piercing.\" Ammunition must have a \"projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun…\"\n\nBefore we even move on to the rest of the sentence, it is important to note that even a year+ after the ammunition was banned, there is still not a commercially available 5.45×39 pistol on the American market. The ATF used an obscure company's request to import AK74 pistols – which never actually got imported – as the excuse to ban the ammunition. If the ammunition can be used in a handgun, the ATF needs to produce evidence of a commercially available AK-74 handgun here in the US, not evidence that there is a handgun made to fire the bullet somewhere in the world.\n\nBut the second part is equally damaging to the government's case.\n\n\"…and [a projectile or projectile core] which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium.\"\n\nTake a look at a the design of the 5.45×39's bullet.\n\nThe only way that this ammunition could possibly meet (B)(i)'s definition of \"armor piercing\" would be if the portion of lead alloy (shown in the diagram above) was classified as merely being a \"trace element.\" It clearly is not. One photo making the rounds on the internet shows very clearly that lead is present within the projectile or projectile core in a quantity greater than simply being a \"trace element.\"\n\nThat is what it looks like when the lead from a 5.45×39 surplus bullet is melted down. Trace elements, by definition, should not be visible to the naked eye at any time nor should they be of this quantity.\n\nSo with regard to the (B)(i) definition of armor piercing, not only has the ATF failed to acknowledge that 5.45 commercially available pistols don't exist, but the ammunition also fails to meet the definition because the projectile and projectile core are not made up entirely of steel or some other prohibited metal.\n\nSo let's move on to (B)(ii)…\n\nA full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.\n\nIf we want to deal with specifics, the 5.45×39 surplus 7N6 bullet is not fully jacketed. Anyone who has pulled a bullet, or simply looked at the diagram above, can see that the jacket ends at the bottom of the projectile, exposing both lead and steel.\n\nSecondly, the 5.45×39 round was both designed and intended for use in Soviet Union assault rifles, never for pistols. So it obviously cannot meet that part of the definition.\n\nAnd finally, the law explicitly says that an armor piercing bullet must be a \"full jacketed",

In fact, it will provide just three.\n\nStart screen. The Windows Phone 7.8 Starts screen will be changed to look like that of Windows Phone 8. It will fill the entry screen with tiles, and not leave a strange \"white space\" gutter on the right side, as does Windows Phone 7.x. (This was apparently the source of some great number of user complaints, the theme being that Windows Phone doesn't completely take advantage of its onscreen real estate. Commoners.)\n\nTile customization. Windows Phone 7.8 will now support three tile sizes, just like Windows Phone 8, and not two like the current version. And apps can be written to support any of the three sizes, giving the user the ability to choose between them (as is done with Windows 8's live tiles). In addition to the current Small (square) and Large (rectangular) sizes, Windows Phone 7.8 and 8 will also support a new Smaller size, which is a fingertip-sized square that is one-fourth the size of a small Tile. Mix and match as you please.\n\nWindows Update. Windows Phone 7.8 will be delivered directly to all Windows Phone users, bypassing the carriers. You will be able to download and install Windows Phone 7.8 over Wi-Fi, at home or wherever else, and install this update. This type of updating will be made available in Windows Phone 8, as well, as given my long, loud, and lengthy complaining about the lack of such updating in Windows Phone 7.x, you won't be surprised, maybe, to discover that Microsoft jokingly calls this \"the Paul Thurrott feature\" internally.\n\nNice.\n\nWant to learn more about Windows Phone 8?

      "Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian-American activist who has expressed support for terrorists, recently called on Muslims to wage a form of \"jihad\" against the Trump administration.\n\nSpeaking at the 54th annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) last week, Sarsour said that she was not advocating for a violent form of jihad.\n\n\"A word of truth in front of a tyrant ruler or leader, that is the best form of jihad,\" she said, quoting the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\n\"I hope, that when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad, that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers not only abroad in the Middle East or the other side of the world, but here in these United States of America where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reining in the White House,\" said Sarsour, who was named a \"Champion of Change\" by the Obama administration in 2012.\n\nThe activist, who helped organize the Women's March, spent much of her 22-minute speech attacking Trump.\n\n\"When I wake up every morning and remember who is sitting in the White House, I am outraged,\" she said at one point.\n\nAt the beginning of her speech, Sarsour thanked Siraj Wahaaj, a Brooklyn-based cleric who was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the first World Trade Center bombing.\n\nISNA, the group hosting Sarsour, was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation terror financing case. The Holy Land Foundation helped funnel money to the terror group Hamas.\n\nSarsour recently met a former Hamas operative named Salah Sarsour. It is unclear if the two are related, though The Daily Caller reported in January that the pair posed for a photograph on the sidelines of a convention held in Chicago in December.\n\nShe has also rallied on behalf of Rasmea Odeh, a Palestinian woman who was convicted of killing two Israelis in a 1969 bomb attack. (RELATED: Women's March Organizer Rallies For Convicted Terrorist)\n\nOdeh was recently deported from the U.S. for immigration violations.\n\nSarsour has also come under fire for some of her past comments about other female activists. In 2011, she posted a tweet saying that activists Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Brigitte Gabriel, both critics of Islam, should not be allowed to have vaginas. (RELATED: Linda Sarsour Recently Met Ex-Hamas Operative)\n\n\"Brigitte Gabriel = Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She's asking 4 an a$$ whippin'. I wish I could take their vaginas away- they don't deserve to be women,\" she wrote at the time. (RELATED: Linda Sarsour Dismisses Female Genital Mutilation Question)\n\nSarsour has also used her high profile to raise money for questionable causes.\n\nLast month, Sarsour helped raise more than $100,000 for a Somali woman she claimed was the victim of a hate crime attack in Cincinnati.\n\nBut as The Daily Caller reported at the time, the circumstances of the attack are vague, and police determined that the incident was not a hate crime. The alleged victim was injured in a large brawl that stemmed from a neighborhood dispute. A woman whose boyfriend was accused of the hate crime said that she was threatened, assaulted and tasered by a friend of the alleged hate crime victim.\n\nIn her ISNA speech, Sarsour suggested that Muslims in America should by wary of assimilation if it comes at the price of sacrificing their identity.\n\n\"Our number one and top priority is to protect and defend our community. It is not to assimilate and to please any other people in authority. And our top priority…is to please Allah, and only Allah,\" she said.\n\nWATCH:\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter",

      "Two-thirds of the world's 758 million illiterate people are women. Project Literacy, a global movement campaigning for advances in literacy levels worldwide, has compiled a body of research called the Alphabet of Illiteracy which demonstrates how illiteracy underpins almost every major problem humanity faces, from A-Z. Many of these issues relate directly to women: C is for Child Brides, F is for FGM, G is for Gender Inequality, X is for X-Rated. These are all themes that were explored in Half the Sky: How to Change the World by Nick Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn.\n\nCoinciding with International Literacy Day, Emma Watson's book club, Our Shared Shelf, is currently reading Half The Sky. Here she poses her questions to the authors.\n\nEmma Watson: Since its publication seven years ago, there has been tremendous headway in the fight for women's rights, though there is still much work to be done. What new challenges have surfaced since you wrote the book? Which threat has evolved the most since the book's publication?\n\nNick Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn: First, Emma, thanks so much for recommending Half the Sky and for your work on these issues. We really do feel the progress, and that's partly because so many more people are aware of abuses now than a decade ago.\n\nIf we were rewriting Half the Sky, we might say more about challenges in the West. We focused on the developing world because that's where the challenges are greatest, but we truly do face enormous gender inequities in America and Europe as well. Activists tend to focus on issues like equal pay or equal representation on boards, and those are real, but two of the most important neglected issues are domestic violence and human trafficking. In the U.S. alone, three women are murdered each day by their boyfriends or husbands, while some 10,000 girls under 18 are trafficked each year into the sex trade. So we definitely want to see a continued focus on global issues, but we also don't have the credibility to tell other countries to clean up their act unless we do more at home.\n\nEW: According to EqualityNow.org, sexual exploitation and the trafficking of women and children is the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world, despite laws in 134 countries criminalizing it. Why do you think it continues to rise so relentlessly, and what do you think is the single most effective solution for fighting it? Is there one?\n\nNK & SW: We'd be wary of saying that sex trafficking is increasing globally, because we just don't have good enough data to have a clear sense of trends. But trafficking is certainly widespread, and that's partly because society looks down on the victims and because they are usually the most voiceless of people: poor, female and powerless. There is also the myth that this is a victimless crime, that women who sell sex are doing so willingly. Yes, some do, but millions do not, and a woman in a brothel may smile because if she doesn't meet her quota for the day she'll be beaten. There is no silver bullet to fight sex trafficking, but one experiment in Cebu, the Philippines, suggests that training police and targeting the problem of trafficking children really does reduce the number of kids being raped in brothels each day. Likewise, in places like America, it makes sense to go after the pimps and traffickers rather than prosecute the women and girls -- who in fact are typically the victims. Finally, we're sympathetic to the Swedish model, which prosecutes the customers and thus aims to reduce the demand for commercial sex that drives human trafficking.\n\nEW: At the end of Half the Sky, you offer four steps that everyone can take to make big changes. Are there other effective and simple steps that every person -- of any age and in any location -- can take to help economically empower women around the world?\n\nNK & SW: On the economic empowerment side, the evidence increasingly suggests that microloans are somewhat less effective than people had hoped, but that microsavings somewhat more effective (the example we give in Half the Sky of Goretti in Burundi is of microsavings, i.e. helping her save small sums and invest them in small businesses). So there has been a big push by many aid groups for community savings and loan associations that support women; CARE has been a leader in this, but many groups do it. We're also seeing more evidence of the transformative effects of programs targeting young children. If one deworms kids through groups like Deworm the World, they will grow up to be healthier and earn more money and support their families better. Educating girls always has transformative effects not just on them but also on their communities. And providing family planning for the 200 million women around the world who don't want to get pregnant but don't have access to birth control should be a no-brainer!\n\nOne of our frustrations",

(Photo: Air Force)\n\nThe Air Force is waiting for Congress to sort out the fiscal 2015 budget before deciding what kind of force management programs it will need this year.\n\nDue to budget cuts, the Air Force is being forced to trim its ranks, from about 330,700 airmen as of the beginning of 2014 to about 310,900. So far, the Air Force has already cut, or selected to cut, 16,624 airmen under voluntary and involuntary force management programs, according to statistics provided by the service.\n\nIn a Nov. 4 interview at the Pentagon, Lt. Gen. Sam Cox, deputy chief of staff for manpower, personnel and services, said that the Air Force can't move forward on the 2015 cuts until the budget is resolved. The military is currently operating under a continuing resolution, which temporarily funds the federal government at 2014 levels.\n\nBut that CR expires Dec. 11, and it remains unclear what will happen then. Defense Comptroller Mike McCord said at an Oct. 30 conference that he is \"not super optimistic\" about Congress' chances of striking a budget deal during the lame duck period after the midterm elections.\n\n\"We're still waiting on some decisions in terms of what's the budget going to look like,\" Cox said, when asked about 2015 force management programs. \"Are we still going to be under a CR? Or, what it's going to be. So until that's determined, we don't have a final answer.\"\n\nAnd if Congress decides to cut the Air Force's budget down to the Budget Control Act's sequestration spending levels, Cox said the Air Force will have to completely rethink its end strength numbers.\n\n\"If we get BCA level [funding], the end strength is significantly lower than what we've got programmed right now,\" Cox said. \"So that really depends. A BCA level is different than a continuing resolution level, is different than a president's budget level. Until we know what our end strength is, issued by Congress, we can't make a decision at this point.\"\n\nCox would not say what kind of force management programs might be required under a CR versus what Budget Control Act-level spending would require.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1u4QIm8",

The death throes of this star may only last mere moments on a cosmological timescale, but this star's demise is still quite lengthy by our standards, lasting tens of thousands of years!\n\nThe star's agony has culminated in a wonderful planetary nebula known as NGC 6565, a cloud of gas that was ejected from the star after strong stellar winds pushed the star's outer layers away into space. Once enough material was ejected, the star's luminous core was exposed, enabling its ultraviolet radiation to excite the surrounding gas to varying degrees and causing it to radiate in an attractive array of colors. These same colors can be seen in the famous and impressive Ring Nebula (heic1310), a prominent example of a nebula like this one.\n\nPlanetary nebulae are illuminated for around 10,000 years before the central star begins to cool and shrink to become a white dwarf.

      "File: Graduates of Bowie State University in College Park, Maryland. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIt's been true for a long time now that academia — or at least the part of it that teaches students — relies heavily on the labor of adjunct faculty. As the number of tenured professors has fallen, universities have filled more than half of their schedules with teachers who work on contract. And no wonder: They'll work for less than half what a full-time professor makes, at a median wage of just $2,700 per course, with scant benefits, if any.\n\nNow, a union that's been rapidly organizing adjuncts around the country thinks that number should quintuple. Last night, on a conference call with organizers across the country, the SEIU decided to extend the franchise with a similar aspirational benchmark: A \"new minimum compensation standard\" of $15,000. Per course. Including benefits.\n\nSince getting into the game a few years ago, the Service Employees International Union has won elections covering about 24,000 contingent faculty across 25 campuses. That's fitting, considering that the union specializes in organizing low-wage sectors, like property maintenance and home health care — as well as fast-food workers, where it's run a high-profile campaign for a $15 an hour wage.\n\nA minimum wage for adjuncts?\n\nAt the moment, the $15,000 number sounds even more outlandish than $15 did when fast food workers started asking for twice the federal minimum wage. But organizers argue that if you're teaching a full load of three courses per semester, that comes out to $90,000 in total compensation per year — just the kind of upper-middle-class salary they think people with advanced degrees should be able to expect. (Most adjuncts teach part-time, which would put them at $50,000 or $75,000 per year.)\n\n\"It's not a path to competitiveness to pay knowledge workers bottom-level wages,\" says Gary Rhoades, head of the Department of Educational and Policy Studies at the University of Arizona, who has assisted in various adjunct organizing efforts, including the SEIU's. \"The question of what they should be paid is taking away from the fact that they are paid way too little, and here's a target we're going to go for.\"\n\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Education, Chart by the American Association of University Professors.\n\nSo what does the idea of a \"national campaign\" really amount to, in substance? SEIU says the $15,000 number isn't necessarily a firm target in contract negotiations at the schools where it represents adjuncts. That's a huge bump, and it's highly unlikely any university would grant it any time soon.\n\nRather, it'll be more of a \"rallying cry\" for organizing and bargaining campaigns. The union will provide people with budget analysis tools to make the case on their own campuses, building up to a national action of some sort on April 15 (which is separate from a national walkout scheduled for Feb. 25).\n\nThe national push on adjunct pay\n\nAlthough the SEIU only has signed contracts at a handful of campuses, the early returns are positive. At Tufts, for example, adjuncts recently won a salary schedule that will build up to a minimum of $7,300 per course in 2016, plus benefits. In Washington, D.C., with contracts at three universities and negotiations underway at two more, the union is closest to being able to win a city-wide contract that would cover teachers equally as they float between campuses.\n\nOf course, SEIU isn't the only union that represents part-time faculty. The National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers, and American Association of University Professors have folded adjuncts into their locals on many campuses — the AFT alone has 80,000 contingent faculty members, and says it will be participating in a National Adjunct Awareness Week later this month..\n\nBut the professorial unions have struggled with the perception that part-timers are a threat to full time jobs. That sometimes prompts adjuncts to go an independent route with the SEIU, which isn't coordinating with the other higher education unions in its push for a $15,000-per-course standard.\n\n\"When I started, there was a sense among some tenured faculty that contingent faculty were not our friends,\" says Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at the City University of New York, remembering her time organizing at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. \"On both sides there was a mistrust. So there's definitely been a tension.\"\n\nStill, all of them agree that adjunct faculty wages need to increase — in part because it might lessen the incentive for universities to replace full-time faculty with contractors. And adjunct advocates point to a steep rise in administrator salaries and multi-million dollar construction projects as evidence that it's",

      "As a columnist, I haven't traditionally offered much in the way of endorsements.\n\nThat's because I generally like to cover the actions of politicians -- which I think speak louder than campaign promises.\n\nStill, I know voters are starved for election information. And I get a lot of requests for perspective on races. So this year, I've decided to highlight a sampling of candidates who stand out -- for better and worse.\n\nA few have my clear recommendation (like the first one). But most are just intended to offer my take when I think there are clear distinctions (good and bad).\n\nThis is by no means all-inclusive. In fact, it's rather scatter shot. If I don't have a good read or intel on a race, it makes no sense for me to offer perspective on it. But if I've watched candidates in action, then I will. Also, if there's an ISSUE I think people want more info on, I'll focus on that. (And no, I'm not offering Trump-Clinton thoughts. A) That's not my beat. B) As if anyone has their mind un-made on that topic.)\n\nThere are lots of other resources and perspectives out there. In fact, I'm including some – including advice from some who disagree with me – at the end of this item.\n\nBut let's now get started with some thoughts on the 2016 elections in no particular order ...\n\nOrange County Comptroller: The proven and endorsed veteran. I can't stress how important I think this position is. It is one of the few independently elected auditors in the entire state of Florida – and often a needed check and balance on other local agencies. Martha Haynie has had this position for more than a decade – and has been one of the most trustworthy local officials in town. For that reason, I take her endorsement very seriously. And she has endorsed Phil Diamond – a former Orlando council member who would be a great fit for the job. I watched Phil up close and in person on city council. He was one of the few who was willing to speak up with finances seemed amiss. He has a strong moral compass and a CPA's background to boot – which makes him a natural for this job.\n\nU.S. Senate Democrats: The long shot. This race is simply sorry. Alan Grayson is an incendiary mess with ethical baggage. Patrick Murphy has raised questions about the legitimacy of his resume – and has cowered from debates. (I really dislike that – no matter what race we're talking about: \"Debate-ducking cowards don't deserve your vote.\" ) For that reason, I think I'm left liking Pam Keith, who was endorsed by the Miami Herald, which called Keith \"accomplished, credible\" and bringing \"one of the freshest perspectives to Florida politics in a long time.\" Read the Herald's full endorsement here.\n\nU.S. House District 10: The trooper. Democrats have put up the strongest field of candidates for Congress in this race that I can ever recall seeing around Orlando. But I'd submit that no candidate has worked harder and longer – and is more under appreciated – than State Sen. Geraldine Thompson. Thompson is smart, hard-working and not afraid of a battle. Opponent Bob Poe, a former party leader, certainly knows how the system works and can credibly claim he wouldn't owe anyone anything, since he's financing his own campaign. And Former Police Chief Val Demings has earned the support of former NY Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group. But Thompson, the former director of Orlando's Wells Built Museum, has worked steadfastly and thanklessly in Tallahassee for a solid decade. Yet for all that, Democratic operatives and moneyed interests in D.C. have basically kicked sand in her face. Thompson deserves better.\n\nU.S. House District 9: \"The True Progressive.\" In the race to succeed Grayson there has been a lot of debate about who's the \"true progressive.\" Really, there's no debate. It's Susannah Randolph, who has been on the front lines of progressive causes for years. Now that may not be what everyone wants. But in this gerrymandered blue district, the candidates seem to be racing to the left – where Randolph has been for years (from working in Grayson's office to running the \"Pink Slip Rick\" [Scott] campaign). Normally, competitor Darren Soto revels in his moderation. In fact, he has touted it as evidence of his ability to work with the other side. (Soto has sided with Republicans on everything from mandatory ultrasounds to the NRA's \"Docs and Glocks\" bill.) If moderation is what Dems want, Soto is their guy. But if it's progressive, that's Randolph. Oh, and as for the candidate with the best-known name (last name anyway ... which she took just in time to seek her new husband's former seat), Dena",
      "This article provides an overview of both the political and the marketing dimensions of clean coal, and the technologies for using coal that have variously been touted as \"clean.\" Each topic is explored in greater depth in separate articles, as are several related topics:\n\nClean Coal Technology - This article assesses progress to date in creating technologies that aimed at eliminating various environmental and health impacts of coal.\n\nClean Coal Marketing Campaign - This article describes the public relations efforts of the coal industry to promote the concept that future coal usage will be safe to the environment and harmless to human health.\n\nClean Coal Subsidies describes federal research and development programs aimed at advancing new coal technologies, as well as subsidies provided to commercial coal operations that meet certain official \"clean\" criteria even though they may continue to generate major pollution streams.\n\nFly Ash, Coal Waste, and Bottom Ash - These articles describe the kinds of secondary waste streams produced by attempts to create \"clean coal.\"\n\nIntroduction\n\nInside USA - America's Real Black Gold\n\nThe term \"clean coal\" is both controversial and complex. Controversy arises out of the coal industry's use of the term in its high-profile marketing campaign aimed at convincing the public and politicians that the goal of using coal without damaging the environment and public health is either a current or a foreseeable reality. Coal opponents assert that such usage is not factually based and that its main purpose is to provide public support and political cover for continued expansion of coal use.\n\nThree factors combine to cause additional complexity in the debate:\n\nA history of shifting terminology: Over time, the meaning of the term \"clean coal\" has repeatedly changed, leading to frequent confusion. A hundred years ago the term appeared in newspapers as a synonym for \"smokeless\" anthracite coal. Today it is frequently used as a shorthand for processes that could allow coal to be used with near-zero greenhouse gas emissions. In the interim it has referred to measures that would reduce various pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and particulates.\n\nGap between old plants, new plants, and next-generation plants: By any measure, the bulk of existing coal plants remain highly polluting. Recently built plants include equipment that reduces most of the sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions, but they continue to emit large amounts mercury and other toxins, and they do not capture any carbon dioxide. The timeframe for commercial implementation of carbon capture and storage is hotly debated, with estimates ranging from 10 to 30 years in the future.\n\nThe \"whack-a-mole\" problem: While the term \"clean coal\" focuses attention on efforts to reduce to coal's atmospheric impacts, measures to tap down the air impacts of coal often cause other environmental impacts of coal to actually worsen. One example of this perverse phenomenon is the large quantity of toxin-laden sludge produced by sulfur scrubbers. Another is the fact that carbon capture and storage, if implemented, will increase mountaintop removal and other surface mining techniques due to the fact that the energy required by such processes will consume approximately 20-25% of a plant's output.\n\nShifting terminology\n\nClick here for an archive of clean coal industry advertisements (1921-2012).\n\nEarly 20th century: \"clean coal\" meant \"smokeless coal\"\n\nPrior to World War II, \"clean coal\" or \"smokeless coal\" was a marketing term used to describe anthracite and high-grade bituminous coal used for cooking and home heating.[1]\n\nLate 20th century: \"clean coal\" meant \"coal with lower regulated emissions\"\n\nWith the arrival of the environmental movement in the late 1960s, the coal industry came under increasing pressure to clean up the myriad of pollutants produced by its mines and plants. Visibility (particulates and nitrous oxides) and acid rain (sulfur dioxide) dominated in the formation of policy established via the 1970 Clean Air Act and subsequent Clean Air Act Amendments in 1977 and 1990, while global warming gases remained unregulated. In response to the new legislation, the coal industry responded with a wide spectrum of technology fixes aimed at lowering \"criteria emissions.\" These included replacement of high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal, scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators, coal cleaning techniques, and development of higher efficiency combustion techniques that allowed more electricity to be generated per ton of emissions. By the 1980s, these technologies came to be referred to under the rubric of \"clean coal technology,\" and the term received official recognition in the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Program (1986-1993).[2]\n\nAfter 2000: \"clean coal\" starts to mean \"zero-emissions coal\"\n\nWith the arrival of the new millenium and the heightened attention to global warming, the previous usage of \"clean coal\" to refer to coal with lower regulated emissions was joined by a futuristic new vision, that of \"zero-emissions\" or \"near-zero-",

      "The question to all theorists from both the theoretically interested and the practically minded alike is this:\n\nGiven the state of wordly affairs is dismal and not what it should be, what am I as an individual to do about it? What should we do?\n\nTo this question every theorist who is honest can only bow their heads in shame and stand in silence. The question, however, I here will give the honest response to:\n\nNo one knows.\n\nWhy this answer? It is clear and obvious from the standpoint of existent reality that no one knows what to do, for if they did they would have already done it. But this state of ignorance on what to do is not the affirmative answer that there can be no knowledge of what to do nor actual practice to get towards what should be. The question, then, is \"What is the nature of the knowledge of what to do to get from the flawed reality to the ideal of what should be?\"\n\nGiven that the materialist dictum of the final determination of consciousness by its existence and its ground in the material reproduction of social life is empirically shown to be false, in that it is the final determinant of consciousness, since the mere material life of humans indeed can be shown to lead nowhere to radically transformative action in-and-of-itself without the guiding light of passionate theory born not of material conditions alone, the question of what is to be done to transform the world into what it should be is seemingly left to unintelligible realms. If there is neither material necessity nor ideal necessity—that knowledge of what should be itself will create movements towards its realization in movement towards what should be—what are we to do?\n\nThe question itself is a genuine one, albeit a confused one. I have written on the impossibility of theorizing revolution prior, and here I want to expand on a further limitation to a universal theory in any practical action. The question truly asks:\n\nWhat can I do to determine other subjects to be grasped by an idea and act towards its realization?\n\nThe first thing to note is that, in this case, an idea must grasp a people. Regardless of the claims of materialism by Marxists, communism itself is an idea as an ideal towards which the masses must strive. Without this idea, the movement of revolutionary upheaval loses its revolutionary character in a positive sense and can only lead to more of the same being reconstituted or possibly even something worse.\n\nTo answer the question posed: the truth is that nobody knows for certain. The fact that people are subjects and thus free is itself the theoretical point at which all practical theory finds its necessary and inevitable break regarding the actions of subjects as such. Even the much simpler and supposedly much easier task of mere reform is inconceivable beyond this point of subjectivity. What indeed are we to do about the freedom of others? What are we to do about their ignorance, their stubbornness, their prejudice, their submersion within ideology?\n\nThe reductive materialists as Accelerationists say we need not do anything, given the theoretical and material fact that the forces of production's developments will of their own change the consciousness of subjects and necessarily cause the transformation of consciousness at the proper point of development. Other kinds of reductive materialists say that the failure of class consciousness of the workers has not arisen because they are a bit too comfortable, i.e. the theory of the labor aristocracy in the first world in comparison to the third. While it is an empirical fact that receptivity to revolutionary ideas is much higher in the so-called developing or third world, it is also an empirical fact that the mere existence and experience of extreme destitution, poverty, and misery does not generate revolutionary ideas nor practice in general, nor does it guarantee receptivity to such ideas.\n\nHow is it possible that given the unbelievable horror of the realities of human exploitation through even pure subjugation by force in many parts of our world, even those in this very subjugation of slavery are themselves unwilling to wage revolution and overthrow their oppressors, let alone the system of their existence? It is not simply because they have no access to the ideas of liberation of the communists. Indeed, one would think that Africa of all places in the world today would be a pressurized gas barrel ready to explode at the tiniest spark of revolutionary theory, and yet this is not the reality. Various theories are fronted as to why the oppressed subject rejects the theoretical standpoint in which its oppression is not only a moral wrong, but demands the action towards the realization of at least their own freedom. Do not the oppressed want and demand freedom? Of course they do! The problem, however, is both a material and spiritual one, but not in the typical Marxist sense of mere forces and relations of production or ideology. It cannot be ignored that we are animals, and as such, we must accept that the basic psychological mechanisms of animals likewise are present in us even with our higher mental capacities—especially when these higher capacities are left",

      "OTTAWA — The Conservative party has pocketed almost $100-million from the taxpayer-funded per-vote subsidy that will be eliminated by next spring — by far the largest financial windfall of any political party.\n\nAs Canada's federal parties build up their war chests for an expected October 2015 election, the subsidy is winding down.\n\nBut all told, the Elections Canada per-vote subsidy will have paid out more than $266-million over 11 years by the time it is phased out on April 1, 2015. The subsidy pays quarterly allowances to the main political parties that obtain at least 2% of all votes in an election, or at least 5% of votes in electoral districts.\n\n[np_storybar title=\"By the numbers\" link=\"\"]\n\n$98.1-M: Total per-vote subsidy to be paid to Conservative party since 2004\n\nTotal per-vote subsidy to be paid to Conservative party since 2004 $75-M: Total per-vote subsidy to be paid to Liberal party since 2004\n\nTotal per-vote subsidy to be paid to Liberal party since 2004 $54.6-M: Total per-vote subsidy to be paid to NDP since 2004\n\nTotal per-vote subsidy to be paid to NDP since 2004 $25.7-M: Total per-vote subsidy to be paid to Bloc Québécois since 2004\n\nTotal per-vote subsidy to be paid to Bloc Québécois since 2004 $12.6-M: Total per-vote subsidy to be paid to Green party since 2004\n\nTotal per-vote subsidy to be paid to Green party since 2004 $266-M: Total that will have been paid out by per-vote subsidy over 11 years once it's eliminated April 1, 2015.\n\n[/np_storybar]\n\nCombined with other election expense reimbursements and tax breaks for political donations, the federal treasury has paid out or forgone more than $600-million over the last decade in what are essentially public subsidies to federal political parties.\n\nThe federal Conservatives will have received more than $98-million when the per-vote subsidy ends next April, while the Liberals have reaped almost $75-million from it over the last 11 years. The NDP received more than $54-million, the Bloc Québécois approximately $25-million and the Green party more than $12-million.\n\nThe per-vote subsidy was launched in 2004 under the former Liberal government to compensate for its decision to eliminate corporate and union donations to federal political parties. Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government passed legislation in 2011 to phase out the political party financing tool. The phase-out started April 1, 2012.\n\nRobert MacDermid, a political scientist at York University in Toronto who specializes in political party financing, said the elimination of the per-vote subsidy will actually benefit the Conservatives more than any other party.\n\nWhile the Tories are receiving the largest subsidy, the party also has shown it has the strongest fundraising machine and is best prepared to solicit donations from its members in the post-subsidy era, he said.\n\n\"The removal of it will maintain the Conservatives' advantage over the other parties,\" Mr. MacDermid said.\n\n\"The Conservatives have been very good at adjusting to these changes. They've gone after various constituencies [of voters], like gun owners.\"\n\nThe per-vote subsidy was valuable for levelling the playing field for political parties, he said, by ensuring parties weren't just financed by wealthier Canadians who can afford to donate more dollars and more often.\n\nThe subsidy paid about $2 per vote to political parties (costing taxpayers $28.7-million) in 2011 when the government announced it was being phased out, and has slowly come down to about 50 cents per vote in its final year of payment.\n\nWhile the subsidy stuffed millions of dollars into political party coffers, Green party Leader Elizabeth May said it has also encouraged turnout at the polls, because electors knew their votes were worth something to the parties they supported.\n\n\"There's a disincentive to vote,\" she said.\n\nFederal parties are also collecting millions of dollars in donations that, because of the federal political tax credit, give Canadians a 75% credit on donations of $400 or less. That means Canadians could donate $400 to a political party, but it would only cost them $100 after receiving the credit.\n\nThe political contribution tax credit has cost the federal treasury more than $250-million over the last decade.\n\nCanada's federal parties have been highlighting the political contribution tax credit in repeated emails to supporters and using it as an incentive to get donations.\n\n\"The Conservatives have sold this reduction of the party subsidy as some great removal of public funding from the system, which is just not true,\" Mr. MacDermid said.\n\nElections Canada also reimburses federal political parties 50%",

      "Facebook Casual Game Demographics\n\nIn a previous posting we looked at the demographic breakdown of all registered facebook accounts in the US. Now I'd like to present some analysis of a subject close to my heart: Casual Games.\n\nBelow is a chart of the demographic profiles of Bejeweled Blitz™ players on facebook (in the US). The vertical axis shows age, with 13 years of age at the top, and 65 and above at the bottom. There is a separate row for each distinct age between these two limits. Female fans are shown on the right with pink bars, and male fans to the left with blue bars.\n\nMALE FEMALE 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65+ (21.74%) (78.26%)\n\nIn the interests of space, subsequent versions of this graph will be shown in thumbnail format, as shown below. The representation is the same – weíve just removed the axis labels and compressed the space between the lines.\n\nEach of the charts in this article have been generated from scraping data from facebook based on the number of people (in the USA in this case), who have affinity in some form with the application (such as being a fan or user of the application). Because of the different denominators and sizes of each keyword population, each graph has been normalized so that the Ďareaí under each curve is the same. In this way, the shapes can be compared to contrast the demographic audience of each keyword. The demographics for Bejeweled Blitz players mirrors the demographics typically seen in the industry for casual download games players, which are typically biased towards the middle-aged female segment. For Bejeweled players on facebook, over 78% are female, with an impressive bulge in the curve between the ages of 25 and 50.\n\nContrast this with players of Call of Duty™, which is adored by teenage boys! Over 92% of the fans of Call of Duty on facebook are male.\n\nMany of the social games we all know, such as Farmville, Yoville and Treasure Isle follow traditional casual gaming profiles. Itís refreshing for our industry to know that, as players migrate away from deluxe download games onto playing on social networks, itís the same demographic audience.\n\n\nAs expected, some games do skew more male biased. Texas Holdíem Poker for instance. Itís not a great shock to find that this application is 67% male biased. Maybe a little more surprising, though not a hugely astonishing is Castle Age, which is 64% male.\n\n\nWhilst Restaurant City skews female with 69%, its audience appears to peak at a younger age. Country Story skews even more female and similarly young, and Happy Pets even more again. This has implications for monetization as, on average, typically a smaller percentage of younger users make payments using microtransactions. Whilst there is a considerable variance, depending on the game, research indicates that the age band that converts the highest percentage of users to paying customers is the 25-35 year old bracket.\n\n\nIt's not just games\n\nWe donít have to limit ourselves to just games and applications; people become fans of other things on facebook. For instance, below are charts showing the demographic curves for fans of Star Wars™ and Twilight™. The curve for Twilight should be no surprise to anyone who shares a house with a teenage daughter. The curve for Star Wars is interesting because of the Ďdouble humpí. There are distinct peaks for fans of the original trilogy (people now in their late 30ís and 40ís), as well as for the younger crowd groomed on prequel episodes and the Clone Wars.\n\n\nBelow are charts for the fans of the Oprah Winfrey Show, and the fans of Ellen Degenerous. At first glance they appear similar at 88-89% female fan base, but if you look closer you can see that Oprahís audience is more mature, peaking in the late 30ís, while Ellen seems to appeal to women in their 20ís.\n\n\nQuiz time\n\nI'll finish this post with a quiz. The graphs below show the demographic curves for three different entities: Barry Manilow, Sex and the City and Howard Stern. Can you work out which is which? Drop me an email if you are having trouble.\n\n\nYou can find a complete list of all the articles here. Click here to receive email alerts on new articles.",

      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes In an important new study, Olivier Blanchard, the Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has just admitted that having respected and accepted the advice of conservative economists has turned out to be a blunder.\n\nThis has cost the world's advanced economies dearly, and must be reversed if the world is to avoid an economic tailspin.\n\nThe basic debate among economists has been over Keynes's \"multiplier\" - the size of the stimulus to the economy that's generated by increasing government spending during flat or declining economic times.\n\nIn other words: this debate is over whether or not adding government spending during a downturn helps an economy turn up again into growth and surpluses, or whether it instead mainly just adds to the government debt that (according to conservative economists) was the result of too much spending, and that (also according to conservative economists) largely caused the existing \"recession.\"\n\nKeynes said that the \"multiplier\" effect of increased government spending is sufficiently large to more-than-counteract the negative economic effect of adding to the government's debt during an economic downturn. Conservative economists assume instead that the multiplier is too small to counteract that negative effect.\n\nThe new \"IMF Working Paper,\" titled \"Growth Forecast Errors and Fiscal Multipliers,\" prepared by Blanchard and Daniel Leigh of their Research Department, reports that whereas the IMF had been accepting conservative economists' estimates that the multiplier was \"about 0.5\" percent growth, the \"actual multipliers were substantially above 1 early in the crisis,\" which was the period when the IMF was recommending and pursuing \"fiscal consolidation,\" which is called in the United States \"austerity.\"\n\nIn other words, the policy recommended by the Republican Party's economists, and which has actually been tried especially in Europe, has failed miserably.\n\nHere are some of the things the IMF study reports:\n\n\"Fiscal multipliers can exceed 3. ... Based on data for 27 economies during the 1930s, ... Alumnia and others (2010) have concluded that fiscal multipliers were about 1.6.\" The IMF report referred to \"our findings that short-term fiscal multipliers have been larger than expected\" during the current crisis, and they wondered whether this underestimation by economists was unusual.\n\n\"How special is the crisis period? ... For the set of two-year intervals during the precrisis decade (1997-2008), we find ... the estimate ... is near zero,\" which was even farther off the empirically demonstrated mark. They wondered why \"fiscal consolidation (or as Americans say, \"austerity\") flops. \"We find that forecasters significantly underestimated the increase in unemployment and the decline in private consumption and investment associated with fiscal consolidation.\"\n\nAccording to Keynesian theory (which got us out of the Great Depression), \"growth disappointments should be larger in economies that planned greater fiscal cutbacks. This is what we found\" in the post-2008 period.\n\nThe report's \"Abstract\" said: \"We find that, in advanced economies, stronger planned fiscal consolidation [the 'austerity' that is being pushed by John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, and other Republicans] has been associated with lower growth than expected. ... Fiscal multipliers were substantially higher than implicitly assumed by forecasters.\"\n\nHere in the U.S., a similar recent study was done by the research arm of the U.S. Congress. That study covered only the U.S. economy, and it focused like a laser on only U.S. economic history. The specific question it examined was whether economic growth has been spurred in the United States by cutting taxes for the rich and introducing austerity for the nation-as-a-whole by the Federal Government, or whether such economic policies have failed to generate economic growth in this country.\n\nIt found that they have failed.\n\nSince the study was American, and the standard version of anti-Keynesianism in this country has been \"supply-side economics,\" which combines austerity with top-end tax-cuts, this study dealt with only the peculiarly American form of conservative anti-Keynesian economic theory. However, its findings were entirely consistent with the recent IMF global findings.\n\nOn 17 September 2012, which was a timely moment during the national debate and congressional negotiations over the \"fiscal cliff,\" thinkprogress.org bannered \"New Study Finds Tax Cuts For The Rich Cause Income Inequality, Not Economic Growth,\" and reported that, \"According to a new report by the Congressional Research Service, cutting taxes for the wealthiest does not cause economic growth, despite constant conservative claims that it will. Instead, tax cuts for the rich merely exacerbate income inequality.\"\n\nThis finding, by the Congress's own research service, essentially destroyed the foundation-stone of the Republican Party's economic arguments.

We're headed to a contested convention,\" Cruz told NBC News while shaking hands after his rally here in a state with 71 delegates up for grabs in next Tuesday's primary.\n\n\"The reason why he has so many of his media surrogates repeating the mantra that the race has got to be over now is because he knows he cannot earn a majority of the delegates in Cleveland,\" Cruz continued, calling Trump \"a fringe and marginal candidate.\"\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmbed Ted Cruz: We're fighting for the young people 3:11 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nCruz exited New York's primary without winning a single delegate, nearly mathematically vanishing his ability to win the nomination before the convention – a standard he often used last month to indirectly suggest John Kasich and, then, Marco Rubio should leave the race.\n\nDonald Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning: \"Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do.\"\n\nTed Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2016\n\nBut Trump – in order for him to win outright and avoid heading to a contested convention -- would still have to win 57 percent of the remaining delegates.\n\nThe Cruz campaign is now turning its attention to Pennsylvania, where 54 unbound delegates are in play next Tuesday.\n\nA top Cruz campaign aide, while acknowledging the narrative is unfavorable to Cruz in the northeast, said it's \"highly likely\" Cruz will pull at least 30 delegates out of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Donald and the media want to convince everyone that Pennsylvania is a suburb of Manhattan,\" said Cruz, adding: \"That's their telling -- Manhattan has spoken and Pennsylvania will quietly file into obedience.\"\n\nThe crowd defiantly jeered before Cruz finished his thought: \"You know what, I've got a lot more faith in the people of Pennsylvania.\"\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmbed Cruz: I've got 'more faith in the people of Pennsylvania' 1:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nWhile addressing the crowd, Cruz reframed the race and the role of Pennsylvania's delegates, exclaiming he'll \"take 'em\" next week.\n\nA campaign aide told NBC News it does not anticipate beating Trump in the popular vote in the state, meaning Cruz would lose out on its 17 at-large delegates, which go to the victor. Polls currently show Cruz losing by around 20 percentage points.\n\nBut each of the state's 18 congressional districts will elect three delegates to the national convention. The Cruz campaign is pushing a slate of Cruz-loyalists for 26 of the 54 unbound slots up for the taking. It says others eligible on the ballot to become delegates, particularly longtime state activists able to win on their name alone, have committed to Cruz as well. Cruz has personally met with several of the potential delegates.\n\nAt Cruz's Hershey rally, the campaign passed out a flier telling people to \"please vote for the delegates in your congressional district that are pledged to support [Cruz] at the convention.\"\n\nThe Cruz campaign passed out a flier telling people to \"please vote for the delegates in your congressional district that are pledged to support [Cruz] at the convention.\" Frank Thorp/NBC News\n\nThose delegates will be able to vote for whichever candidate they desire at the national convention in Cleveland, but the Cruz campaign says it recruited these specific individuals this winter to run as delegates after they pledged to vote for Cruz on the convention floor.\n\nThe campaign is now looking to target particular congressional districts where it sees itself as having the most viable opportunities to coalesce its supporters around its pre-designated slate of delegates.\n\n\"As you look at Erie, central Pennsylvania, look at the districts in southwestern Pennsylvania, you're going to see a lot of Senator Cruz in those areas over the next few days,\" said Lowman Henry, the state chair for Cruz, who compared the politics of the state to Wisconsin, where Cruz won big two weeks ago.\n\nPatti McCorkle, a mother who attended Cruz's rally at Hershey's antique car museum, defended the state's delegate system, adding she hoped \"it'll work out in this day and age to give us a Ted Cruz presidency.\"\n\nAnd citing the Constitution, she noted: \"Ted Cruz is for strong states' rights – as per the Constitution – and the states get to choose how their delegates are going",

      "About\n\nHi!\n\nMy name is Evangelina, I've been vegan since 2000 and have lived in Delaware all my life. Trust me when I say---we NEED a vegan bakery in town!\n\nI started my business in February of this year and have had nothing but great and encouraging feedback from friends, family, and customers. In order to continue to grow my business, I've decided to try this kickstarter thing. Since this is a new business and I'm doing everything entirely on my own, I'm not able to get a loan or line of credit and as everyone knows, it definitely takes money to make money. I'll do my best to explain in the following paragraphs what this project is all about and share updates with you all along the way! Thanks!\n\nPhoto by Lauren Watras (Watras Photography)\n\nVeganism is very important to me. So is chocolate cake. I started baking almost right after I went vegan and the first thing I was able to pull off was indeed.. chocolate cake. I didn't start getting serious about these cakes until my son was born. Every year I tried to make him a home-made birthday cake and the first few definitely flopped, but by the time he entered school he had the BEST cupcakes to bring to class!\n\nOne thing a lot of vegan parents worry about when their kids are small is that they'll feel left out in school events or that they may get picked on by the other kids. In order to prevent this, my approach was to make the coolest and most delicious vegan desserts for my son to bring to his school events. ...I guess you can say I'm a little competitive.\n\nMinecraft Creeper Cakes!\n\nQuality Ingredients\n\nAfter learning from various cook books I eventually began to create my own recipes to suit my personal taste. What I've learned is that the tastes that I enjoy happen to be enjoyed by many others! Which is great.\n\nSince deciding to start my own business I've learned even more about the ingredients I use, where they come from, and where I'd prefer to purchase from. I'm working on creating products that are organic, non-gmo, fair trade, and local wherever possible. Not because they're cool keywords, but because I believe that veganism should also include treating other human beings and the environment with respect. That also means that my ingredients are more expensive, but I'd rather pay an extra couple of bucks for cocoa that I know wasn't harvested by child slaves off the Ivory Coast than save a few dollars!\n\nValentine Cakes\n\nFood Dyes, Chemicals, and Artificial Ingredients\n\nPersonally, I prefer not to ingest food dyes wherever possible... but I do enjoy pretty colors! I use all natural, plant based food coloring. Unfortunately that doesn't give those bright vibrant colors that you get from chemical based colors, but at least you don't have to worry about the nasty side affects (unless you're allergic to the plants used) or possibility of animal testing on dyes. I've even created my own frosting recipes that are void of any partially or fully hydrogenated oils. I aim to create desserts that are better for your system than the regular store bought treats so that you can enjoy a dessert and not feel absolutely horrible after ingesting it.\n\nBraaaaaaaains...\n\nNerdy Cupcakes\n\nIf you haven't noticed (minecraft... brains... ) I enjoy making cupcakes with nerdy themes. I don't pride myself on being the most artistically gifted in crafting toppings and cake decorating, but I do like to have fun with it.\n\nI could go on and on! But you get the idea. My goal is to be able to make a living creating delicious treats for everyone (vegan and non-vegan alike) to enjoy in an effort to show the world that you can be vegan and still have good food. I've met a lot of \"almost vegan\" people over the years who admitted that sweets were their Achilles heel. Well, I want to make sure you have a fun and yummy cruelty-free option!",
      "In 1917 a pivotal event occurred for art and philosophy: Marcel Duchamp unveiled his artwork Fountain in Alfred Stieglitz's New York studio. This was simply a porcelain urinal, signed 'R. Mutt'.\n\nFountain was notorious, even for avant-garde artists. It has become one of the most discussed works of art of the 20th century. The Society of Independent Artists rejected it, though every artist who paid the exhibition fee was supposed to have their work shown. For almost a century, it has remained a difficult artwork. The philosopher John Passmore summed up Fountain as: 'a piece of mischief at the expense of the art world', though many have taken it very seriously.\n\nNo doubt there was some tomfoolery involved – Duchamp did not choose a urinal randomly. Yet there is more to Fountain than nose-thumbing. What makes this artwork so striking is its philosophical contribution.\n\nCommentators often highlight the influence of Fountain on conceptual art, and this most 'aggressive' readymade, as Robert Hughes put it, has certainly had an enduring legacy. In 2004, it was voted the most important 20th-century work by hundreds of art experts. From Andy Warhol to Joseph Beuys to Tracey Emin, this urinal inspired artists to reconsider the traditional artwork. Instead of paintings and sculptures, art was suddenly Brillo boxes, an unmade bed, or a light-bulb plugged into a lemon: ordinary objects, some readymade, removed from their original contexts and placed on display in art galleries. The art critic Roberta Smith sums it up this way: '[Duchamp] reduced the creative act to a stunningly rudimentary level: to the single, intellectual, largely random decision to name this or that object or activity \"art\".' As we will see, Duchamp's choice was not random at all, but Smith's description points to the broader shock that Duchamp's work prompted: if this can be art, then anything can.\n\nSince then, scholars have discussed Fountain to demonstrate a shift away from aesthetics to thought. As the philosopher Noël Carroll notes, it's possible to enjoy thinking about Duchamp's work without actually looking at it, which cannot be said for Henri Matisse's vivid paintings or Barbara Hepworth's dignified stone sculptures.\n\nThese traditional ideas, as we will see, are all important to Fountain. But they do not go far enough. They treat Fountain as art, but of a mocking sort: a kind of intellectual heckling that nudged artists to taunt and scoff more academically at their own field. Our explanation of the artwork's power is much more controversial: we believe that Fountain is art only insofar as it is not art. It is what it is not – and this is why it is what it is. In other words, the artwork delivers a true contradiction, what's called a dialetheia. Fountain did not simply usher in conceptual art – it afforded us an unusual and intriguing concept to consider: a work of art that isn't really a work of art, an everyday object that is not just an everyday object.\n\nHow is this possible? Let's begin with the obvious: Duchamp's Fountain really was a urinal. Not a painting or sculpture of a urinoir – though the latter might raise interesting philosophical questions – but the real thing, a token of a particular type – there were many visually indistinguishable urinals that came off the same production line. And just as importantly, Duchamp had no involvement whatsoever in designing or making the urinal that was the raw material for his artwork. His contribution was to sign the urinal, and exhibit it as art.\n\nIn his paper 'Art, Philosophy, and the Philosophy of Art' (1983), the philosopher Arthur Danto gave a helpful account of what happened when Duchamp did this. The urinal became, as Danto puts it, 'about something'. It was no longer primarily a useful object – it was primarily a meaningful object.\n\nThis is because the urinal was now part of what Danto called 'the artworld', in a 1964 article of the same name. The artworld is, simply put, a milieu in which objects can gain a new power: to express something beyond their ordinary utility. They are part of a new category, 'art', and gain a message that can be distinguished from their use or exchange value, and from the new category itself (a distinction we will come back to later). This is the famous aspect of art that the eye cannot, in Danto's word, 'descry', the non-visual aspect of some visual art.\n\nWarhol made his Brillo boxes from plywood, rather than taking boxes from a dry goods store; Duchamp didn't make a urinal, he displayed it in a new contextThis expression is not representation, as often understood: mimesis, or copying the likeness of some",
      "The Government has taken some action to address competition issues in New Zealand's building materials industry, but in my opinion, it needs to do a lot more. There's deep resentment and frustration among builders and homeowners alike, and it needs to be sorted out.\n\nWe've been told some of the deals hardware chains sign up to, which dictate that they only sell one brand of product, can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars annually for the shop or company head office. When having a look at the supply deals between Fletcher Building's Winstone Wallboards and the big hardware chains, the Commerce Commission said if rebates were stopped, it \"wouldn't expect\" to see any greater competitiveness in the market. It also said it didn't believe Winstone Wallboards was acting in an anti-competitive spirit.\n\nThat may be so, but what we witnessed at various stores seemed to make it pretty difficult for a competing brand of product to get any market traction whatsoever. In fact, we were even warned off buying anything else, and told a brand we know to be well respected (Elephant Plasterboard) had a \"bad reputation\".\n\nThese types of comments are seriously damaging for the company involved, Elephant Plasterboard, and the product it's worked hard to promote.\n\nComments like this also shape consumer opinion. If you're told a product is no good, you believe what you're told and you won't buy it. While comments like this, and exclusive supply deals to cut out competitors, might not meet the legal definition, it certainly seems like anti-competitive behavior if you ask me.\n\nI suspect some will say that perk trips to Fiji, tickets to All Blacks matches and cash bonuses for product loyalty are strategies employed by many businesses and so we shouldn't worry about it. That's a fair point, but I disagree, and here's why. Many advertising and marketing firms now have rules around disclosing these types of benefits, but in the building industry there is zero transparency. If you ask one of the big house-building companies to build you a home, chances are there will be an arrangement you won't be privy to, which dictates what type of materials are used.\n\nWe've seen contracts that give the house-building company cash for marketing and promotion and big discounts. But in exchange, the contract states the builder must remain loyal to a certain product, and if any prospective buyers ask you have to promote their brand and no other.\n\nConsidering how many Kiwis will renovate or even build a home in their lifetime, I think we should all know more about the perks and behind-the-scenes deals. Building materials and the industry in general are an integral part of the New Zealand economy.\n\nRebates and hidden contracts aside, one of the most common complaints we encountered was New Zealand's unwillingness to accept \"like for like\" products. If a product is approved and used in Germany, London and Australia, chances are you'll spend months and tens of thousands of dollars convincing certifying and appraisal groups in New Zealand that it's okay to be used here.\n\nMBIE says New Zealand has a unique environment and to an extent I accept that. We do have some of the highest UV levels in the world. But apart from that I would argue that it rains and gets windy in London, just like it does in New Zealand and we need to stop being so precious.\n\nThe upheaval involved in getting quality products approved for use here is a huge barrier to innovative and consumer choice, according to those we've interviewed.\n\nThere are also problems with council inspectors showing a bias towards particular products when signing off building plans. There is no clear path to product acceptance and serious inconsistencies when consenting authorities make decisions.\n\nMany council inspectors side with products they know, and in many instances, when an alternative product is specified, even if it's tested to an acceptable standard, the plans simply won't get signed off.\n\nMBIE accepts there are issues with product bias and they are looking at changing the rules to improve the situation.\n\nThere's also widespread concern about the independence of product testing groups like BRANZ. In fact, BRANZ itself initiated a review of its governance as a result of concern its decisions are being heavily influenced by industry players.\n\nAll of this is important stuff, and so we wanted to get insight from the Government. I did try to interview relevant ministers and the MBIE itself about the issues I've outlined.\n\nBut perhaps not surprisingly, we got back-down after back-down. After initially indicating interest, the Housing Minister said no to an interview. So we went to the Economic Development Minister who then referred us to the Commerce Minister or the Housing Minister. The Commerce Minister then told us it was really a matter for the Housing Minister, even though he's personally met with companies who have complained about aggressive marketing and the lack of competition. So we went to MBIE. At first it sounded keen to be part",

      "It has now been 3 months since N++ launched, and it's safe to say that there have been some highs and lows.\n\nOn the plus (plus) side, we're incredibly happy with N++. It's a great game that is close to what we wanted to make when we set out on this journey. We're so happy with how well the game has been received by critics and fans; there have been a lot of positive reviews, and it's been amazing hearing from players who really enjoy what we tried to do.\n\nWe're having a great time watching people stream N++, from casual players, to co-op streams, to people brave enough to pursue all-gold badges; especially awesome was a series of streams which showed someone tackling the secret challenges and unlocking the secret levels! Thank you so much to everyone who has streamed N++, we really love watching 🙂\n\nIt has also been amazingly gratifying to see so much creativity and awesomeness from the level-making community; we've been trying to document some of our favourites via the in-game \"Featured\" section, as well as on our tumblr: http://metanetsoftware.tumblr.com/\n\nUnfortunately, it hasn't all been positive. There are several bugs in the game, including a severe (thankfully, rare) savegame-corrupting bug. And, though not a bug, no one has yet managed to unlock the Platinum trophy by beating all of the levels in the game (including Co-op and Race). Rest assured, all of these issues will be addressed in an upcoming patch.\n\nWhich brings us to the major challenge we've been facing since launch: After N++ launched, Shawn (N++'s programmer) decided that he couldn't continue to help us make N++. We're currently working with him to get a patch ready that will fix all of the bugs and problems with the launch version, but his time is very limited. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\nDon't worry: we have had ups and downs over the entire 11-year course of this project — we didn't give up then and we don't intend to give up now. We're confident that we can find someone to continue the programming work required to move N++ forward into the future. This has definitely put a kink in our post-launch plans, and has made the future a lot more challenging than we had anticipated, but we are determined to make it a bright one regardless.\n\nWhat does this future hold? We're still excited about releasing updates which will add new content and features (we really can't wait for you all to try them), and we're also still working towards bringing N++ to more platforms — especially Steam, which is our top priority. We hope to have more news about these exciting new developments soon.\n\nFinally, at launch we announced that we would not be putting N++ on sale. While we had intended to push back firmly against the race to the bottom (following Dan Adelman's fearless example: http://gamasutra.com/blogs/DanAdelman/20150227/237639/On_Indie_Game_Pricing.php), it seems that the only tangible result of our decision has been to alienate a sizable portion of the audience. We really want as many people to play N++ as possible, and as a result we have decided we will be participating in a couple of promotional discounts in the future after all, to hopefully encourage more people to give N++ a try. Again, stay tuned as we will announce any news on twitter (https://twitter.com/metanetsoftware) as soon as we have it.\n\nWe really want to wholeheartedly thank everyone who has already given N++ a try — we really appreciate it and we hope you're enjoying it so far. There's more to enjoy on the way! We are committed to bringing N++ to as many people as possible, because we know that we have made something that is worthy of being played — and although that means reconsidering some of our positions and making some difficult choices, it's important to figure out how to get people to play it and how to continue to support the community of players. So aside from the updates and bugfixes, that's what we're working on now.\n\nIf there's anything that developing and playing N++ has taught us, it's that you can never lose as long as you never give up. This is a lesson we intend to follow. We need to extend our heartfelt thanks to you, our players, for the encouragement and support you've offered us over the years. We hope to have more exciting news for you in the near future 🙂\n\nOn an upbeat note, if you're in the New York City area mid-November, there are two events you might be interested in!

      "Expressive aphasia, also known as Broca's aphasia, is a neurological condition characterized by an individual's inability to produce grammatically correct speech, often due to a physical impact or alteration to the anterior regions of the brain, which impairs the proper function of neurons that would otherwise help construct vocalizations of grammatically correct sentences [1]. In the suburbs of Paris, France in 1861, Paul Broca identified the location of the region responsible for expressive aphasia after he conducted an autopsy of a patient incapable of uttering any word other than \"tan\" [2]. Though speculations of the structure and function of human consciousness had existed for several centuries, Broca's discovery resulted in a new framework for understanding the brain's role in producing conscious experience. The patient's brain incurred a lesion from injury, and only a small subset of his cognitive function was impaired. Naturally, psychologists concluded that different parts of the brain mediate different cognitive processes. By 1874, Carl Wernicke discovered receptive aphasia (Wernicke's aphasia), which results from damage to posterior regions of the brain [3], and increasing numbers of scientists began exploring which regions of the brain were responsible for different aspects of cognition. Brain science adopted a new goal: mapping the locations of the brain corresponding to each observable function in human consciousness.\n\nFor many years, much of neurology and cognitive psychology consisted of research based on assumptions extrapolated from Broca's and Wernicke's conclusions. Since the brains of humans, chimpanzees, rats, and many of our other mammalian cousins did not exhibit much structural change past adolescence, the brain appeared to be a large circuit produced from the blueprint of our DNA. Studies of damage to isolated regions of the brain also revealed damage to isolated cognitive functions. Researchers followed this chain of cause and effect to a seemingly logical conclusion: parts of the brain are hardwired from birth to perform specific tasks. The occipital lobe processes vision. The temporal lobe provides networks for face recognition, emotion, long-term memory, and hearing. The parietal lobe processes taste, touch, pressure sensitivity, and kinesthetics. The frontal lobe is involved in speech, smells, emotions, language, problem solving, and personality. The cerebellum coordinates fine motor skills and balance. The limbic system controls emotional responses. This functional division of the brain, further subdivided into smaller layers and regions, was considered to be an increasingly complete map of the cognitive networks endowed by our DNA.\n\nIt took nearly a full century after Broca's discovery before the borders lining the map of the human brain became a bit more fuzzy. By the late 1960's, neuroplasticity became prominently recognized as a possible alternative explanation of the distribution of cognitive functions across neurons [4]. Though genes do influence the structure and function of the brain, they also provide countless homeostatic and adaptive mechanisms that allow the brain to adjust in physical structure to accommodate new kinds of cognitive processes. Learning can not only occur within regions identified as performing a specific task, but also within regions ordinarily dedicated to other tasks. When a region of the brain is not actively used, its neurons are not simply left alone. Sometimes, those neurons are slowly repurposed to perform a different task—direct evidence of the plasticity of the brain.\n\nCountless studies have revealed the effectiveness of the human brain in reorganizing its structure to accommodate for different streams of information as well as the corresponding cognitive processes required to interpret the information effectively. One such study that received significant public attention was VS Ramachandran's successful attempt in 1995 to treat phantom limb pain [5]. When a patient suffering from an injury receives an amputation, they may sometimes experience a confounding feeling that the limb is still attached to their body. Although their visual system perceives that their limb is missing, their somatosensory system continues to provide them with tactile and kinesthetic feedback mimicking the movements and position of the missing limb. Although some patients are able to adjust to the strange sensation, the phantom limb can sometimes result in overwhelming phantom pain from a clenching or tensing of phantom muscles—pain that shouldn't exist, but somehow continues to be perceived despite the limb's absence. Ramachandran's experiment used a mirror box to provide a reflection of the intact limb that wasn't amputated. By looking at the mirror and moving their intact limb, a patient would receive visual feedback that appeared as though they were able to control their phantom limb. Over time, some patients were able to reduce the pain they experienced by tricking their sensory system into perceiving that their phantom limb was no longer in a painful position. Upon examination via brain imaging, the therapy appeared to result in significant cortical reorganization in successful patients, indicating that the approach takes advantage of brain plasticity [6]. Although some patients have benefited from this therapy, a standardized procedure has not yet been established—further experimentation is required to understand the generalizability of the results [7]. Although the mirror box experiment has not yet",

      "BBC World News America's Washington correspondent Katty Kay doesn't appreciate the low regard Trump fans have for the press. Appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Thursday, Kay lamented that the President-elect \"certainly feels the freedom to go around [reporters]\", complaining, \"his supporters would probably agree with that strategy because they don't have much respect for the media anyway.\"\n\nHost Joe Scarborough began:\n\n\"Katty Kay, let's talk about the media and the media tweets and just Donald Trump's approach to the media. A lot of people, I think, that are being hyperbolic saying that he's going to be like Putin and drag them off to jail.... That's never going to happen but I do think he is at war with the media on another front, he feels they were wrong about him during the primary. They were! He feels they were wrong about his chances during the general election. They were! And he knows he's got, what, 15, 20, 25 million people and knows he can get a message out and bypass everybody. I do think that, for instance, CNN is his target right now. Morning Joe was his target this past summer. The New York Times is a target right now. I think he feels the freedom that other people have not felt in the past to go over, around them and to bash them head-on.\n\nHowever, Kay appeared to criticize Trump's approach to responding to the liberal press, as being beneath the office of President:\n\nKATTY KAY: It does raise a bigger question, I think, his tweets about the media particularly when he takes on one single reporter or one single news outlet. You raised The Crown earlier and we had in one episode the question about reverence for the office…is there something in Donald Trump's tweeting and in the way he tweets when he's being petulant about one reporter or other risks undermining the reverence we hold for the office of the presidency. I mea,n it's one thing to communicate in an modern and up front way that his supporters like and that seems to have no -- that tells it like is, which is what people like. It's another to perhaps tarnish the reputation of the office. Maybe that's being old fashioned of me.\n\nMSNBC talk show host Al Sharpton offered his opinion as to why Trump has such deep disdain for elites:\n\nAL SHARPTON: I think it also speaks to something deeper than that a New Yorker can understand. Donald Trump and his father were out-of-borough guys who felt they were fighting the Manhattan elite that controlled real estate and everything else. And even though he and I would debate and fight, we always saw it the same way; out-of-borough guys that were underestimated, he was a Queens guy, he had money but he was a Queens guy. He was not accepted at the power spots. He didn't have breakfast at the Regency and I think that his taking on a lot of the CNNs and The New York Times was - you guys always underestimated us…\n\nHowever, Sharpton then went to offer his advice on how the media should fight Trump:\n\nSHARPTON: I also think that therein lies the strategic way to fight him because he wants to show that he can be bigger than he's expected to be, and he wants to be great. I think that's why if you combat him, he's going to combat back. If he is being appealed to that he can show that he can be everything everyone thought he couldn't be, he might rise to a different occasion which is why I'm going to challenge him in a strategic way because I think that's really at core, he's proving something even where he is now.\n\nScarborough expanded on that by repeating his warning to liberal elites in the media and politics, not to underestimate Trump, especially now that he surprisingly won the election. Also, saying that there is historical precedent to what has happened, citing previous Presidents: Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower and Theodor Roosevelt in a discussion with a guest presidential historian.\n\nHere is the excerpt from the December 1st discussion on Morning Joe:",

      "The FBI has given Hillary Clinton a huge boost with just hours to go in the US presidential campaign by clearing her of wrongdoing following a new trawl of email material.\n\nFBI director James Comey told Congress on Sunday that Mrs Clinton should not face charges over messages found on the computer of disgraced politician Anthony Weiner - the estranged husband of the Democratic candidate's close aide Huma Abedin.\n\nHe said the bureau had come to the same conclusion it reached in July, when it ruled that Mrs Clinton was \"extremely careless\" in handling classified information while Secretary of State, but that her conduct did not amount to criminality.\n\n0:36 Video: Trump on FBI's decision to clear Clinton\n\nMr Comey said that the FBI had worked \"around the clock to process and review a large number of emails\".\n\nHe did not say how many emails were looked at - some reports said there were 650,000 - nor did he reveal any details about what was found.\n\n:: Analysis - Clinton cleared but what is the damage?\n\nA spokesman for Mrs Clinton's campaign team said they were \"glad\" that the issue had been \"resolved\".\n\nThe US stock market reacted positively to the news.\n\nFutures on the S&P 500 increased by 1.4% to 2,108.25, while futures based on the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average were also up - by 1.1%, at 17,999.\n\n1:36 Video: Hillary Clinton's email problems explained\n\nDonald Trump - who had praised the FBI for launching the review - responded by returning to his claim that Mrs Clinton is being protected by a \"rigged system\".\n\nThe property tycoon insisted at a rally in the Detroit suburbs that it would have been impossible for the FBI to review the huge tranche of emails in so short a time.\n\nHe said: \"Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, The FBI knows it. The people know it.\"\n\nMr Comey's announcement that agents would be reviewing more emails shook up the race for the White House with just 11 days to go - when Mrs Clinton appeared to be building an unassailable lead.\n\nSome commentators described the development as an \"almost nightmare scenario\" for Mrs Clinton's campaign, while the FBI director faced criticism from Democrats and Republicans for turning the investigation \"into a political football\" .\n\nImage: The letter from James Comey confirming no criminal case against Clinton\n\nThe revelation helped deflect attention away from allegations of sexual assault by 12 women against Mr Trump and coincided with the race tightening in key battleground states.\n\n:: Parties battle for Latino vote in Arizona\n\nOn Sunday night, Mrs Clinton told suporters in Manchester, New Hampshire, that the US was facing a \"moment of reckoning\" on election day - when voters must choose between \"division and unity\".\n\nShe was introduced by Khizr Khan, the Muslim-American father of a slain Gold Star soldier who came under attack by Mr Trump in one of the most damaging episodes of the Republican candidate's rollercoaster campaign.\n\n0:33 Video: Clinton communications manager reacts to news on emails\n\nIn a powerful address, Mr Khan said: \"Mr Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Khan, have a place in your America?\n\n\"Would Muslims have a place in your America? Would Latinos have a place in your America? Would African-Americans have a place in your America, Donald Trump?\n\n\"Would anyone who isn't like you have a place in your America, Donald Trump?\n\n\"Well thankfully, Mr Trump, this isn't your America. And on Tuesday, we're going to prove America belongs to all of us.\"\n\nReports from Florida suggest a surge in turnout among African-American and Hispanic voters - which could be bad news for Mr Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, the last day of voting before election day on Tuesday - hundreds of people attended \"souls to the polls\" events, aimed at encouraging churchgoers to vote in the key swing state.\n\n1:07 Video: Clinton shoring up Democratic states\n\nDaniel Smith, a University of Florida professor who tracks voter turnout, said: \"Over the past few days, we've seen black turnout explode, with more African-Americans voting early in-person than in 2012, and we still have 'Souls to the Polls' numbers from today to add to the running total,\"\n\nAs of Saturday, 565,000 Hispanics had voted in person in Florida, a 100% increase over the close of early voting in 2012, according to Mr Smith.\n\nIn another sign of voter enthusiasm, of the 911,000 Hispanics who have already voted this year - whether in person or by mail - 36% did not vote in the last presidential election.\n\n:: Sky News will bring you every twist and turn of the US election results - and we're the only UK news organisation which will bring you details of the official",

      "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny speaks during a meeting with locals for the upcoming Democratic coalition primary election in Novosibirsk.\n\nAuthorities in central Russia have removed billboards inviting local residents to attend a Tuesday talk by opposition leader Alexei Navalny, his allies said, marking the latest hindrance to the plans by political opposition to compete in regional elections.\n\nBillboards in Kostroma, about 200 miles northeast of Moscow, were taken down over the weekend, less than a day after they went up, Navalny ally Leonid Volkov said via Twitter.\n\n\"In Kostroma, they stole all four billboards. Advertising people have been summoned to the mayor's office and threatened with having their licenses revoked,\" Volkov said.\n\nThe billboards advertised a \"meeting with Alexei Navalny\" to take place Tuesday, according to a photo posted by the opposition leader.\n\nThe billboards were removed just as Russia's President Vladimir Putin suggested in an interview with an Italian newspaper that political opposition in his country was free to express its views.\n\nAsked by a correspondent for Corriere della Sera ahead of his visit to Italy about the reasons Russian television channels rarely air interviews with opposition leaders, Putin responded: \"If they become interesting, I think they will be interviewed more often,\" according to a transcript published on the Kremlin website.\n\nLiberal Russian media, including the independent Novaya Gazeta weekly, published the news under headlines saying that Putin has denied the existence of \"political censorship\" in Russia.\n\nNavalny said he learned about the removal of the Kostroma billboards \"right after reading V.V. Putin's proclamation to Italian journalists that we have no political censorship on television.\"\n\nThe removal of the ad also came a day after Navalny cheered the appearance of the \"first billboard in my life.\"\n\n\"Had never been permitted one before anywhere,\" he said via Twitter, adding: \"Kostroma, mon amour.\"\n\nThis weekend, Navalny visited Siberia's biggest city, Novosibirsk, to urge voters to participate in primaries that will choose opposition candidates for regional elections.\n\n\nIt was his first trip out of Moscow in three years.\n\n\nNavalny was banned from leaving the capital while his trial on corruption charges moved through the system. Navalny's allies described the trial as politically motivated.\n\n\nIn December, Navalny was given a suspended sentence in the case, but his younger brother, Oleg, was sentenced to more than three years in prison.",

      "\"Hi, I'm Peyton Manning and I'm running for the U.S. Senate.\"\n\nAs soon as Tennessee senator Bob Corker announced his plans to retire Wednesday, speculation about who would take his place began. And in the era of President Donald Trump and future senator Kid Rock, it is required that one of the potential successors be a celebrity. In this case it's Peyton Manning.\n\nThe former NFL quarterback who starred at the University of Tennessee before playing for the Colts and Broncos could find his second act in politics, some pundits are suggesting. At least one congressman says he could see it too. Tennessee representative Scott DesJarlais told Business Insider that Manning may make a Senate run, but said the 41-year-old is more likely to wait until 2020, when Senator Lamar Alexander, who will be 80 on Election Day, faces reelection. Corker himself was asked about the possibility of Manning running and told Politico that \"it's possible,\" but not likely.\n\nIf Manning does call an audible (Omaha!) and take a run at 2018, he'll likely do so against veteran politicians. Representative Marsha Blackburn and Governor Bill Haslam are the early GOP favorites. But unlike those two, Manning doesn't have a record of public political positions or experience in office that would provide some clues as to how he might legislate. Still, he's provided some clues.\n\nOver the years, Manning has donated thousands to GOP politicians, including Corker, former Law & Order star and presidential candidate Fred Thompson and George W. Bush. In the 2016 presidential election, Manning and his brother Eli joined team Jeb! In 2012, he gave generously to Mitt Romney.\n\nIf Manning's preference in politicians is any indication of his own leanings, then he's an Establishment Republican in the mold of Corker himself. But we might get a little more insight on where Manning stands by looking at the people he's gone into business with, specifically Papa John's CEO John Schnatter, the first person Manning kissed after winning the Super Bowl last year.\n\nThe business relationship between Manning and Schnatter began in 2012 when Manning bought 21 Papa John's franchises in Denver after joining the Broncos. Several months prior, Schnatter complained about the onerous effects of Obamacare, which he said would require a price hike of 11 to 14 cents per pizza to pay for employee health insurance. That, he suggested, was a bad thing.\n\nIn recent years, Schnatter, whom Manning has appeared alongside in plenty of Papa John's commercials, has closely aligned himself with the Koch brothers. Together they have opened centers of \"free enterprise\" at the Universities of Louisville and Kentucky, along with Schnatter's alma mater Ball State. While ostensibly dedicated to exploring free-market principles, these academic centers have another goal, as Charles Koch admitted to Forbes in 2015. \"You've gotta change the hearts and minds of the people to understand what really makes society fairer and what's going to change their lives. And it's not more of this government control,\" he said.\n\nIt's unfair to transpose all of the Kochs' opinions onto Manning, and his lack of publicly articulated policy positions makes it hard to pin down any specific areas of agreements. But there is at least one issue on which Manning has publicly indicated a willingness to break with conservative orthodoxy and align himself with the libertarian leanings of the Koch brothers — marijuana legalization. When Manning bought his Denver pizza places in 2012, just after the state voted to legalize weed, he cited that, perhaps jokingly, as a motivating factor. David and Charles Koch, too, appear to be \"down with marijuana.\"\n\nAdmittedly, there isn't much to go on when trying to decipher Manning's politics, but there's enough to know that he's the kind of Establishment candidate that President Trump might campaign against. It's hard to see him winning the support of Trump's biggest booster, Steve Bannon. But he does have one thing working for him when it comes to Trump: The president already admires Manning, a fellow celebrity and Saturday Night Live host.\n\n\"I very much have always liked Peyton Manning,\" Trump said on CBS's Face the Nation ahead of Super Bowl 50 in 2016. \"He is a very good guy. I know him. And he is a very, very good guy.\"\n\nNot long after, Manning was asked about that endorsement and prodded to provide one of his own for Trump. Like a seasoned politician, he demurred.\n\nThese days, it's still not clear if Manning has fully boarded the Trump train, but he's at least indicated a willingness not to throw himself on the tracks. Last July, he posed for a selfie with Donald Trump Jr. And in January, just days after Trump's inauguration, Manning spoke at a GOP retreat in Philadelphia. A couple months later, after Politico reported that Manning had his eye on Alexander's seat in 2020, Manning said he has \"no interest in the political world.\" Given the reports to the contrary, it's a little hard",
      "4925838\n\nJudge Andrew Napolitano says Hillary Clinton \"should be terrified\" her IT technician, Bryan Pagliano, was granted immunity by a federal judge.\n\nIn an interview on Fox Business' \"Varney & Co\" on Thursday, Napolitano said that because Pagliano was granted immunity, the Justice Department is \"going to seek indictment\" of either Clinton or one of her subordinates. (RELATED: Justice Department Grants Immunity To Hillary Clinton's Email Server Technician) In an interview on Fox Business' \"Varney & Co\" on Thursday, Napolitano said that because Pagliano was granted immunity, the Justice Department is \"going to seek indictment\" of either Clinton or one of her subordinates.\n\nHost Stuart Varney began by asking Napolitano, \"[T]he guy gets immunity. There is… a grand jury has been empaneled and is hearing evidence, surly Hillary should be worried about this?\"\n\n\"Hillary should be terrified and I'll tell you why,\" Napolitano said. If Clinton gave Pagliano her \"personal Secretary of State password\" then \"we have an indictment for misconduct in office as well as espionage.\"\n\nClinton \"should be terrified of the fact that he's been granted immunity. Now, what does granted immunity mean? Only a federal judge can grant immunity. A federal judge will only grant immunity if a sitting jury is ready to hear testimony from the immunized person. So we know a couple of things. We know the recommendation we were waiting for from the FBI to the Justice Department has already made its way from the FBI to the Justice Department.\"\n\n\"We know FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors are working in tandem,\" Napolitano added. \"We know that they went through this lengthy process of interviewing Mr. Pagliano and finding out what he knows and deciding it's so valuable they need him to say it to a grand jury and the only way he can say it to a grand jury is if they promise not prosecute him and hence he gets immunity and we also know they're going to seek indictment because they would not be immunizing him and thereby inducing him to spill his guts, unless they wanted to indict someone. And we don't know who it is. There's four or five people in between Pagliano and Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nNapolitano was then asked about the statement from Clinton campaign spokesman Bran Fallon that said, Clinton has \"encouraged everyone to cooperate because we want to make every good-faith effort to be transparent and answer any questions people have. With Mr. Pagliano, we encouraged him as well because we don't think he has any reason to not be transparent about the help that he provided from an IT perspective, but unfortunately, it is his choice what to do.\"\n\nShould Hillary Clinton Drop Out Of The Presidential Election?

      "As US Election Day closes in, the wife of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump made a rare campaign speech in Pennsylvania. At the speech's end, Melania Trump told the crowd what will be her cause should she win the privilege to be First Lady: cyberbullying.\n\n\"Technology has changed our universe,\" said Melania Trump on Thursday. \"But like anything that is powerful, it can have a bad side. Children and teenagers can be fragile. They are hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks or intelligence. This makes their life hard and can force them to hide and retreat... It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied, or attacked. It is terrible when that happens on the playground. And it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet.\"\n\nShe ended by promising to make cyberbullying one of her \"main focuses\" in the White House.\n\nFirst ladies—and potential \"first gentlemen\"—typically champion a somewhat bland cause that most everyone agrees with. Fighting cyberbullying could conceivably fit that mold, but much of the commentary on Melania's speech focused on her husband's own use of social media.\n\nThe specific references to bullies attacking others over their looks or intelligence stuck out, since Donald Trump has been criticized for mocking the physical appearance of Ted Cruz's wife, former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, and at least one of the women who accused him of sexual assault. Among political candidates, Trump is likely the record-holder for having called the most number of people \"stupid.\"\n\nNo surprise, the speech led to plenty of commentary in the media noting some of Trump's more bully-like behavior.\n\n\"All I kept thinking was, 'Have you met Donald Trump?'\" asked CNN's Dana Bash, who reported on the speech.\n\nThe speech was surely an \"epic troll,\" suggested Maureen Callahan at the New York Post, since it \"describes, more than anyone America currently knows, our most prolific and popular cyber-bully, one with 12 million Twitter followers.\"\n\n\"Isn't the problem at her own dinner table?\" Anderson Cooper asked Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.\n\n\"I never felt so bad for anybody in my life,\" said Bill Clinton at a campaign event for his wife. \"I thought, 'Yeah, especially if it's done at three o'clock in the morning against a former Miss Universe by a guy running for president!'\"\n\nElection Day is on Tuesday, of course, so we'll soon know whether cyberbullying is an issue that will have the attention of the First Spouse, whoever it may be.",
      "Washington Post Staff Writer\n\nThursday, August 26, 2004; Page A21\n\nA report that found that illegal immigrants in the United States cost the federal government more than $10 billion a year -- a sum it estimated would almost triple if they were given amnesty -- has drawn criticism from immigration advocacy groups.\n\nFor its report, the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that advocates tougher immigration policies, used Census Bureau figures to compare the revenue that illegal immigrants contribute through taxes with the cost of government services they use.\n\n\"Households headed by illegal aliens imposed more than $26.3 billion in costs on the federal government in 2002 and paid only $16 billion in taxes, creating a net fiscal deficit of $10.4 billion, or $2,700 per illegal household,\" said Steven A. Camarota, author of the study.\n\nThe costs outlined in the report include government services such as Medicaid, medical treatment for the uninsured, food assistance programs, the federal prison and court systems, and federal aid to schools.\n\nThe study acknowledged that, on average, the costs that illegal-immigrant households bear on the federal government are less than half that of other households, and that many of those costs relate to their U.S.-born children. It also pointed out that tax payments by illegal-immigrant households constitute one-fourth those of other households because of low-income jobs.\n\n\"With nearly two-thirds of illegal aliens lacking a high school degree, the primary reason they create a fiscal deficit is their low education levels and resulting low incomes and tax payments, not their legal status or heavy use of most social services,\" Camarota said.\n\nThe report estimates that granting legal status to illegal immigrants would dramatically increase their cost, causing the net fiscal deficit to rise to nearly $29 billion because, the author argues, unskilled immigrants would have access to more government services while continuing to make modest tax payments.\n\nCamarota concluded in his report that the fiscal impact could be lessened only by stringently enforcing immigration laws, a view that drew criticism from some immigration specialists and advocacy groups that also accused him of not coming up with constructive recommendations.\n\n\"Implied within this study's findings is the sense that if these people could suddenly be made to disappear, the federal government would be $10 billion to the plus, and that is almost certainly not true once you look at the numbers,\" Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer at the Urban Institute, said in an interview.\n\n\"Should you charge up to undocumented aliens the cost of small-business loans that they don't get or the cost of civil litigation, among other things? This report does that,\" he said.\n\nFrank Sharry, director of the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy group, took issue with the report's treatment of illegal immigrants' U.S.-born children, who are American citizens.\n\n\"The costs of the children of immigrants are accounted for [in the report], but not their contributions to the economy as workers and taxpayers,\" he said in a written statement, adding that the report's conclusions were not helpful to the debate on immigration reform.",
      "An Instagram from Amber Rose that appears to endorse the clothing shop Fashion Nova. The FTC included this example in its letter to her.\n\nThe FTC has taken a big step in cracking down on celebrities doing shady Instagram ads by sending a new set of warning letters to 21 celebrities that require them to respond.\n\n\nSome celebrity Instagram ads are obvious and easy to identify, but there are many that are confusing or unclear. And a lot of celebrities and influencers don't properly disclose their #sponsored posts. A report on the top 50 most popular celebrities showed that 93% of the ads they did were not properly disclosed.\n\nAccording to the FTC's guidelines, you're supposed to disclose an ad if you have a \"material connection\" to a product or brand. That means you're not only supposed to say #ad if it was a very straightforward thing where you were paid to post about a product, but also if you were given a free gift (like clothes or a free private jet ride), or if you have a big endorsement deal with a brand, like Rihanna and Puma, or Kendall Jenner being the \"face\" of Esteé Lauder. Nebulous hashtags like #partner or just tagging the sponsor aren't considered proper disclosures.\n\nIn March, the FTC sent \"educational\" letters to a 43 celebrities/influencers as well as brands, reminding them of the rules that they have to disclose if their posts are ads.\n\nIn the past, the FTC has only gone after against brands, not celebrities, for undisclosed social media ads. The \"educational\" letters to celebs were a new tactic, but they were still a step away from a real enforcement action, and the FTC said in the March letter that they were not attempting to verify if posts in question were ads or not. These new warning letters sent on September 6 are a step further, and now the FTC wants the celebrities to officially respond to the letters.\n\nThe FTC did not have any additional comment on these letters.\n\nFor example, the letter the FTC sent to Ciara about a photo of sneakers she posted on Instagram on May 8 reads [emphasis added]:",
      "\"Nine times out of 10 or more they're being confronted by that suspect. It's the suspect's actions that dictate the situation,\" said George. \"If people would just do what they are told, whether they think the officer is right or wrong, they just do what they are told these situations wouldn't happen 99.9% of the time.\"",
      "IT is possible we are just a dream. But are we? You ever have those \"realistic dreams\"? Where when you wake up it feels so real, you could swear it happened. How do we know that this isn't all a dream? A subconscious way of showing our pro-conscious that if we lived life a certain way, our choices would cause a certain effect. This could all be a moving image, like a movie that never ends unless we make it end in our conscious. It could actually, be possible. Research has showed many patients in Austrailia and Greece that were under a \"coma\" like life since they have been born. How do we not know that our \"bodies\" are in some other place in a \"coma\" like way, and we are the thoughts. (to make it clear, if someone is in a coma, they can not move or speak. But can hear everything outside that is being said to them.) so, our \"thoughts\" or \"the little voice in our head\" could be the people talking around us where our \"coma\" like body really is. Better yet, we could just simply be a character in our bodies dream that our body wants to be,or maybe that is dreaming of to be. In the brain, there are certain parts that can make the human body be in a \"sleep\" mode. But our brains are still working, just from the outside we look dead. Like a zombie perhaps? Maybe that's where the zombie comes from? Our \"coma\" body might not want our life to end. So even after they body makes us die in it\"s \"dream\" we could be a \"zombie\" or a half alive person that is still thirsty for life. I don't believe in god, so i don't know if hell and heaven are even there.

Plus 4 bonus tips that have helped me distinguish my space not just as a house, but as home.\n\n\"Elegance allows no resentment.\" ~ Chogyam Trungpa\n\nLast night I hosted a cozy, simple, elegant, eco-responsible Thanksgiving in my home.\n\nMost of what worked was thanks to my guests, who are like a second family to me: they cooked amazing food, they invited conversation and toasts during the meal, the children helped us all to celebrate (and go play outside after dinner).\n\nIt was a night where my house became a home. I say home, not house, because though I've owned my house for eight years, it's been a journey.\n\nSee also: 3 Steps to a Healthy Home\n\nMy house can be a source of coziness when I'm down (I was just sick for 10 days), a source of upliftedness and renewal.

      "G.I. Joe was the codename for America's daring, highly trained special missions force. Its purpose was to defend human freedom against Cobra, a ruthless terrorist organization determined to rule the world. From 1982 until 1994, Hasbro's G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero was one of the driving forces in kid's entertainment, conquering the worlds of comic books, animated television, and tiny toy action figures. With so many facets to the fandom, we thought it was time to fill you in on the history of this influential media monster.\n\nTHE ORIGINS OF A HERO\n\nG.I. Joe began life as a nearly 12-inch military toy in 1964, creating a whole new category of \"action figures\" for boys that rivaled Mattel's Barbie doll in popularity. Sales began to slip over time, so, in 1970, Hasbro changed Joe from a soldier to an \"action hero,\" trading his tanks and jeeps for inflatable rafts and a patented \"kung fu grip.\" By the time the line was cancelled in 1976, Joe had become something of a superhero, incorporating fantastic elements like the chrome-plated Bulletman and the bionic limbs of Atomic Man, who battled The Intruders, a group of cavemen from outer space.\n\nAn Uphill Battle\n\nBy 1979, Hasbro's Head of Boy's Toys, Bob Prupis, was ready to bring Joe back. Prupis' secret plan for the G.I. Joe reboot, code named \"Operation: Blast Off\" on internal memos, was a Mission: Impossible-style toy line that had one foot in the future, with the other grounded in contemporary military technology. It would feature science fiction-inspired weapons like laser artillery and jet packs, next to realistic depictions of tanks, rocket launchers, and submachine guns. However, his idea was met with resistance from Hasbro executives.\n\nOne of the first hurdles Prupis had to clear was the price of petroleum. Middle East oil suppliers had cut production, causing the cost of petroleum to jump from $15 to nearly $40 per barrel. The increased expense of this raw material for plastic would have to be passed on to the consumer, meaning the retail price of new 12-inch G.I. Joe figures and vehicles would be too high for the average household.\n\nSo Prupis took inspiration from the \"little green army men\" he used to play with as a child, as well as from the popular Star Wars line of action figures produced by rival toy company, Kenner, and sized Joe down to 3 3/4-inches high to save on plastic. But even the smaller Joe concept was turned down by management, simply because it \"wasn't exciting enough.\" For the next two years, Prupis kept going back to the drawing board to try to find some new hook that would make Hasbro bite, but he was rebuffed every time.\n\nTwo-Week Notice\n\nThen, in 1981, after yet another failed attempt to get Blast Off off the ground, Prupis was told that he had one more shot with Joe, or else he needed to move on to other ideas. Prupis would be given two weeks with Griffin-Bacal, the marketing firm that managed Hasbro's advertising, to see if he could come up with something to get kids excited about G.I. Joe again. Prupis pulled together a team, including Kirk Bozigian from marketing and toy designers Ron Rudat and Greg Bernstein, to brainstorm product and promotional ideas.\n\nAlthough they came up with a lot of fun concepts, they faced a big marketing stumbling block—there was no G.I. Joe movie to tie into like Kenner had with Star Wars. Instead, it was suggested that a comic book might work just as well.\n\nMarvel-ous Assist\n\nJust how Marvel Comics and Hasbro came together is a mix of legend, reality, and fuzzy memories from nearly 40 years ago. One version of the story states that the CEO of Hasbro and the president of Marvel met in the men's room at a charity function, where the two got to talking shop. However, Hasbro's Bozigian says that it was Griffin-Bacal that contacted Marvel to discuss working on G.I. Joe. Whatever the case, Marvel was willing to help, and the relationship between the two companies was born.\n\nMarvel took a special interest in G.I. Joe, because Griffin-Bacal wanted to try something new for the comic book—television advertising. There were government regulations required for toy commercials, including: restrictions on runtime; the ad had to show kids playing with the actual toys; and animation was limited to only a few seconds. However, there were no such rules regarding advertising for comic books, because it had simply never been done before. Griffin-Bacal took the risky move of dedicating $3 million to create a series of 30-second animated",

      "I know renaming an AD domain sounds bad, and it is in some cases, and that's why you need to take time and think about what the domain name should be for the company. But mistakes happen, or you just have a bunch of clients that have bad domain names for their environment and need to be changed. Now, if their domain controllers are running 2003 server you are good-to-go, because starting with 2003, you can rename the domain name. If they don't have 2003, well…upgrade, or create a new domain. If Microsoft Exchange is present in the infrastructure, your out of luck, because domain rename is not supported. It was in Exchange 2003, but starting with Exchange 2007 this option is gone. If you have an internal Certification Authority this will complicate things, so for the sake of this example I am not going to have one.\n\nFor this guide I have two domain controllers running Windows server 2008 R2, and two clients running Windows 7 and Windows XP that are joined to the domain \"vkernel.local\". We are going to rename this domain from vkernel.local to mynewdomain.local. I know is not a great name, but this way you will know which is the old domain and which is the new one. The account used for this procedures needs to have enterprise permissions.\n\nJust as an warning…before we move along, backup up your domain controllers just in case something goes wrong. One other thing; until you have completed all the procedures, discontinue the following activities:\n\nCreating new domains in or removing existing domains from your forest.\n\nCreating new application directory partitions in, or removing existing application directory partitions from, your forest.\n\nAdding domain controllers to or removing domain controllers from your forest.\n\nCreating or deleting shortcut trusts within your forest.\n\nAdding attributes to or removing attributes from the set of attributes that replicate to the global catalog (called the partial attribute set).\n\nNow, let's set up a control station from where we can manage all this. The control station needs to run a Windows server platform, and be a domain member. If you are running 2003 as the OS for the control station, you need to install the Windows Support Tools available on the 2003 media (support\\tools folder) or download from here. If you are using 2008 R2 those tools are available as a feature. Open Server Manager, right-click Features and check the box AD DS and AD LDS Tools on the Select Feature page. Click Add Required Features on the window that pops-up.\n\nWhen done, reboot the server.\n\nAs you can see in the screens bellow my Windows clients are login in the vkernel.local domain, and is time to change that.\n\nFirst task is to create a new DNS zone. Open the console, right-click the Forward Lookup Zone and choose New Zone.\n\nOn the Welcome page on the New Zone Wizard click Next.\n\nWe need to create an Active Directory Integrated Zone, so make sure the Primary zone radio button is selected and the box Store the zone in Active Directory is checked.\n\nChoose how this zone will replicate in your environment then click Next to continue.\n\nIn the box, type the name of your new AD domain name then hit Next.\n\nLeave the default option here since is the most secure one.\n\nAt the end click Finish to close the wizard.\n\nThe new zone is now created and displayed under the Forward Lookup Zone in the DNS console.\n\nBefore we move along with this I want to tell you one very important thing: always, I repeat, always let the replication finish its job, especially if the domain spreads across multiple sites. If not, the domain rename operation will fail and clients will not even be able to recognize the old domain. To verify everything is synchronized issue the following command:\n\n1 repadmin / showrepl\n\nIf no errors are showing you can move to the next step.\n\nNow is time to create a file, an XML file, that contains a description of the current forest structure and a list of all the domain partitions and application directory partitions in the forest. From the terminal issue the following command:\n\n1 rendom / list\n\nYou might get the message The Behavior version of the Forest is 0. It must be 2 or greater to perform a domain rename: The server is unwilling to process the request. :8245. This pops-up when the forest is not running at minimum 2003 functional level. I did this on purpose so in case you encounter the same situation, you know why. If the forest is at 2003 level the command succeeds.\n\nThe file is generated in the root of the C drive of the control station with the name Domainlist.xml. Open the file using Notepad or any other text editor and replace all the instances of the old domain name with the new one.\n\n\nSave the file and issue the bellow command to generate the domain",
      "Americans for Prosperity to gather in Manhattan on Thursday to 'stand up to these extremists who despise free enterprise'\n\nAn activist group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers is planning a rally in New York on Thursday to \"stand up to Occupy Wall Street extremists\".\n\nSPONSORED\n\nAmericans for Prosperity will gather at the Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan to demonstrate against Occupy protesters and Barack Obama's handling of the economy.\n\n\"The Occupy Wall Street crowd is nothing but a fringe element of malcontents bent on mayhem and destruction,\" said Steve Lonegan, Americans for Prosperity's New Jersey state director.\n\n\"These are people who despise free enterprise. They are not attacking Wall Street. They are attacking the very freedoms that everyday Americans cherish to pursue their own dreams and succeed.\"\n\nLonegan added that it was \"time that someone stood up to the Occupy Wall Street mob\".\n\nThe rally, announced on Wednesday, is part of Americans for Prosperity's \"Failing Agenda\" bus tour across the US. The non-profit organisation has three buses crossing the US, drawing attention to what it sees as Obama's failings on the economy.\n\nThe specific focus on Occupy Wall Street comes after the movement celebrated its first anniversary on Monday, although the occasion was marred by close to 200 arrests across New York.\n\nDavid and Charles Koch have poured money into Americans for Prosperity, which is tied to the Tea Party movement and has a focus on small government and low taxes.\n\nAlthough Americans for Prosperity says it \"does not expressly advocate for the success or defeat of any candidate for public office\", the organisation has run adverts targeting Obama. Mitt Romney attended a fundraiser held by the Kochs this summer.\n\nA spokesman for Americans for Prosperity would not predict how many people might attend the rally at the Rockefeller, but the group's website claims to be \"more than two million activists strong\" across the country. The group has chapters in 34 states, according to its press release. Attendees will listen to speeches from Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, Lonegan and others.\n\n\"What the American people are really worried about is President Obama's failing agenda,\" Lonegan said.\n\n\"They are worried about a failing agenda that is saddling future generations of Americans with trillions of dollars of debt and leaving them with a bleak future. They are worried about the economic destruction President Obama's policies have had on the economy and on job creation.\"\n\nBill Dobbs, an Occupy Wall Street activist who attended the movement's anniversary event on Monday, described the rally as \"an interesting development\".\n\n\"But the rich want almost everything, they'd like to take just about everything in sight,\" he said. \"The 1% must be getting desperate to put their supporters out on the street.\"\n\n© Guardian News and Media 2012",
      "Abstract\n\nImportance Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is the persistent inflammation of the sinus and nasal passages lasting over 3 months. The etiology of CRS is not well understood.\n\nObjective To obtain insights into the disease process, we contrasted the microbiome and immune response from patients with CRS and healthy controls.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants A case vs control design was used. Samples were collected in the operating room in an institutional hospital or clinic. Thirty patients with CRS and 12 healthy controls undergoing surgery were recruited.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures The microbiome was analyzed by deep sequencing of the bacterial 16S and fungal 18S ribosomal RNA genes. Immune response was measured by quantification of 30 different cytokines by multiplexed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immune cells in the lavage were identified by flow cytometry. The immune response of peripheral blood leukocytes to the lavage microbiota was assessed by interleukin (IL)-5 enzyme-linked immunospot assay.\n\nResults While quantitative increase in most bacterial and fungal species was observed in patients with CRS relative to controls, the microbiomes of patients with CRS were qualitatively similar to the controls. Because these results indicated that bacteria and fungi are not triggering CRS, we undertook a more detailed characterization of the immune response. Patients with CRS had increased levels of the following cytokines: IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, and IL-13, along with increased levels of eosinophils and basophils in the lavage. Importantly, peripheral blood leukocytes isolated from patients with CRS responded to control lavage samples (ie, to commensals) to produce IL-5. In contrast, the same lavage sample evoked no IL-5 production in leukocytes from healthy controls.\n\nConclusions and Relevance These findings support the theory that in some cases CRS results from an immune hyperresponsiveness to commensal organisms.\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is the persistent inflammation, lasting longer than 3 months, of the nasal and paranasal mucosa and is a challenging condition to treat, partly owing to its multifaceted, poorly understood pathophysiologic mechanisms.1,2 Treatment goals include establishing sinus ventilation and drainage, decreasing inflammation while improving tissue integrity, and limiting causative factors. While some patients recover with targeted antibiotic therapy, others exhibit a prolonged course resistant to medical treatment. Other cases are refractory even to surgical intervention directed toward providing open pathways for inspissated secretions to drain.3\n\nSeveral factors have been proposed as causes of CRS, including allergy, immune deficiency, cystic fibrosis, gastroesophageal reflux, and structural abnormalities. Attempts have been made to stratify CRS based on various clinical and pathologic features into subgroups4 including allergic fungal sinusitis,5 CRS with or without nasal polyps6 and with and without biofilms,7,8 eosinophilic CRS,9 and others. Owing in part to variability in culture techniques, there is little consensus regarding the microbiologic aspects and the role of various organisms in CRS. It has generally been viewed that bacterial infections in this group of patients is polymicrobial and more likely to involve gram-negative organisms.10 In this regard, bacterial superantigens have been implicated in binding to and activating T cells.11,12 The role of anaerobes is unclear.13 An \"infectious\" etiology, in the traditional sense, for most patients with CRS seems unlikely because of the striking ineffectiveness of antibiotics to resolve the symptoms for any appreciable period.\n\nMore recently, attention has turned to the role of fungi in this disease process. Ponikau et al14 used a novel culturing method to demonstrate the presence of fungi in 96% of the 210 patients with CRS examined. Several fungal species were identified: on average 2.2 fungal species per patient with CRS. In their patient population a few fungal species including Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Penicillium showed statistical differences between patients with CRS and controls. The survey of fungi has been repeated in patients with CRS in a number of countries using the polymerase chain reaction against the fungi with varying results.15-18 For these analyses, organism-specific primers for number of fungi identified by Ponikau et al14 were used, but consistently no statistical differences in the presence of fungi in patients with CRS and control samples were found.\n\nQuiz Ref IDMost of the studies evaluating host immune response in patients with CRS have identified an elevation of cytokines associated with a T helper (T H ) 2 response. In some patient subsets, predominantly in Asian populations, a T H 1 and T H 17 response has also been",

      "Thus far, 18 women have alleged that Bill Cosby, the former puddin' pop lovin' patriarch on the revered sitcom The Cosby Show, sexually assaulted them between 1967 and 2004. Renewed interest in the case(s) was sparked last month, when stand-up comedian Hannibal Buress accused Cosby of being \"a rapist\" in a charged rant during his Philadelphia comedy set.\n\nOne of the most vocal of the alleged sexual assault victims is Andrea Constand, then 31, who claimed that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her at his Pennsylvania mansion in 2004. Constand, a Canadian, reported the incident to the Durham, Ontario, police department, but no criminal charges were field against Cosby. The comedian did, however, settle a civil suit filed by Constand out of court that sought compensation for \"mental anguish,\" \"post-traumatic stress disorder,\" and the \"loss of enjoyment of life's pleasures.\"\n\nConstand's complaint, filed February 1, 2006, makes an interesting allegation: That Cosby granted an exclusive interview to The National Enquirer in 2005 in exchange for the publication killing a story they were planning on running of another woman coming out with her story of a sexual assault by Cosby.\n\nAccording to the 2006 complaint filed by Constand against The National Enquirer and Cosby's attorney, the inimitable Marty Singer, on February 21, 2005, Cosby deigned to grant an exclusive interview to The National Enquirer \"knowing it would injure Plaintiff, and to deprive her of her good name, credit and reputation.\" In said interview, Cosby allegedly conveyed \"either directly or by implication\" that Constand \"asked Cosby for money\" before going to the police, which in Cosby's eyes, represented a \"classic shakedown\" attempt. Constand claimed that the accusation was patently false, and demanded $150,000 in damages from the tabloid and attorney.\n\n\"I'm not saying that what I did was wrong, but I apologize to my loving wife, who has stood by my side for all these years,\" Cosby told The Enquirer. \"Sometimes you try to help people and it backfires. People can soil you by taking advantage… I am not going to give in to people who try to exploit me because of my celebrity status.\"\n\nBut Constand's 16-page complaint also details her alleged sexual assault at the hands of Cosby.\n\nAround December 2001, Constand alleges she was employed at Temple University as Director of Operations for the Women's Basketball program. She says she met Cosby, a Temple alumnus and big-time donor to the university, in November 2002.\n\nCosby allegedly \"fostered a friendship\" with Constand, and over time, \"she considered him to be both her friend, albeit older, and a mentor,\" according to the complaint. For over a year, she claims to have been friends with Cosby, discussing Temple women's basketball, having conversations on the phone, and being his guest at dinner parties and events hosted by Cosby.\n\nThen, in January 2004, Constand alleges Cosby invited her to his home in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, \"telling her that he wanted to offer assistance in her pursuit of a different career.\" Constand says she agreed to meet Cosby at his home at about 9 p.m., and during that fateful evening, Cosby \"drugged the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her.\"\n\nFurther details of the alleged sexual assault were outlined in a separate civil case, Constand v. Cosby, filed in Pennsylvania on June 2, 2005. That complaint alleged that \"defendant deceived plaintiff into ingesting a narcotic or other type of drug which caused plaintiff to become semi-conscious, and thereafter defendant sexually assaulted plaintiff.\" She hazily recalls Cosby allegedly touching her breasts and fondling her genitals, and that when she awoke, according to the complaint, she found her clothing scattered all over the floor and felt like she'd been violated.\n\nShe also contended that after reporting the allegations to the Durham police, Cosby and his reps \"knowingly made false statements to the media\" about Constand.\n\nNow, here's where things get tricky. In the 2005 case, Constand claimed to have 13 Jane Doe witnesses that would provide testimony against Cosby, and that those women \"should be protected from public disclosure,\" since there were \"important privacy concerns at issue in disclosing the Jane Doe witnesses' names and addresses to the media. In particular, the anticipated testimony of the Jane Doe witnesses relates details of alleged similar incidents of sexual assaults involving the defendant,\" claimed Constand, further arguing that disclosing the Jane Doe witnesses' identities \"may place the Jane Doe witnesses at risk of physical and psychological harm\" from \"overly zealous fans and supporters of the celebrity defendant.\" Ultimately, however, the court denied Constand's motion for a protective order to protect the identity of her Jane Doe witnesses.\n\nConstand's 2006 complaint delved further into how Cosby and his lawyer at the time, Marty Singer, allegedly smeared her",

      "Plans to legalise recreational marijuana in Canada have those south of the border worried they'll lose their lead in the emerging pot industry\n\nHe may be the chief executive of Denver's largest marijuana dispensary, ground zero for America's fastest growing industry, but Andy Williams struggles with a lot of financial hurdles.\n\nThe First Bank of Colorado closed the accounts of everyone in the family business, Medicine Man Technologies, including children who have no part in the industry. Williams can't take on any investment and needs to fund expansion through personal loans from friends and family.\n\n\nCustomers can only pay in cash; banks refuse to hold his money and everyone from employees to contractors need to accept cash payments. Employees, who can't prove their income as a result, often struggle to get loans and mortgages.\n\n\nFurthermore, section 280E of the US tax code prohibits the deduction of expenses related to controlled substances for tax purposes, and Williams predicts that he gives the internal revenue service an additional $600,000 each year as a result of business expenses that can't be written off.\n\n\nWhile recreational marijuana legalisation is well on its way in states like Colorado, it remains illegal at the federal level, stifling the growth and innovation of the industry's first movers.\n\n\nMeanwhile, north of the border, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has vowed to legalise recreational marijuana consumption on a federal level, opening the door to investment, less restrictive tax policies and banks that can treat the marijuana industry like any other. While legalisation hasn't yet taken place in Canada, when it inevitably does American marijuana businesses may suddenly find themselves at a disadvantage.\n\n\n\"They'll be first to market,\" says Williams. \"There's going to be a lot of development and innovation in Canada that's going to spur economic growth and attract investment. First to market is going to get a lot of attention, so it's a lost opportunity for the United States if and when that happens.\"\n\n\nWilliams believes that Canadian companies will eventually leapfrog the growth and development that's taken place in the US since legalisation began at the state level.\n\n\n\"The real setback will be longer term in their jump in developing that intellectual property, whether that's in producing marijuana or developing brands or discovering new uses for cannabis in the medical field,\" he said. \"It's the long-term effect of being behind the eight ball that I'm concerned about.\"\n\n\nRecreational marijuana is still illegal in Canada but many look to its medicinal marijuana system, which is considered among the best in the world, as a sign of things to come. Health Canada, the country's federal health authority, already regulates over one million square feet of approved marijuana production space spread across 30 industrial-sized facilities. Recent reports suggest that Canadian medical marijuana producers are currently storing a combined seven tonnes, a stash that continues to grow while the industry waits for federal prohibition to be repealed.\n\n\n\"We currently have the most industrialized process for marijuana production in the world,\" said Alan Gertner, the co-founder and CEO of Toronto-based high-end cannabis lifestyle brand, Tokyo Smoke. \"That puts us in a position where, with the repeal of marijuana prohibition at a national level, we can build significant infrastructure and build brands and build intellectual property at a pace that's unrivalled.\"\n\n\nGertner adds that while some states are well ahead of Canada in terms of recreational distribution, federal prohibition has left the industry in a less mature state, making it ripe for disruption by better-funded Canadian competitors.\n\n\n\"It doesn't at all feel like you're experiencing modern retail in the design of the store, in the layout of the store, in the staff of the store, in any part of the experience, and it's possible that almost overnight Canada could bring modern retail to the marijuana space [in the US],\" he said. \"The same is true with growing in the US. None of the growing facilities in the US feel like modern, industrial scale growing operations, whereas if you look at the medical marijuana program in Canada it's a modern program built for industrial scale.\"\n\n\nRecreational legalization in Canada, however, could force policymakers in the US to modernize their federal policies in order to level the playing field.\n\n\n\"If Canada does that they're going to be moving the needle on global policy, and that global policy will just apply more pressure to policy makers in the United States to make the right decisions,\" said Leslie Bocskor, the president of Electrum Partners, a Las Vegas-based cannabis advisory and services firm. \"We will be looking to our neighbours to the north and saying we need to be more like them, they've done the right thing by legalizing it on a federal basis, we need to look at how to achieve the same type of civilized, rational policy that Canada has, so I think it will be helpful. \"\n\n\nBocskor adds that with the medical and recreational marijuana industries predicted to reach a combined $40bn in the next five to",
      "BY RAUL HERNANDEZ, American Justice Notebook Reporter\n\nOXNARD, CALIFORNIA — The U.S. Justice Department is reviewing an ongoing internal investigation by the Oxnard Police Department surrounding allegations that the city's police officers put so-called shooting tattoos on their left shoulders after they were involved in shootings with a suspects, according to a spokesman for the department in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I can tell you that we are reviewing the matter. I will not comment on any specific allegations or any specific questions that you have posed. Also, I cannot give you a timetable as to how long our review will take,\" stated Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the Justice Department in an email sent Tuesday.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, Police Chief Jeri Williams said the investigation is ongoing, and she didn't know when it would conclude.\n\n\"I don't have a time frame right now but it is an ongoing investigation,\" said Williams.\n\nAmerican Justice also learned that the city of Oxnard has hired a San Francisco law firm to conduct an independent investigation surrounding the shooting-tattoo allegations.\n\nA former Oxnard police officer told American Justice Notebook said when gun smoke coming out of the barrel is added to the shooting tattoo, this indicats that the shooting was fatal.\n\nAs part of a settlement agreement involving the fatal shooting of a 21-year-old jogger in October 2012, the city also held a press conference Tuesday.\n\nThe press conference was held at the Oxnard Police Department by Chief Williams, Mayor Tim Flynn, Oxnard City Manager Greg Nyhoff and others. Williams and officials proclaimed Oct. 13 as \"Community Safety and Anti-Violence Day\" in honor of jogger Alfonso Limon Jr. who unwittingly walked into a running gun battle between a parolee and police in October 2012.\n\n\"Alfonso Limon Jr. was an innocent bystander who was tragically killed,\" Williams said. \"The Limon family lost a beloved son and brother and the lives of many other people including the Oxnard community have been forever changed.\"\n\nAdding, \"The officers who were involved in this incident are dedicated public servants. They too have been profoundly affected…'\"\n\n\"The use of deadly force is most serious act a police officer can take and it is the last thing an officer wants to experience during his or her career,\" Williams said.\n\nThe press conference and a memorial for Limon was part of the city's $6.7 million, wrongful death settlement. In addition, Williams announced that the settlement agreement calls for Oxnard officers to wear body-cameras within a year or so.\n\nLimon was shot between 16 to 21 times by four officers as he lay on the ground, Limon family lawyer Adam Shea had said at a press conference.\n\nThe shooting was captured on video and loaded onto YouTube.\n\nThe Ventura County District Attorney's Office reviewed the shooting of Limon and ruled that it was \"legally justified and not a criminal act.\"\n\nSome members of Limon's family along with their lawyers, Chad Prentice and Mark Flores, attended the press conference and later talked to the media.\n\nRebecca Limon, the older sister of the victim and family spokeswoman, said she is hopeful things will change with what she sees as a practice by Oxnard officers of terrorizing, harassing, brutalizing and intimidated residents, especially those who live in low-income communities such as La Colonia.\n\n\"They come into our community, and they assume that anyone who is out must being doing something wrong,\" said Limon.\n\nOutside the Police Department, members of Todo Poder al Pueblo Collective also held a press conference renewing demands that Oxnard create civilian police review board and hold police officers for shootings.\n\n\"Officers who kill or treat our community unjustly don't belong in our streets or in our schools – they belong in a jail cell,\" said group spokeswoman and member Daniela Garcia.\n\nThe group plans to hold a march Sunday in Oxnard to commemorate the second-anniversary of the Limon shooting.\n\nSan Francisco Law Firm Investigation\n\nLinn Malaspino-Badel, an investigator with the law firm of Renne Sloan Holtzman and Sakai, told American Justice that they were recently hired by the city, not the police department, to conduct the investigation. She said they wanted to talk to the former Oxnard officer who gave American Justice the information, asking that her number be passed on to the officer.\n\nMalaspino-Badel said his name will not show up in any report or shared with the Oxnard Police Department.\n\n\"He will be treated like a confidential informant,\" she said.\n\nThe former Oxnard officer requested that his name not be used in these stories because he was afraid of retaliation.\n\nThe former Oxnard police officer who recently left the department said he saw the tattoos",

AlertNIH notifies employees across many communication devices – cell phone, home phone, work phone, smart phone or email. Please visit http://alert.nih.gov for more information or to sign up.\n\nHow does \"Lockdown\" differ from \"Shelter-in-Place\"?\n\nAs published in the NIH Emergency Preparedness Procedures flip guide: \"Lockdowns protect employees from a threat from an armed person, inside or outside the building, in instances where it may be more dangerous to leave the building by directed evacuation than to stay in a secured room.\" Shelter-In-Place is defined as \"SIP will used when it is safer for employees to remain inside the building rather than to evacuate. Interior windowless rooms can be used for SIP. Examples of SIP incidents include tornado warnings and HAZMAT incidents.\" If you would like copies of the NIH Emergency Preparedness Procedures flip book delivered to your office, please call 301-496-1985.\n\n\nWhat is the best recommendation to ensure staff \"Shelter-in-Place\" during a \"Lockdown\"?\n\nEffective execution of any plan depends on training. Many resources are available and the Division of Emergency Management can be contacted at (301) 496-1985 to conduct in-house training exercises.\n\n\nWhat is a \"Partial Release\"?\n\nA partial release can be used by the Incident Commander to release people in unaffected portions of the campus. A Partial Lockdown only applies to NIH facilities off the NIH-Campus. A Partial Lockdown secures the most external points of entry (gates, building entrances, office suite doors, etc.) for a facility and restricts entry and exit movements to and from the facility or NIH area of a facility. Once a Partial Lockdown is declared, no one, including NIH personnel, are allowed to enter the facility. However, NIH personnel may leave the facility at their own risk. Normal activities within the building continue as much as possible. Instructions would be provided via AlertNIH.\n\n\nHow Should \"Run, Hide, Fight\" be used?\n\nFrom the NIH Emergency Preparedness Procedures flip guide: \"While escape is typically the response of choice to an armed intruder inside a building, this action should only be considered if it is absolutely safe to do so, without coming in contact with the intruder. Run: If escaping, exit the building as quickly as possible, seek safe cover outside, and call the Police immediately. If safe escape is not possible the \"lockdown\" is the best option.\" Hide: inside or outside, be aware of your surroundings. Find a location that can be secured. Lock the door(s) if possible and barricade the door with furniture or heavy objects such as a filing cabinet. Fight: The last option. If you are confronted by the shooter, fight aggressively with any weapons you have available, your life may depend on the ferocity of your attack. Each individual must maintain situational awareness and make the choice in the moment that best suits the situation.\n\nIf you would like copies of the NIH Emergency Preparedness Procedures flip book delivered to your office, or need to coordinate training, please call (301) 496-1985.",

      "Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservatives are on the rise in B.C., according to two polls released Wednesday.\n\nIn late August the polling firm Insights West, in a poll of more than 800 British Columbians, indicated Tory popularity had fallen by more than half from the 2011 election, when the party got 45 per cent of the vote.\n\nThat poll had the NDP at a commanding 41 per cent, compared to 24 per cent for the Liberals, 22 per cent for the Conservatives, and 12 per cent for the Green party.\n\nBut that poll was quickly contradicted by some national polls which, using smaller and therefore less reliable sample sizes for B.C., suggested that the race to win most of B.C.'s 42 seats is much tighter.\n\nAnd Wednesday's new Insights West online survey of 1,003 British Columbians, conducted Sept. 18-21, confirms that there is a tight three-way race in the province.\n\nThe NDP still leads at 34 per cent, while the Conservatives are second at 28 per cent, the Liberals third with 26 per cent, while the Greens are at 11.\n\nBut the NDP's lead may be more precarious than the numbers indicate, since that party is particularly popular with young British Columbians, while the Conservatives are the top choice for residents over age 55.\n\nStudies have shown that older Canadians are far more likely to vote than youth.\n\n\"The Conservatives have definitely improved their standing in British Columbia and their voters remain extremely committed,\" Insights West pollster Mario Canseco said in a news release.\n\nAs for approval ratings, the NDP's Tom Mulcair is in the lead at 60 per cent, up five points from August, while Elizabeth May is at 53 per cent, Justin Trudeau is at 51 per cent, and Harper 32 per cent.\n\nInsights West says a poll of this size has an error margin of 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. However, many pollsters refuse to publish error margins for online polls, since the respondents – while weighted to reflect B.C.'s demography – aren't chosen randomly.\n\nMeanwhile, an organization encouraging Canadians to vote strategically to oust Harper on Oct. 19 has released polling data for 31 targeted ridings, including six in B.C.\n\nThe polling data supports other national polls suggesting the Conservatives are edging upwards in popular support, though are still at risk of losing a number of key ridings that voted Tory in 2011.\n\nIn 11 ridings that were also polled in August, the Conservatives are up by several percentage points in nine and down by only a single point – or much less than the margin of error – in just two, one of which was Vancouver Granville.\n\nLeadnow raised money to hire the Environics polling firm to use interactive voice response technology (that is, a recorded voice asking the respondent to push buttons) involving an average of 605 voting-age Canadians in each of the ridings Sept 18-21.\n\nThat kind of sampling results in a margin of error of around four percentage points, 19 times out of 20, according to Environics.",
      "Colin Kaepernick, the African-American quarterback with the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers, has arguably been the number one story intertwining sports and politics since late August. His sitting down, followed by taking a knee to protest the playing of the national anthem before NFL games, has helped to elevate mass consciousness on the systematic racism in the capitalist system, especially police violence heaped upon Black and Brown people. His courageous act of kneeling, week after week, has encouraged others, especially Black and Brown youth, many of them athletes in all kinds of sports, to also protest police brutality and other forms of racist violence.\n\nKaepernick sponsored a \"Know Your Rights\" conference in Oakland, Calif., on Sept. 29 for at least 100 Black and Brown youth. They discussed and issued a 10-point program, modeled on the Black Panther Party program, to help empower youth, including knowing their legal rights when confronted by police.\n\nFocus on main message: 'Fight police brutality'\n\nKaepernick has expressed solidarity on Twitter with Indigenous nations leading the heroic struggle against the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline in Standing Rock, N.D., and for an Indigenous Peoples' Day, not \"Thanksgiving.\"\n\nWhile Kaepernick has gained millions of admirers, he has also been viciously attacked by neoliberals and right-wingers of every stripe for the form and content of protest he has taken. Some have even stated that the protest has gone on too long and that he should cease, which he has refused to do.\n\nAnd now the vitriolic nature of attacks against Kaepernick has reached an even higher crescendo over recent remarks he made about former Cuban President Fidel Castro before and after his death.\n\nIn response to a shirt that Kaepernick wore in early September showing a meeting of Fidel Castro and Malcolm X in Harlem in 1960, a Cuban-American reporter with the Miami Herald, Armando Salguero, asked Kaepernick during a Nov. 23 press conference before the 49ers played the Miami Dolphins why he wore the shirt.\n\nKaepernick first responded that Malcolm X is a hero of his and he supported his ideology. When Salguero stridently asked him why wear a shirt with Fidel, Kaepernick stated calmly that Malcolm was always a person open to new ideas, one of the traits he admired most about him. He also stated that \"Castro did help create a highest literacy rate because [Cuba invests] more in their educational system than they do in their prison system, which we do not do here [United States] even though we're fully capable of doing that.\" When Salguero went on to say that Castro \"divided Cuban families,\" Kaepernick retorted that mass incarceration in the U.S. divides families.\n\nAt a Nov. 27 press conference, the same reporter asked Kaepernick if he felt the same way about Castro upon his death. Kaepernick repeated some of the points he had made earlier: \"What I said was I agree with the investment in education. I also agree with the investment in free universal health care, as well as the involvement in helping end apartheid in South Africa. … I said I support the investment in education… .\" (USA Today, Nov. 28)\n\nDid Kaepernick utter the words \"socialism\" or \"revolution\" to praise Fidel Castro? No, and it didn't matter because even the mildest of positive or negative comments about Fidel Castro did not stop the most contemptible, outrageous attacks on a professional football player who has dared to take on white supremacy in his own unique way.\n\nIt proves again that a high-profile athlete like Kaepernick has the influence to help bring about more awareness by connecting institutionalized racism at home to U.S. foreign policy abroad, which is a threat to the political stability of the capitalist class and its apologists.\n\nMichael Smith, a co-host of ESPN's \"His and Hers,\" stated on Nov. 28 that any attacks on Kaepernick's remarks on Fidel Castro should not be used to distract attention from his main message — fighting police brutality.",

      "Ancient underground city in İzmit excites archaeology world\n\nISTANBUL\n\nWork to unearth the remains of an ancient city, discovered in northwestern Turkey during the removal of debris after the massive Marmara earthquake of August 1999, are due to begin in April.During works to remove the debris of collapsed buildings after the earthquake, a number of historical artifacts were found underground in the İzmit province's Çukurbağ district. Later on sculptures, building blocks and column stones were also found during construction works in the earthquake zone.Among them was a giant headless sculpture of Heracles, which is now on display at İzmit's Ethnography Museum. This very important piece was treated as garbage by the buildings' owners, who threw it away out of fear that the construction would be halted. After being informed about the sculpture, however, İzmit Museum officials took the sculpture under protection.A headless and legless Athena sculpture and a panel featuring the Roman emperors Diocletian and Konstantin embracing each other were also among the findings.Officials then realized the existence very close to the surface of a huge palace-like structure, an ancient underground theater, and huge tunnels that extend as far as the İzmit Gulf.Following these discoveries, the İzmit Provincial Cultural Directorate surrounded the region with wire fences and took it under 24-hour protection with private security guards.Speaking ahead of the start of excavations, İzmit Museum Directorate head Rıdvan Gölcük said many Turkish and foreign archaeologists and researchers had applied to them to be involved in the works. Gölcük added that a large meeting would be held this month on the excavations.\"The Heracles statue was found in 2001 in Çukurbağ. Then a short-term excavation was carried out in the neighborhood. Following the expropriation process, further excavations were carried out in the same place in 2009 and unique artifacts were found. Among these artifacts, the panel of the Roman emperors was very important. It was made after the Romans won a victory against a Gothic invasion,\" he said.\"Geo-radar work will be carried out in this field for the first time to determine the underground cultural artifacts there. We will start excavations in April. There is a massive monumental structure here and the archaeology world is very curious about it. The excavations will be headed by the Kocaeli Museum under the consultancy of Tuna Şare and his team from the Kocaeli University. This project is also supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [TÜBİTAK],\" Gölcük added.The Foundation for the Protection and Promotion of the Environment and Cultural Heritage's (ÇEKÜL) Kocali representative, Numan Gülşah, said houses had been built on this area of the Roman Palace, while the underground structure covered a huge area of 60,000 square meters.Gülşah, who is also the head of the Nicomedia Academy Association, said İzmit was named Nicomedia in the ancient era and was the capital of Rome from 284 to 330. The palace there was built by Diocletian.\"My family has lived in this area for 300 years, but I had to leave my damaged home after it was damaged during the Marmara earthquake. We don't live there anymore ... But many people living here are unaware that they have been living on a huge palace for centuries,\" he said.",
      "Warning: This post contains a major spoiler about tonight's Game of Thrones: \"The Dance of Dragons\"\n\nThis may have been the darkest hour yet on Game of Thrones. Sunday's episode of HBO's fantasy hit concluded with a murder so disturbing and stomach twisting, it's arguably one of the most horrifying sequences yet by the international sensation that's made an artful blood sport of shocking its fans.\n\nMidway through Sunday's episode \"The Dance of Dragons,\" Stannis Baratheon, his military campaign failing as his troops froze in the snow, sacrificed his daughter Shireen in a last-ditch effort to change his fate. At the urging of his mistress, Stannis ordered the young teen burned alive. Shireen's walk to the funeral pyre, her dawning realization of what was occurring, and her mother's too-late change of heart, was devastating for fans, who earlier this season swooned over a scene where the typically stoic Stannis reassured his daughter of his love.\n\nGame of Thrones showrunner Dan Weiss spoke to EW about the sequence, and how it ties the show's exploration of fanaticism. \"Horrible things happening to people in this show, and this is one that we thought was entirely [narratively] justified,\" Weiss said. \"It was set-up by the predicament that Stannis was in. It will be awful to see, but it's supposed to be awful.\"\n\nWhen I asked Weiss the question that fans surely have tonight: \"How could you do that to Shireen?\" Weiss philosophically noted you could \"flip that question\" into a larger debate about how we're all highly selective about which characters deserve our empathy. Stannis has been burning people alive for seemingly trivial reasons since season 2, yet we've still tended to regard him as a great leader—at least, by Westeros standards.\n\n\"It's like a two-tiered system,\" he noted. \"If a superhero knocks over a building and there are 5,000 people in the building that we can presume are now dead, does it matter? Because they're not people we know. But if one dog we like gets run over by a car, it's the worst thing we've we've ever seen. I totally understand where that visceral reaction comes from. I have that same reaction. There's also something shitty about that. So instead of saying, 'How could you do this to somebody you know and care about?' maybe when it's happening to somebody we don't know so well, maybe then it should hit us all a bit harder.\"\n\nWhich is exactly the sort of morality questions that Thrones so often stimulates. Like after the brutal Red Wedding season 3, Tywin Lannister asked whether killing a wedding party of characters we love was wrong if by doing so it ends a war and saves thousands of anonymous lives?\n\nOn HBO's behind-the-scenes video (below), fellow showrunner David Benioff added that A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin told producers about this twist (suggesting this Shireen's death will happen in an upcoming book, as well). \"It was one of those moments where I remember looking at Dan and [thinking] that's so horrible and so good in a story sense,\" Benioff said. \"The very first time we saw Stannis and Melisandre, they were burning people alive on the beaches of Dragonstone and it's really all come to this. There's been so much talk of king's blood, and the power of king's blood, and it all leads ultimately, fatally, to Shireen's sacrifice, and it's one of the most horrible moments we've shot … It's obviously the hardest choice he's ever made in his life and for Stannis it comes down to ambition versus familial love and for Stannis and for Stannis sadly that choice is ambition.\"\n\nWeiss also added that religious fanaticism in Stannis' camp adds another level to the Shireen murder, one that could provides some insight into our own world.\n\n\"People who watch Game of Thrones don't see the same world as Stannis and Melisandre,\" Weiss said. \"To those characters, magic is real and it works. That's something fun about this genre because when magic is real and you can see it with your own eyes in the show, it gives you a window into the heads of people who believe irrational things on faith. I can't really get my head around how those people operate in our world, as they're so completely disconnected from the way I process the world. So in a strange way, fantasy is a cock-eyed window into the heads of people who would do something terrible for an irrational reason.\"\n\nEW's deep-dive recap for \"The Dance of Dragons\" and the Thrones team talks about that epic fighting pit scene.\n\nFor more, HBO's behind the scenes video gives some insight into the scene as well:",
      "Avijit Roy's wife, demanding justice, has said officers 'stood close by and did not act' while she and her husband were brutally attacked\n\nBangladesh seeking police 'black sheep' on duty when US blogger was killed\n\nAtheist blogger Avijit Roy 'was not just a person … he was a movement' Read more\n\nA government adviser on Saturday asked the chief of Bangladesh police to identify the officers who failed to act when Avijit Roy, an atheist American blogger, was attacked and killed last month in Dhaka.\n\n\"Identify the black sheep among the force and bring them under law and justice to uphold your image,\" said HT Imam, political adviser to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nImam directed the remarks to Shahidul Hoque, the inspector general of Bangladesh police, while addressing a meeting at Dhaka University on the perception of police.\n\nIt was at the university that Roy, an engineer of Bangladeshi origin, was killed by machete-wielding assailants as he and his wife were returning from a book fair last month. His wife, Rafida Bonya Ahmed, suffered head injuries and lost a finger. She later returned to the US for treatment.\n\n\"While Avijit and I were being ruthlessly attacked, the local police stood close by and did not act,\" Rafida told Reuters on Tuesday. \"Now, we demand that the Bangladeshi government do everything in its power to bring the murderers to justice.\"\n\nHoque, the chief of police, told the meeting the allegations were under investigation. He also said the university campus will now be covered by closed circuit television.\n\nAvijit Roy was hacked to death for his secular views. Let's share his story | Alom Shaha Read more\n\nOn Saturday, a court allowed one suspect in the killing, Farabi Shafiur Rahman, to be remanded in custody for another five days. He had already been held for 10 days, during which time he denied killing Avijit but said he was glad the blogger was attacked.\n\nRahman had previously been jailed for his ties to the extremist Hizbut Tahrir Islamist group.\n\nAvijit's killing follows a string of attacks on secular bloggers in recent years in the Muslim-majority nation. Media group Reporters Without Borders rated Bangladesh 146th among 180 countries in a ranking of press freedom last year.\n\nRafida urged the government to \"stop a legal culture of impunity, where writers can be killed without the killers being brought to trial\".",

It will be at a ceremony for Vital Voices, a women's leadership group she founded.\n\nShe's also slated to deliver this year's commencement address at her alma mater Wellesley College. Her public schedule is sending a signal, perhaps, that she plans to remain involved in the issues she holds dear, reports CBS News correspondent Jan Crawford.\n\nThe former senator and secretary of state accepted an award Tuesday for her work advocating for women.\n\n\"I've had my ups and my downs. In the last months, I've done my share of sleeping. A little soul searching and reflecting,\" Clinton said.\n\nLongtime friend Mack McLarty said Clinton is working on a new book while pondering her next move.\n\n\"No one ever said that Hillary Clinton doesn't have resilience, grit,\" McLarty said.\n\nMcLarty served as chief of staff for Clinton's husband. He said one of Clinton's top moments was also her toughest – her concession speech.\n\n\"This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I'm sorry that we did not win this election,\" Clinton had said.\n\n\"I think all of us, most Americans, and most people around the world, admire and recognize when someone is dealing with adversity with strength and courage and faith,\" McLarty said.\n\nClinton has remained largely out of sight, though social media posts have captured her hiking in the woods, going shopping, dining out and catching some Broadway shows.\n\n\nRecent runners-up have handled their presidential defeats in different ways. John Kerry in 2004 and John McCain in 2008 continued their work as U.S. senators. After the 2012 race, Mitt Romney went back into business, re-emerging four years later as a contender for Mr. Trump's secretary of state.\n\nAl Gore reinvented himself after the 2000 campaign. His documentary, \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" won an Oscar, and his environmental efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\"I think that that does speak to the fact that there are other chapters, there are other opportunities out there,\" Washington Post national political correspondent Karen Tumulty said.\n\nBut she said the opportunity has likely passed for the Clintons to remain a dominant force in their party.\n\n\"In some ways, people see them as a roadblock,\" Tumulty said. \"A lot of Democrats would like to see the Clintons move aside and give some oxygen for some new voices to emerge.\"\n\nThat said, Chelsea Clinton has recently spoken out. Since the election, she's sent a number of feisty political tweets. This week she described the president's immigration policy as \"disturbing\" and suggested the Republican health care plan is \"not moral.\"",

      "By Adam Jourdan\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA.N) said sales topped 10 billion yuan ($1.51 billion) in just over three minutes from the opening of Singles' Day, an annual online discount sales gala that has become the world's biggest shopping spree.\n\nOnce a celebration for China's lonely hearts, Singles' Day has become a 24-hour extravaganza that outsells Black Friday and Cyber Monday U.S. sales combined, and acts as a barometer for China's consumers.\n\nAfter a star-studded event in Shanghai late on Friday counted down to the sale's midnight start, Alibaba said gross merchandise volume (GMV) topped 10 billion yuan in a little over three minutes, and had almost doubled, to 19.1 billion yuan, in under six minutes - beating the entire day's sales in 2012.\n\nAlibaba alone saw $17.7 billion of goods sold on its platform at last year's Singles' Day.\n\nThe event gets shoppers around China scouting for bargains and loading up their online shopping carts, while delivery men - and robots - are braced for an estimated 1.5 billion parcels expected over the next six days.\n\n\"This is a big event for China, for the Chinese economy,\" co-founder and Alibaba vice chairman Joseph Tsai said ahead of the sales bonanza. \"On Singles' Day, shopping is a sport, it's entertainment.\"\n\nJack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba Group, and actor Nicole Kidman attend a show during Alibaba Group's 11.11 Singles' Day global shopping festival in Shanghai, China, November 10, 2017.

Spending rose by nearly a third at 2016's sale - the eighth iteration of the event - but that was slower than the 60 percent increase logged in 2015.\n\nAt Alibaba's Friday night gala, co-founder and chairman Jack Ma hosted guests including actress Nicole Kidman, singer Pharrell Williams and Chinese musicians and film stars such as Zhang Ziyi and Fan Bingbing.\n\nSLOWER GROWTH\n\nThe excitement around the shopping blitz, however, masks the challenges facing China's online retailers such as Alibaba and JD.com Inc (JD.O), which are having to spend more to compete for shoppers in a broader economy where growth is slowing.\n\n\"A lot of the lower hanging fruit has been picked and there's increased competition for a share of consumer spending,\" said Matthew Crabbe, Asia Pacific research director at Mintel.\n\nHe estimated Alibaba's Singles' Day sales growth would likely slow to around 20 percent. Online retailers were being forced to push offline as well as overseas to attract new shoppers, and the overall online retail market was close to \"saturation\".\n\n\"They're having to spill over out of the purely online realm into the wider consumer market,\" Crabbe said.\n\nThis has sparked deals to buy bricks-and-mortar stores in China, and overseas tie-ups especially in Southeast Asia. Technology, too, has been key, with virtual reality dressing rooms and live fashion shows to attract shoppers to haute couture.\n\nJack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba Group, attends a show during Alibaba Group's 11.11 Singles' Day global shopping festival in Shanghai, China, November 10, 2017.

      "WISHING for his death \"in a fiery car accident\" was only one of many messages directed at Chuck Henson when he became the University of Missouri's new interim vice-chancellor for inclusion, diversity and equity. Mr Henson does not follow social media, but his wife does. Recently she agreed to stop reading the death threats and other missives intended for her husband, and instead to help him focus on his task, which is to end the racial turmoil that has made the university the centre of a nationwide campus protest movement over race for the past three months.\n\n\"We have a unique history and we have a unique problem,\" says Mr Henson, a law professor. Missouri was a slave state until 1865; its first public university was founded in 1839 by James Rollins, an owner of slaves. It first admitted black students only in 1950 (Yale's first black student graduated in 1857, Harvard's in 1870). The relations of African-Americans both with other students, and with the overwhelmingly white faculty, have frequently been uneasy. Anger boiled over in November, leading to the resignation of Tim Wolfe, the university's president and chancellor, after weeks of protests by students outraged by what they saw as Mr Wolfe's failure to deal with racism on campus.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nOffensive incidents last year included a swastika smeared with faeces on the wall of a dormitory bathroom and racial epithets hurled at black students, including Payton Head, the president of the student body. Cynthia Frisby, a member of faculty, recounted in a Facebook post how, when jogging along a road, a white man in a lorry flying the Confederate flag stopped, spat at her, delivered racist abuse, gave her the finger and drove off. \"I have been called the N-word too many times to count\", she wrote, including, she says, by other members of faculty. The student protests gained momentum when Jonathan Butler, a graduate student, staged a hunger strike to force Mr Wolfe to resign. Yet the turning point was the announcement by members of the football team that they would not play or practise and boycott a game against Brigham Young University (BYU) unless Mr Wolfe stepped down. The footballers' boycott of the game would have cost the university around $1m.\n\nMr Wolfe was replaced as president of the university, temporarily, by Michael Middleton, a long-standing member of the law faculty and graduate of the university, who founded its Legion of Black Collegians in 1968. Mr Middleton promises to meet all the demands of \"Concerned Student 1950\", the group of black students leading the protests, which include the creation of a \"comprehensive racial awareness and inclusion curriculum\" and an increase in black members of faculty to 10% from around 3%. Mr Middleton cautions, however, that some demands will be tricky to meet by the deadline the student group proposes, adding that he will explain why.\n\nMr Middleton insists that racism at the University of Missouri, nicknamed Mizzou, is no worse than at other big universities. He calls the often inadvertent \"micro-aggressions\" against minority students a \"national problem\" that is embedded in American history, and adds: \"We are the first in finding effective solutions.\" So far that has meant a clean-out of the university's leadership. Seven temporary officials, in addition to Mr Middleton, are now running the university, including Mr Henson and Hank Foley, Mizzou's new interim chancellor.\n\nYet while the university is making changes, the student protests have also set off a different kind of reaction. Kurt Bahr, a Republican state representative, says some of his constituents have told him that they regret attending Mizzou and do not want their children to go there, because they do not trust the new leadership of the university. One of his constituents even said that he feared for the safety of his daughter on campus thanks to the \"instability\" there.\n\nMr Bahr co-sponsored a bill in December that would strip scholarships from any athlete who \"calls, incites, supports or participates in any strike\", and would require colleges and universities to fine coaching staff who encourage them. The bill has been withdrawn since because its author, Rick Brattin, another Republican state lawmaker, realised that the state could not mandate the revocation of privately funded athletic scholarships such as the football scholarships at Mizzou. But Mr Bahr insists that the proposed bill \"made its point\", which is that a strike is not a good way to cope with a possible systemic problem. \"Are we promoting anarchy within our university system?\" he asks.\n\nThe backlash against the changes at Mizzou is likely to continue, led by self-styled defenders of the First Amendment (which protects free speech). Yet the First Amendment does not give people a free pass to go round saying hateful things, points out Mr Henson. To",
      "Water scarcity in Nevada highlights the moral dilemma of whether it is more important to sustain the viability of large cities or rural areas\n\nOn World Water Day last month, Nevada's state engineer approved the Southern Nevada Water Authority's plans to claim around 84,000 acre feet of groundwater in two rural counties. White Pine and Lincoln counties have a combined population of 15,000, but are far richer in groundwater than parched metropolitan Las Vegas to the south. The region of 2 million people could run out of water in 20 years if alternative sources of water are not found.\n\nThis 21st century water conflict is an example of how thirsty cities and rural areas can clash over the rights to a precious resource. There is a distinct moral dilemma to this dispute over whether it is more critical to ensure the viability of large economies like Las Vegas, or to maintain the way of life of towns like Baker, a hamlet of 150 people where families have tended to the same land for generations.\n\nLas Vegas was one of the cities hit hardest by the US foreclosure crisis, but there are signs that the economy is on the mend. New hotels and attractions keep opening, its convention business is competitive and the city is a haven for small and medium-sized businesses who relocate from high-tax states like California. Residents benefit from low housing prices, access to a spectacular outdoor lifestyle, and a libertarian political culture that is conducive to individuals who want to do their own thing. Information technology and health care industries are diversifying the local economy, providing more of a macroeconomic buffer from the dominant hospitality and gaming industries' susceptibility to fluctuations in the business climate. Sustainable businesses are now taking root as well.\n\nThe region is becoming a test bed for clean energy technologies, including solar, wind and geothermal. Green building projects are also on the rise, including the CityCenter complex on the Las Vegas Strip. The local US Green Building Council boasts various LEED certified projects that emphasise huge achievements in water savings.\n\nBut if Las Vegas' economy is to thrive in the future, the city must take a hard look at its water usage. An increase in sustainable building practices, with a focus on water stewardship, would be a start. While resorts do their part to conserve water, the myriad of artificial lakes, fountains and swimming pools give the impression that water is being wasted extravagantly. The resorts counter that the greatest usage of water on their properties is from air conditioning, a necessity in the summer to keep visitors comfortable in the searing summer heat that can soar over 40 degrees. The avoidance of a future water catastrophe will rely on cooperation between businesses, residents and local government.\n\nSo far cooperation between businesses and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA), responsible for meeting Las Vegas' water needs, is off to a slow start. The SNWA offers businesses as much as £190,000 for replacing grass with more water-efficient landscaping. Rebates for the installation of water efficient technologies are also on the table. Coupons are available to residents for devices such as pool covers and rain sensors.\n\nDespite this, during my recent visit to Las Vegas and stay at the Aria, part of the LEED gold certified CityCenter complex, it was hard to tell that Sin City was anywhere near a water crisis. Guests are prompted to do little but leave their towels on the rail if they are happy to reuse them. In fairness, for the hospitality sector, Las Vegas' most important economic generator, the riddle is a tough one to solve.\n\nHow does an industry encourage its customers and employees to focus on water conservation when most visitors view travel for business or pleasure as an opportunity to behave differently than they would at home? If businesses cannot do more, why should residents? And if Las Vegas cannot find a way to drastically reduce its water consumption, is it smart for the city to drain water away from the rest of the state? After all, the ranchers and farmers in rural Nevada play a key role in feeding the city's residents and visitors. The diversion of water from rural areas could replace one problem with another.\n\nLeon Kaye is founder and editor of GreenGoPost.com\n\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Ammonium nitrate may also have been present.\n\nChinese officials, though, have admitted there are discrepancies between accounts from the company and from customs, and that damage to company offices had made it hard to identify the chemicals.\n\nMore than 200 chemical and biological experts from the military are on site but officials insist that the air and water quality levels in Tianjin are safe.\n\nPeople's Daily said the Tianjin facility, operated by Ruihai Logistics, had \"clearly violated\" safety rules that say dangerous materials must be stored at least 1km (0.6 mile) away from public buildings and main roads.\n\nState media said the manager of the Ruihai Logistics site had been detained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dashboard camera captures China blast shockwave\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aerial views of the site of the explosion in Tianjin\n\nWater factor?\n\nFire officials have defended the actions of the team who responded to the initial report of a fire on Wednesday night, amid suggestions that using water on some of the chemicals could have led to the blasts.\n\nCalcium carbide reacts with water to create the highly explosive acetylene.\n\nFire department official Lei Jinde said: \"We knew there was calcium carbide inside but we didn't know whether it had already exploded. At that point no-one knew, it wasn't that the firefighters were stupid.\"\n\nThey would not have sprayed water on calcium carbide, he said, although he admitted it was a large warehouse and the team could not be sure where that substance was.\n\nChemical experts suggest an acetylene blast could then have detonated ammonium nitrate causing a much larger blast.\n\nThere were two explosions.

Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2006. 336 pp. $24.95 (paper), ISBN 978-0-8078-5722-9.\n\nReviewed by Anna Marta Holian (Department of History, Arizona State University)\n\nPublished on H-German (April, 2009)\n\nCommissioned by Susan R. Boettcher\n\n\nThe Pleasures and Pitfalls of Memory Studies\n\n\"Memory\" has by now become a central concept of historical scholarship, with numerous articles and books on memory, commemoration, and coming to terms with the past appearing regularly. Yet many questions still remain to be addressed about the nature of memory and how its study contributes to our knowledge of the past. Following up on a volume of essays edited with Peter Fritzsche, Alon Confino's new book addresses these issues.[1] A collection of essays written between 1993 and 2004, it circles around the intertwined themes of memory, history, and national belonging in modern Germany. The essays are in themselves diverse. Some are best characterized as thought pieces on theory and method, while others are built around the author's archival research. Many are a combination of these two genres.\n\nThe book is divided into two parts. In part 1, Confino examines the idea of Heimat in Germany from national unification to 1990. The focus here, as in his book on the Heimat movement in imperial Germany, falls on the relationship between the local and the national.[2] Taking issue with the idea that the development of nationalism and the nation-state subsumed and even obliterated local identities, Confino examines how ideas of localness informed and structured nationhood. The concept of Heimat plays a key role here. He suggests that Heimat is best understood not as an ideology, but as a flexible and malleable \"historical mentality\" (p. 28) adaptable to different political contexts. Each of the essays in this section explores these themes from a different vantage point.\n\nIn chapter 1, Confino examines the construction of a collective image of the German nation in the period between 1871 and 1914. His objective here is to examine the transformations in self-understanding that occurred over the period, such that in August 1914, Germans from across the empire \"marched united in the name of the nation\" (p. 31). He argues that the concept of Heimatallowed Germans to reconcile their local histories and the history of the larger German nation. He traces the development of a \"generic\" concept of Heimat applicable to all the localities in Germany. This concept signaled the success of a nationalizing project that included regional differences as components of an overarching national entity.\n\nChapter 2 examines the representation of Heimat in Edgar Reitz's 1980s made-for-TV miniseries of the same name. Here Confino uses the Heimat idea as a means of understanding the popularity of Reitz's film. As he notes, a great deal of discussion about the film has centered around its \"sins of omission,\" notably the minor attention paid to the Second World War and the Holocaust. While Confino agrees with such critiques, he also thinks they fail to capture what made the film so compelling. Reitz, Confino argues, drew on the symbolic authority of the Heimat idea, \"sanctifying memory and experience as modes of connecting with the past, while assuming a dismissive attitude towards history\" (p. 58). His approach dovetailed with larger cultural trends that identified memory as a more \"authentic\" means of representing the past.\n\nIn chapters 3 and 4, Confino explores the Heimat idea in West and East Germany, respectively. The concept of Heimat, he argues, provided West Germans with a means of talking about national identity at a time when expressions of nationalism were deemed suspect. Focusing on travel literature, he examines the representation of the Heimat as an innocent victim of the Nazi regime. At the same time, the Heimat idea could also be destabilizing. The existence of East Germany and of German refugees from Eastern Europe suggested \"a homeland whose boundaries were unstable and unclear\" (p. 87). In East Germany, on the other hand, one might have expected the Heimat idea to go the way of other concepts associated with the bourgeoisie and National Socialism. However, the flexibility of the idea allowed it to be adapted to the purpose of building a socialist state. Examining a set of East German election posters, Conf",

      "The besieged Syrian town of Daraya, a rebel-held suburb of Damascus where President Bashar al-Assad has refused to allow aid to starving Syrians, got its first U.N. aid convoy since 2012 on Wednesday.\n\nRussia's Defence Ministry said it had coordinated a 48-hour local ceasefire, a \"regime of calm\", with the Syrian authorities and with the United States \"to secure delivery of humanitarian aid to the population\".\n\nSyrian opposition negotiator Basma Kodmani said the aid to Daraya and nearby Mouadamiya, another besieged zone, was only a first step that had come about as a result of extreme international pressure on the Syrian government, and substantial\n\nchange was still needed.\n\n\"The first lesson is that pressure and ultimatums are the only way we get the regime to hear anything,\" she said. \"We will obviously not be content with one convoy as happened today.\"\n\nThe trucks got through on the day when the Syrian government faced a deadline to admit aid by road or risk having air drops imposed by the countries of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), which includes Syria's ally Russia.\n\n\"If we don't see substantial change, then we definitely are waiting for those air drops to happen as a sign of the seriousness and the commitment of the international community,\" Kodmani said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Syria's government had \"cynically allowed limited amounts of aid\" into the two besieged areas but failed to deliver the widespread humanitarian access called for by the international community.\n\n\"While air drops are complex, costly and risky, they are now the last resort to relieve human suffering across many besieged areas,\" he said in a statement. \"Countries with influence over the Assad regime such as Russia and Iran must now ensure that\n\nthese air operations can proceed in a safe and secure manner.\"\n\nThe aid to Daraya contained medical supplies, vaccines, baby milk and nutrition items, but no food.\n\nJakob Kern, the World Food Programme director in Syria, said the government had not allowed food in the first delivery, but another convoy with food was planned for Friday, and he expected the fighting would be suspended again to allow that aid in.\n\nThe United Nations has previously warned that children could die of starvation because of the \"horrendously critical\" situation in Daraya, Mouadamiya, and a third area, al Waer, which did not receive any aid on Wednesday.\n\nKern said there was some movement on food for al Waer, but he did not yet have details. He said it was too soon to say if there was an overall breakthrough on aid access.\n\nThe U.N. estimates 4,000 civilians are still in Daraya, which is close to a large air base and has been besieged and regularly bombed since 2012.\n\nSome 45,000 people are in Mouadamiya , but government employees are now allowed to go in and out and the siege is \"partially over\", with a local truce, Kern said.\n\nStaffan de Mistura, the U.N. mediator of Syria peace talks, has said he wants to see improved humanitarian access, as well as a renewed lull in the fighting, before announcing a date for a new round of peace talks in Geneva.\n\nThe ISSG humanitarian taskforce will meet on Thursday to review progress on getting aid to more than a million needy people in besieged and hard-to-reach areas. Kodmani said they should not be fooled by the Syrian government allowing in one convoy \"to defuse the pressure\".\n\n\"If it is going to become tit-for-tat, a convoy for a date, this is not going to work,\" she said.\n\nA return to peace talks, after a last round which ended on April 28 amid a spiral of violence, was likely if the international community kept up the pressure on Assad's\n\ngovernment, she said.\n\nThe opposition High Negotiations Committee has proposed a nationwide truce during the month of Ramadan, which would restore the \"cessation of hostilities\" that prevailed for two months from the end of February.\n\n(REUTERS)\n\nDate created : 2016-06-01",

He said it was a small way to honor the president\n\nHe has discovered and named more than 30 new species in the past.\n\nBut Platt typically named them after people he knew personally - his father-in-law, his doctorate adviser and other people he had 'a great deal of respect for'.\n\nNaming his latest discovery after Obama was a 'small way' of honoring him, Platt, who is a distant relative of the president, said Thursday.\n\nPlatt said Baracktrema obamai reminds him of the president because it's 'long, thin and cool as hell'.\n\nSome people pay thousands of dollars for the privilege of having a species named after them, Platt added.\n\nParasites live in and get nutrients from host animals. Baracktrema obamai 'are phenomenally incredibly resilient organisms' according to Platt.\n\n'I hold them in awe and with phenomenal respect,' Platt said.\n\nThe worm is related, distantly, to a parasite that can cause a devastating disease in humans, but it causes no harm to turtles.\n\nParasites are crucial to life and all around us, according to Rutgers biologist Michael Sukhedo, editor of the Journal of Parasitology, where the study appears.\n\nAbout seven out of 10 animals on Earth are parasites.\n\nNaming a new species - especially in the final paper of a career - 'is a big decision,' Sukhedo said.\n\nObama already has a spider, a fish and even an extinct lizard named after him.\n\nAlthough names are usually bestowed as an honor, Sukhedo admits once or twice parasites have been named as a tool of revenge — something Platt said isn't the case here.\n\nOne time, Sukhedo said, a biologist named an entire group of parasites after her ex-husband: microphallus.",
      "Update: Lincoln High students leave class Wednesday morning\n\nPortland teens forced school board members to publicly explain why they are delaying a bond to fix their crumbling, overcrowded high school by threatening a sit-in at Tuesday's board meeting.\n\nThe Lincoln High School students, who were about 30-strong at the meeting, want the board to put a $750 million construction bond on November's ballot. The deadline to place measures on that ballot is Thursday.\n\nThe board voted 4-3 against November at Tuesday's meeting after a tense debate, during which the board chair called the public push for November \"tone deaf' and Lincoln High School senior Michael Ioffe calmly, but pointedly, challenged board members' statements.\n\nUndeterred, the students now plan to walk out of class Wednesday morning and not come back unless the board agrees to hold an emergency meeting about the bond before Thursday's deadline.\n\nIt was a spectacle that could have been mistaken for a pep rally. Cheers. Boos. Teens sporting face paint and school colors as they held handmade signs.\n\nBut the victory the Lincoln High School students seek is unconventional school spirit. They want working toilets and clean water. They would like tiles with asbestos to stop falling from the ceiling. They would like to stop having to attend class in a nearby church because there isn't enough room in their actual school.\n\n\"We have more kids than chairs,\" Katie Swigart, 16, told The Oregonian/OregonLive.\n\nJust getting board members talking was a win for students. Until Tuesday, board members hadn't publicly taken up pleas from parents, students and even principals expressing alarm about the bond delay.\n\nUntil late July, the school board, advised by parents, builders and others, had proceeded with plans to advance a $750 million bond this fall to remake Lincoln, Benson and Madison high schools and refresh and make safe Kellogg Middle School so it can reopen as needed.\n\nBut at the July meeting where the board was expected to vote on placing the bond on November's ballot, school board vice chair Amy Kohnstamm announced plans push off the bond until May 2017 due to the recent lead scandal. She had the support of every board member but Mike Rosen, who expressed confusion as to how the board's course had changed so radically over a few days and asked, to no avail, for more debate.\n\nTuesday's meeting followed a holiday weekend filled with passionate email exchanges after parents and activists sent a letter pleading with board members to reconsider a November vote.\n\nThe letter claimed the board's confidential polling showed a May bond was doomed.\n\nEven with board members pushing for the bond to be brought up at Tuesday's meeting in light of the letter, it took a student protest to force discussion.\n\nWhat ensued was the exposure of a divided board. Board chair Tom Koehler, Pam Knowles, Steve Buel and Kohnstamm held firm for May 2017. Rosen, Julie Esparza Brown and Paul Anthony came out in support of November.\n\n\"I don't feel like we right now as a district are stable enough to be going out to our community and asking them to trust us,\" said Knowles, who among her concerns listed a crowded ballot.\n\nKoehler appeared visibly exasperated as he explained the plan had been November -- until a lead scandal ousted the superintendent in July and revealed a slew of hazards that the district hasn't even finished cataloging.\n\n\"We don't even know with the lead situation where the problem is. It could be in the connection between the city and the schools. We don't know that! That's a fundamental question,\" Koehler said, referencing recent revelations of a district-wide problem with lead tainted water. \"The world is not going to end tomorrow. We have time to do this and we have time to do this right and we will.\"\n\nIoffe pushed the board to consider a community session before Thursday's deadline, but was unsuccessful. Ioffe said he didn't understand how board members could cite a lack of community trust as a reason to delay the bond while also refusing requests from the community for public debate.\n\n\"This was an opportunity to rebuild trust. They blew an opportunity. There is no guarantee [Portland Public Schools] will rebuild trust by May,\" Ioffe said. \"I'm extremely disappointed. It seemed to me they weren't actually listening to our arguments, they weren't actually listening to community voices.\"\n\nIt wasn't the only logic students found hard to accept.\n\n\"It's just ridiculous that the school board can continually push things off,\" Maia Abbruzzese, 17, told The Oregonian/OregonLive after the meeting. \"Our teachers don't push off their deadlines for our assignments because they know that if they keep pushing it off it is never going to get done -- yet for some reason the school board is not held to the same standard of sticking to the",

      "Scott Simon's bio on the NPR website describes him as \"one of America's most admired writers and broadcasters,\" and it's tough to argue with that. As a Peabody-winning journalist with decades of experience, Simon's credentials are unimpeachable, and as the Saturday host of Weekend Edition, he regularly shows himself to be all the things you want a radio host to be: thoughtful, avuncular, well-informed, and above all, smart.\n\nSimon also has one and a quarter million followers on Twitter, and last Thursday morning, he asked them this:\n\nNow, you may have had this very thought, after watching someone on a bike blow through a red light, try and lane split through moving traffic, or do something similarly irresponsible. As Simon points out in a follow-up tweet, it happens all the time.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that no matter how egregious their behavior was, the three people he observed don't indicate that \"cyclists consider themselves above the law,\" any more than a pair of jaywalkers prove that pedestrians are morally opposed to crosswalks. It also takes the very broad problem of traffic violations and limits it to a single minority, ignoring the millions of car and truck drivers who flout the law every day, not to mention those scofflaw pedestrians.\n\nWhat Simon did in this pair of tweets was overgeneralize about a large group based on the behavior of a few members, and then tie that group to another member with a lot of bad press—two demonizing tactics that've been employed pretty much forever, to attack groups ranging from corporate lawyers to Asian drivers to welfare recipients.\n\nNumerous replies pointed out as much, the most entertaining coming from author Eben Weiss, who writes a popular long-running blog out of New York City called BikeSnob:\n\nThe rest of the exchange consisted of sympathetic followers favoriting and retweeting Simon's posts, others responding in passionate agreement, and dozens more drawing attention to its obvious fallacy (in a generally civil tone—Weiss' snarky retort was about as combative as it got). Simon followed up several more times over the course of the day, appearing at first defensive, then dismissive, and finally a bit chastened and almost conciliatory.\n\nNow, there's nothing unusual about this kind of bikers vs everyone drama, especially on the Internet: browse the comments section beneath a bike-related article on almost any broad-reaching publication, and you'll find that few topics besides Israel, healthcare and gun control stir up as much debate.\n\nWhat's remarkable is that Simon should've known better. An experienced reporter with a sterling reputation for fairness, he's one of the last people you'd expect to engage in this sort of stereotyping. And yet something made it OK for him to veer from fact into conjecture when talking about some people riding their bikes, in a way that would've been unimaginable in describing a professional, economic, ethnic or gender group.\n\nAfter 15 million miles traveled, the Citibike program has still caused not a single fatality for either pedestrians or riders.\n\nThis exception is something I stumble across regularly though, in the media and in everyday life. Delia Ephron, the celebrated screenwriter of \"You've Got Mail\" and producer of \"Sleepless in Seattle\" was so perturbed by New York's new Citibike bikeshare system last October that she wrote a 1000-word opinion piece for the New York Times, complaining that \"these bicycles have made walking around the city much scarier.\" It's a bold statement, completely at odds with the evidence—as of last month, after 15 million miles traveled, the Citibike program has still caused not a single fatality for either pedestrians or riders, and fewer than 30 serious injuries, while helping to improve the overall safety of the city's streets.\n\nA similar bikeshare system has been proposed here in Portland, but was vocally opposed in 2011 by city commissioner Amanda Fritz, who cited the \"unsafe behavior\" of existing cyclists as a reason to avoid anything that might put more of them on the streets.\n\nEven my mom has gotten in on the act, complaining several times of the menace that bicyclists pose to the citizens of Santa Barbara, where she lives. As evidence, she described once witnessing a pack of seven men on bikes, speeding down Alameda Padre Serra at 30mph in the dark, and being struck with terror, despite the fact that hundreds of cars travel that same stretch of road day and night at 35 or 40, posing a vastly greater threat.\n\nIn each of these cases, a thoughtful, intelligent observer is prodded by a mix of fear and anger to give an alarming anecdote more weight than an abundance of evidence, or even common sense. On a street carrying thousands of 3000 pound vehicles a day at 40mph or more, we focus our fears on the handful of 30 pound vehicles",

      "Your expectations, more than anything else in life, determine your reality. When it comes to achieving your goals, if you don't believe you'll succeed, you won't.\n\nResearch from LSU shows that people who believe in themselves use more metacognitive functions than those who don't. This means that they use more of their brains and have more brainpower to solve problems. Metacognition is especially important for achievement as it ensures that you approach problems from many different angles and adapt your approach as needed.\n\nThe tricky thing about your expectations is that they impact other people too. As far back as the 1960s, Harvard research demonstrated the power of our beliefs in swaying other people's behavior. When teachers in the studies were told that certain (randomly selected) children were smart, those kids performed better, not only in the classroom, but also on standardized IQ tests.\n\nIndeed, we get the most out of other people when we believe in them. Research shows that this happens because when we believe in someone,\n\nwe treat them better than people we think will fail,\n\nwe give them more opportunities to succeed than we give those we think will fail,\n\nwe give them more accurate, helpful feedback than we give others, and\n\nwe do more teaching because we believe it's time well spent.\n\nLetting your doubts cloud your belief in someone (or something) practically ensures their failure. Medical professionals call this the \"nocebo\" effect. Patients who have low expectations for medical procedures or treatments tend to have poorer results than those who expect success, even with regards to well-established treatments. If a doctor uses a treatment with a clinically verified high rate of success but presents it in a negative light, the probability of a negative outcome increases.\n\nYour expectations shape your reality. They can change your life, emotionally and physically. You need to be extra careful about (and aware of) the expectations you harbor as the wrong ones make life unnecessarily difficult. Be especially wary of the expectations that follow--they give people all kinds of trouble.\n\n1. Life should be fair. We've all been told a million times (and likely told other people) that life isn't fair, but in spite of what we know about the intricacies of injustice, it's a concept that doesn't quite sink in in practice. A surprising number of us subconsciously expect life to be fair, and we believe that any unfairness that we experience will somehow be balanced out, even if we don't do anything about it. If you're stuck in that mindset, it's time to get over it. When something \"unfair\" happens, don't rely on outside forces to get you back on your feet. Sometimes there isn't any consolation prize, and the sooner you stop expecting there to be, the sooner you can take actions that will actually make a difference.\n\n2. Opportunities will fall into my lap. One of the most important things a person can do is stick his or her neck out and seek opportunity. Just because you deserve a raise, a promotion, or a company car, doesn't mean it's going to happen. You have to make it happen. You have to put in the hard work, then go and get what's yours. If we limit ourselves to what's given to us, we are at the mercy of other people. When you take action, think \"what steps do I need to take?\" \"what obstacles are in my way and what do I need to do to remove them?\" and \"what mistakes am I making that take me away from my goals rather than toward them?\"\n\n3. Everyone should like me. People have hang ups, and that means all sorts of decent, kind, respectable people are not liked by (some) others, for no good reason at all. When you think that everyone should like you, you end up with hurt feelings when you shouldn't (you can't win them all). When you assume that people are going to like you, you take shortcuts; you start making requests and demands before you've laid the groundwork to really understand what the other person is thinking and feeling. Instead of expecting that people will like you, focus on earning their trust and respect.\n\n4. People should agree with me. This one can be tough. Sure, you know what you're talking about, and for that reason, people should take you seriously, but expecting people to agree with you out of courtesy or because your ideas are so incredibly sound is another story. Something that's obvious to you might not be so to someone with different experiences and a different agenda, so stop being offended when people disagree with you, and stop assuming that there is only one right answer (yours). Instead, focus on how you can find solutions that give everyone what they need.\n\n5. People know what I'm trying to say. People can't read your mind, and what you're trying to say is rarely what other people hear. You can't expect",

But you'd be wrong.\n\nShockingly, Germany has agreed with 13 other European Union nations to label goods made in factories owned by Jews in Judea and Samaria.\n\nWhy the labels, you ask? It's to harm Jewish businesses that dare to locate on ground disputed by Palestinian groups, which, despite their repeated rejections of peace overtures and terrorist attacks on Israelis, will not suffer the same negative labeling.\n\nSo German consumers, like others in the EU, can now eat food and buy goods that are \"Judenrein\" — free of Jewish taint — one of the Third Reich's grand dreams.\n\nAs Michael Freund pointed out in the Jerusalem Post, \"It should be obvious that treating merchandise differently simply because the person who owns the factory where it was made is a follower of Moses rather than Muhammad is an act of pure bigotry.\"\n\nBigotry, yes. But it should also be clear a nation that once required yellow stars to be sewn on the clothing of Jews so they could be easily identified and discriminated against would be a bit more sensitive to religious labeling. Apparently not.\n\nSadly, Germany has joined the rest of the EU in this craziness. Europe's bizarre fixation with blaming Jews for the world's ills is an ugly stain on that civilization that never fades — no matter how hard it's scrubbed.\n\nThose of a certain age will recall that the persecution of the Jews in 1930s Nazi Germany began with the slogan \"Kauft nicht bei Juden\" — roughly, \"Don't buy from Jews.\" Today, echoes of that hateful sentiment are being heard again in German homes and streets.\n\nYes, Jewish settlements and businesses in what's called the West Bank are a sore spot for Arabs — and for some Europeans. But that area will inevitably be subject to negotiation as part of a two-state settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.\n\nSo why should Europe try to force the hand of one side but not the other?\n\nWhile we wish this madness were confined to Europe, in truth it is happening here, too. The so-called \"BDS\" movement — for \"Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions\" — has swept the nation's universities in recent months, with a number of schools actually voting on whether to cut economic ties to Israel. Some in the BDS movement are pushing Wall Street to do the same.\n\nAmericans should know: BDS is a vile anti-Semitic movement, pushed by far-left groups and Islamist extremists.\n\nIt's bad enough Europe's supposedly sophisticated elites have swallowed this creed of hate whole. But it has no place in American society.",

I love these on sandwiches, the flavour is a bit tangy yet sweet and low-acid. 30 seeds\n\n\n-Grown by Annapolis Seeds\n\n\nLiving up to its name, Beauty King produces big 6\" beefsteak tomatoes, coloured with red stripes on a yellow base. Marbled interior when you cut one open! Developed by Wild Boar Farms. 30 seeds\n\n\n-Grown in Nictaux, NS by Annapolis Seeds\n\n\nOne of the most colourfully striped tomatoes we've ever grown, with green and red and orange and yellow and streaked and blended together. Marbled flesh too! Enormous and lumpy fruit, 6\" across is pretty normal. The flavourful dense flesh is great for slicing and can't be beat for sauce. Developed by Wild Boar Farm. 30 seeds\n\n\n-Grown in Nictaux, NS by Annapolis Seeds\n\n\nA personal favourite! This large red beefsteak produces tons of delicious meaty fruit on 3-4 foot vines.

Family heirloom from Sicily. 30 seed s\n\n\n-Grown in by Annapolis Seeds\n\n\nA top quality slicer, producing huge, red, lumpy, and very flavourful fruit. Developed in the 1930s by M.C. \"Radiator Charlie\" Byles. When his radiator business slumped during the depression he turned to plant breeding. After word spread about this tomato he sold the seedlings for $1.00 a piece, paying off his mortgage in the process. 30 seeds\n\n-Grown in Nictaux, NS by Annapolis Seeds\n\n\nThese huge pink fruit are right up there with the best tasting tomatoes.

Usually the consensus favourite beefsteak among tasters at Tomato Fest. 4' plants. 20 seeds, limited supply\n\n\n-Grown by Annapolis Seeds",
      "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nLeigh Corfman, who alleged earlier this month that Roy Moore sexually abused her nearly 40 years ago when she was a 14-year-old girl, said Monday that she \"didn't deserve to have a 32-year-old man prey upon\" her.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with NBC's TODAY— her first on television since she made her allegations against the embattled GOP Senate candidate in Alabama — Corfman, now 53, said she was simply a \"14-year-old child playing in an adult's world,\" when Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her.\n\n\"I was expecting candlelight and roses, what I got was very different,\" she said. \"I felt guilty. I felt like I was the one to blame. It was decades before I was able to let that go.\"\n\n\"I was a 14-year-old child trying to play in an adult's world and he was 32 years old,\" she said.\n\nCorfman told The Washington Post earlier this month that in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore took off her \"shirt and pants and removed his clothes,\" touched her \"over her bra and underpants\" and \"guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.\" At least eight other women have come forward with accusations against Moore. Moore has repeatedly denied all of the allegations and said they were the product of nefarious efforts by his political opponents and the media.\n\nRelated: At Sunday services, Alabama voters mostly quiet on Moore\n\n\"I am not guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone,\" Moore said earlier this month, a message his campaign has put out repeatedly.\n\nCorfman, however, maintained Monday that the Post \"sought me out,\" \"that she's \"voted as a Republican for years and years\" and that \"this isn't political for me.\"\n\nAnd she dismissed Moore's denials of sexual misconduct with anyone, saying, \"I wonder how many 'me's' he doesn't know.\"\n\nWhen asked why she waited until now to come forward with the allegations, she explained that she had told people after the incident occurred — \"my family knew, family friends knew,\" she said — but that she wanted to protect her young children from the maelstrom she knew would follow.\n\n\"My children were small, I was a single parent,\" she said, expressing a desire to shield them from the fallout.\n\nFormer Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore waits to speak at a news conference, Thursday in Birmingham, Ala. Brynn Anderson / AP\n\nBut when the Post contacted her, she told them, that, \"If they found additional people, I would tell my story.\"\n\n\"I didn't go looking for this, it fell in my lap,\" she said of deciding to make her story public.\n\nRelated: How Roy Moore may flip deep-red Alabama to blue\n\nIn fact, the Post also interviewed three other women who claim Moore \"pursued\" them when they were 16 to 18 and when he was in his early 30s, and following Corfman's allegations, several other women have come forward with similar allegations.\n\nCorfman denied receiving any compensation for telling her story, saying that, \"if anything, this has cost me.\"\n\nCorfman said Monday that she is \"looking forward to being an advocate for people like me\" and that she's already seen positive results from having told her story.\n\n\"I've had a lot of people that have come out and have said that because of my courage that they're able to do the same,\" she said.\n\nThe report in the Post, which came before the state's Dec. 12 special Senate election, has sent Moore's campaign into turmoil, with a growing number of Republican lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., urging Moore to drop out of the race. Moore, in turn, has accused McConnell of trying to \"steal the election from the people of Alabama.\" President Donald Trump initially said Moore should step aside in the race if the allegations are true, but has since remained silent on the issue.\n\nRelated: Moore scandal ignites fundraising explosion for Democratic challenger\n\nIn her interview Monday, Corfman provided additional details about her encounters with Moore decades ago.\n\n\"I met him around the corner from my house, my mother did not know and he took me to his home,\" Corfman said Monday. \"After arriving at his home on the second occasion that I went with him he basically laid out some blankets on the floor of his living room and proceeded to…seduce me, I guess you would say.\"\n\nThe Post originally reported that the relationship between Moore and Corfman began in 1979, when he approached her and her mother outside a courtroom in rural Alabama and offered to watch",
      "I'm being applauded for taking parental leave, yet my partner – also a scientist – faces the usual obstacles for her maternity leave.\n\nLast autumn, I started my research lab at the University of Cambridge's Stem Cell Institute, but this coming summer I'm doing something completely different – I'm taking parental leave with my first child. I must admit that at least some inspiration came from my brother, who took a term off with his second child and said it was one of the best decisions he'd ever made.\n\nIt's been a tough journey to get a group leader position – 11 years of intense research-focused time, most of which were spent in a complete black hole of uncertainty with respect to my future career. And now, I won't be in the lab for 14 weeks – we'll see how it all works out.\n\nReaction to my decision amongst non-academic family and friends was pretty much universally positive, but reaction from academic colleagues was highly variable – a substantial number of whom think I'm absolutely crazy to take off so much time within the first year of my research lab's existence. I wasn't too surprised by this, having emerged from the North American system where parental leave is much less generous than in Europe. What I didn't expect were the other reactions …\n\nIn November, I was at a national cancer conference and at one of the evening receptions I spoke with a female scientist from another U.K. university about women in science. Over the course of the discussion, I mentioned that my partner and I would be taking advantage of the U.K.'s new \"Shared Parental Leave\" policy, with my partner taking 8.5 months of leave and me taking 3.5 months. She said she was shocked and surprised that a brand new group leader would take the time off, but also said \"good for you.\"\n\nThe next evening is when things really hit home though. After the conference dinner I was on the dance floor and a complete stranger came up to me and asked, \"Are you David Kent?\" I assumed she had seen my presentation earlier in the day until she continued, \"the David Kent who is taking parental leave as a new group leader? I just wanted to say thank you.\" We chatted a little and it was as simple as this: a male group leader taking parental leave was just not that common, especially not a 3.5-month block of time. The professor from the other night had clearly gone off and told her colleagues and word had spread.\n\nHere I was being showered with praise for taking 3.5 months off work and feeling pretty good about my decision until I did a quick comparison to my partner's situation, also an early career scientist. Not only would she be taking nearly three times the amount of leave, but she's also been carrying a baby around for eight months whilst undertaking world-class research. Is there a small fan club of approving academics lined up to congratulate her on the brave decision to spend time with her child? Not that I've seen.\n\nSo, in effect, my taking a short block of parental leave has boosted my profile in the eyes of some academics and her taking a longer block will put her in the challenging position that so many young female academics find themselves in: trying to play catch-up and pretend that children haven't impacted their careers (many do not acknowledge children on CVs, job applications, etc., for fear of being viewed unfavourably). The science community needs to embrace rather than shun such individuals.\n\nOverall, if universities want more women in science, then the way we handle babies and families needs to change – men need to be as \"risky\" to hire as women. But change does not come overnight and it does not come easy. As a start, more countries (and institutions) need to have \"use it or lose it\" policies, such as exists in Quebec – the father is given a block of time that the mother cannot use. Universities and individuals need to fight for this. Countries such as Sweden have seen incredible results from such policies and are amongst the world leaders in having women in senior positions. For science specifically, granting agencies need to behave like the European Research Council with respect to eligibility windows and like EMBO for postdoctoral fellowships – creating small allowances for young parents that make the journey just a little bit easier.\n\nOr perhaps we should just force them all out of science – that seems to be the way things are currently set up and it makes me worry for our future science workforce.",
      "As I write this, there's no doubt countless Zelda fans are enjoying the open-world brilliance of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You don't need to even play the game to see that its making its place in gaming history, with a large number of gaming publications giving it scores of 9 and 10. But before this game hit the shelves, there was only really one other Zelda title that made as much noise. The true pioneer of the 3D action-adventure, it revolutionary lock-on targeting system, its excellent combat and puzzle-solving…there could only be one game that fits the description. That game, my friends, is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\n\nIt's crazy to think that, just over two decades ago when it was released in 1998, that this was the very first 3D Zelda title. We may have become accustomed to seeing our green-garbed hero, Link, in three-dimensions now, but it was unimaginable back then. Before Ocarina of Time, the previous major Zelda was A Link to the Past, yet another 2D top-down adventure that garnered almost universal acclaim and a commercial success. If poorly done, Ocarina of Time could have been a cringe-worthy moment in the franchise's life. Fortunately for us, this was far from the case and Nintendo truly outdid themselves here.\n\nThe game was revolutionary in how it combined so many elements in one 3D package; adventuring, combat, puzzle-solving, and horseback riding. The adventuring, in particular, was helped by the then-impressive presentation – cinematic graphics that showcased a diverse fantasy world, with some of the most iconic music in gaming. The moment when you first step out onto Hyrule Field, you hear its grandiose melody and realise that the in-game world is your oyster is one you're likely not to forget.\n\nUltimately it was OoT's impressive set pieces that made up for what is essentially a simple plotline. As Link, you must stop the evil king, Ganondorf from taking over Hyrule. Aside from small twists along the way, that is essentially the crux of the tale. But the simplicity of the plot can be excused simply because of a) the wonderful characters, Princess Zelda et al and b) the aforementioned setpieces.\n\nThis game is the first to give Zelda an actual personality. In previous games, she was just your stereotypical wise maiden who was an object to be saved by our elf-like hero. Here, Zelda is a far more endearing character who is a mischievous, naive young child at the start, but a responsible and knowing badass adult by the game's end. This brings me then to the set pieces. One of the coolest setpieces of the game is Link's transition from a young child to a growing adult. As a kid, watching Link become conscious as an adult after the time skip was one of the best things ever – and still is. Not only do we see a slightly different Hyrule than before, but this newly grown-up character can use a different set of items than his younger self, adding some variety to the gameplay. Then there is the famous horseback riding where adult Link can travel across Hyrule with his trusty steed, Epona. There are so many elements to this game that I could go on forever. I could, but I won't. Even if I would love to do so!\n\nSince the game was re-released and given a graphical overhaul in 2013 on the 3DS, there is now a whole new generation of gamers experiencing the game's majesty. Just like I grew up playing the re-release on the GameCube and was completely spellbound from beginning to end, so will many others in the years to come.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",
      "Here we go again 🙂\n\nOriginally launched 2 years ago, the strip format was challenging but ultimately limiting. I was also writing in a descriptive, expository style. Which is cool, except it's not terribly exciting for me. So I changed the writing style to be more personal.\n\nThis time completing the page took a couple of weeks. One of evening of rescripting & thumbnailing, then working on the art whenever I could.\n\nThe crazy part is that I like the page. I like the end result. It's not perfect (ask any artist and they will point out every single flaw in their own art) but I like it.

Also\n\nLEAVE A COMMENT!\n\nWe creators like to know that we're not doing this in a vacuum 🙂\n\nHere's the original post:\n\nWhew. Finishing this first strip took well over a month. It shouldn't have taken that long but I procrastinated. Putting yourself out there is kinda scary – but now it's done & there's no going back.\n\nThe comic itself has been floating around in my head as one of those ideas that appear one day and stubbornly refuse to leave. I don't recall specifically when but I have to credit 3 creators for undoubtedly kicking off the idea somewhere in my subconscious:\n\nScott McCloud for Understanding Comics, who showed that explaining things can be fun & interesting\n\nMarjane Satrapi for Persepolis, in whose story I recognized some of the same societal & familial situations (though without the major political and social upheavels she & her family went through)\n\nGene Yang for American Born Chinese, for taking on stereotypes, race & identity in such an engaging fashion\n\nI wanted to note that much of my comic will deal with memories, which are fickle things. Some of my memories will be completely true and some of them will focus on that one aspect that flared and drowned everything else out. I'm curious to explore which ones stuck in my head and why. (I'm also not averse to imagining what happened ;))\n\nI don't have anything planned in advance – I'm just going to explore my memories and see where they lead. Or go a little Scott McCloud-y and try to explain Indian things that get lost in translation. And deep down, it may be a quest for identity too. We'll see where it all leads.",

Hopefully you will never need to manage a severe injury like this one. If you have any questions regarding this topic or suggestions for future newsletters please let us know.\n\nCharlene & Catherine\n\nJust about any fence is safe…until it isn't!Here in the middle Georgia area we have have had record breaking drought and heat. While the heat and lack of rain has made life miserable, we also need to think about how this may impact our horses, especially our pastures. Here at CGES, we are seeing an increasing number of leg injuries from fences. This is likely due to the saying, \"the grass is always greener on the other side\"! No rain means no grass and horses are still trying to graze on our now non-existent pastures, they are looking elsewhere for green sources…outside the fence.Injury can occur with any type of fencing, but we see the most severe injuries with wire fencing. Horses will lean or push against the fence trying to get at grass. As they realize they can get further and further, they begin to try and step through the fence. But horses don't seem to understand the concept of picking the foot back up to release the leg and then they are trapped. Once trapped, the horse panics and starts pulling or running until the fence breaks or the horse gives up. This is when the biggest injury occurs. The wire acts like a knife on their skin, muscle and tendons-leading to very large, unsightly wounds.You may have slick wire, electric wire, barbwire, wood, vinyl, coated electric, hog wire, no climb wire, or many other alternatives of fence. But here are a few things to keep in mind with your fence, whatever type it may be, to try and prevent these injuries from occurring.- Horses have to be able to see the fence at all times. Brightness and contrast from the surrounding landscape makes the fence more visible. If the fence line is overgrown with brush it is much harder to see. Pieces of cloth or colored tape are very helpful with this, the movement and color difference makes the fence much more visible.- It is best if fence lines are not shared. Horses will fight among fence lines if enticed, which commonly leads to injuries. Having an alley or some degree of separation between paddocks and pastures is ideal.- Group horses together who are known to get along. If new horses arrive, place them with a horse that usually gets along with others in the safest fencing you have available. Horses being turned out in a new pasture for the first time should be turned out early in the daylight so they can learn the landscape. Lower class horses will run through fences",
      "@Kirk You didn't have to watch that video for me, so I'm not going to be more or less happy if you decided to watch it or not. But he is not some random YouTuber. There are literally thousands of people on YouTube making their own videos about Nintendo and/or NX, and there's only a few that actually take the time to put some thought into what they are saying and are trying to make well informed videos that contain enough information to back up their statements.\n\nAlthough he might be a bit too \"American\" for your taste, PlayerEssence is one of these people, and so is SuperMetalDave64, StudioQ so that is why I only watch those channels for my Nintendo speculation needs.\n\nWant crazy, clueless and useless? Go watch OBE1Plays or King Avery Games...\n\nAnd then there are some people on Twitter like HappyNintendoFan really doing some hardcore detective work on the topic.\n\nAnd then I of course also have a mind of my own and I just decided to give it a go and see what I could dig up through my own contacts, and I have to say that I was actually surprised at how far I got, and in the coming week, some more contacts will be added through people I already know, so that will either bring additional information or will confirm what I now know. And what I've learned so far, honestly does come across as multiple systems, dedicated devices.\n\nAnd why would Nintendo hire two separate marketing leads for handheld and console, if NX is going to be one device?\n\nIf I as a marketing professional would HAVE to make that idea fit, then that would mean that they are going to market a single device in two completely separate ways, and that makes no sense at all, at least not in this universe...\n\nMake of that what you will.\n\nAnd IGN means nothing to me. Even as an American, I think they are a sensationalist, highly biased site, and it is certainly not beneath them to misreport on stuff, regardless of the fact that there might be some good people working there. Only a couple of years ago, they were very anti-Nintendo, and they have flip-flopped between the other two quite a bit, so I do not take much of what they say seriously. Their reviews often differ wildly from other big sites, regardless of what game on what system they are reviewing. Could be good, could be bad, but sticking out like a sore thumb nine out of ten times isn't really positive in my book. And who are these sources then? Why aren't they revealed? Because they could be wrong, possibly? If something is verified and double-checked, then these sources could be revealed, or at the very least hinted at without calling them out directly. Just saying \"well, I have a friend who's friend is a developer for Nintendo and they told me this so it is true, but I'm not going to tell you who he is.\" should hold no water in any sane person's book...\n\nI do have to wonder though, why you seem to think (even besides the whole EuroGamer rumor) that NX being a handheld is the best thing logically, or is that just a personal wish you have?\n\nYour concept sounds great in some ways, and you seem to have put a lot of thought into it, but if you think from a company's perspective, you would have to think of ALL your potential customers, and going by the latest numbers (even if they aren't all that great) there are at least 13 million people worldwide that would rather buy a dedicated home console instead of a beefed up handheld, and you can't just dismiss that audience by saying: \"well, we are just going to make this one device, so take it or leave it\". In my professional opinion that would be a marketing (and sales) fiasco the likes of which we haven't even seen before.\n\nAnd you think that the Wii U flopped? That is going to seem successful in comparison, if the single, multi-purpose handheld is going to be an actual thing. Nintendo is not a Swiss pocket knife nor should they want to become one.\n\nI already told other people, like @rjer and @Captain_Gonru that switching to a single device also puts them in a very tough spot if it fails, so when you have two dedicated devices, at least one will succeed. Preferably both, but you'll get the point...\n\nAnd all statements made by mr. Iwata and mr. Kimishima up til now explicitly clarify that it was also never the plan to make a single device. They explicitly stated in unmistakable terms NOT to want to integrate two devices into one: they want to have an \"environment\", ecosystem if you will, like Apple has or like Android is, where multiple devices can take advantage of sharing the same OS or platform, so that sharing software/games will also be much",
      "FORECLOSURE\n\nFORECLOSURE PROCESS IN MAINE\n\n\nWhat is foreclosure?\n\n\nForeclosure is a civil lawsuit in which a bank, mortgage company or other lien holder seeks a court order to sell your property to satisfy a debt. If the court awards judgment to the lender, the lender can have the property sold at auction to pay off the mortgage debt. As a result of the foreclosure, you will lose whatever rights you have in the property.\n\n\nFrom the filing of a foreclosure complaint to the auction sale of the property, the foreclosure process in Maine generally takes 10 to 16 months. As a homeowner, you can participate fully in the process, and you have the right to request free mediation at the courthouse. However, since foreclosure is a legal process, you must follow certain rules carefully to protect your rights.\n\n\nThe Documents\n\n\nBefore a lender can start a foreclosure against you, the lender must deliver to you a Notice of default. You then have 35 days to make any overdue payments. If you don't pay the amount specified in the Notice of Default, the lender may start the foreclosure process.\n\nYour lender may start the foreclosure lawsuit by filing a complaint with the court and by having you served with a Summonsand a copy of the Complaint.\n\n\nThe Summons tells you certain important information, such as the location of the court and the time limit for filing your response to the Complaint. The Complaintstates the plaintiff's (bank or lender) position in the case, such as the nature of the default, the balance due on the mortgage, the identity of any other parties that may claim an interest in the property, and the request for a judgment ordering a sale of the property to satisfy the unpaid mortgage debt.\n\n\nFiling an Answer\n\n\nThe first thing you should do is file a written Answer or Response. By filing a written Answer, you are telling the court that you are not ignoring the foreclosure and you want to participate in trying to save your house. Once you file the Answer, you will receive written notices of whatever is happening in court.\n\n\nTo make it easy for you to respond and to request court-supervised mediation, Maine law requires that when you are served with the other paperwork, the lendermust also provide you with a one-page Answer form that you can fill out, sign and return to the court in the envelope included. Each homeowner should complete his or her own form.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: If you fail to file an Answer or ask for mediation within 20 (twenty) days after the sheriff serves the Summons and Complaint on you, you will lose certain rights and opportunities to save your home.\n\nWhen you mail your Answer to the court, you should also send a copy of your Answer to the lawyer for the lender, so he or she knows you wish to participate in the process.\n\n\nOnce the court receives your written Answer and request for mediation, it will schedule an informational session to help you prepare your financial records. Then the court will schedule the actual mediation session. Carefully keep track of all court appointments, since if you do not appear you may lose the right to have your case mediated.\n\n\nDuring this time you, your housing counselor or your lawyer can negotiate with the lender to see if you qualify for a loan modification program. If these negotiations are taking place, be certain that you don't forget about the ongoing court process. If the lender or a lawyer offers to temporarily stop the court process while you discuss alternatives, make sure you get that promise in writing, since some consumers receive an unpleasant surprise when they realize that the court process has continued while they thought they were negotiating on a loan modification plan.\n\n\nLearn all you can about the mediation program by calling the court clerk or looking at information available on the Maine Judicial Branch's website.\n\n\nIf mediation is unsuccessful and if the court enters judgment against you, the property may be sold unless you are able to exercise your \"right of redemption.\" This means that you need to find another source of financing and pay your current lender back the full amount of the mortgage loan, plus legal costs and fees (not just the payment arrears). The right of redemption exists for 90 days immediately following the court's entry of the judgment. You have the right to remain in your home during the 90-day redemption period. During the redemption period you may continue to try to work with your lender to find an alternative to foreclosure, and you may have other legal avenues of which an attorney could advise you.\n\n\nIf you do not \"redeem\" the property within the redemption period, you do not own the property any more. When the redemption period ends, you can be evicted by the lender in a very short time frame (48 hours) and there will likely be no further court hearings before this happens. The lender is entitled to possession of the property regardless of how much, or little, you still owe, the season of the year, or any other reason",

Here are some useful tips for packing and planning your trek based on my Greenland adventure in August 2015.\n\nWhen I first began planning to hike Greenland's Arctic Circle Trail, it was difficult to find useful details online. There were a few blog posts about the trek, but they were written in German or Danish.\n\nSo this is my attempt to remedy that situation and make the hike more accessible to English speakers who are interested in exploring this beautiful and lesser-known area of the world on foot.\n\nLocated about 30 miles north of the Arctic Circle, the typical route stretches 102 miles (165km) from Kangerlussuaq International Airport to the fishing village of Sisimiut on the West coast.\n\nIt's possible to lengthen the trip to 124 miles by starting from Greenland's ice cap for those who are up for the challenge.\n\nRecommended Experience Level\n\nWhile most of Greenland is covered with ice, the Arctic Circle Trail is ice-free during the summer. Passing through low valleys covered by many lakes, it's a relatively easy walk with regards to elevation.\n\nThe difficulty comes with packing all your own food and supplies to last at least 10 days. Plus a complete lack of civilization nearby in the event of an unexpected emergency.\n\nArctic Circle Trail hikers must have experience surviving alone in the wilderness, understanding their own limits, reading weather patterns, and the ability to navigate unfamiliar terrain using a map and compass.\n\nAt the hike's midpoint, you can be 5 days and 50 miles away from any type of civilization. You're on your own out there. It's not a trek for beginners, but you don't need to be a serious mountaineer either.\n\nHow Long Does It Take?\n\nDepending on fitness levels and the specific route chosen, the traditional 102 mile long Arctic Circle Trail from Kangerlussuaq Airport to Sisimiut can take anywhere between 7-10 days to complete.\n\nTo start from the ice cap like I did, plan for an additional 2-3 days.\n\nIt's important to note that Greenland is a wild and unpredictable place. If you think you can hike the trail in 10 days, make sure to include 2-3 extra buffer days for delays due to weather, injury, exhaustion, or canceled flights.\n\nSeasons & Weather\n\nWhile hiking the Arctic Circle Trail is possible in the winter, it's far more difficult & technical. The primary hiking season is from June to September when the trail is free of snow.\n\nGreenland has a mosquito problem. Swarms can be downright maddening from June until mid August when the first frost finally kills them off. I started hiking August 12th and had to break out my mosquito head net a few times.\n\nThe trail is extremely muddy & boggy in June after the snow melts with river crossings becoming deeper and more dangerous. In September, the risk of snow storms is higher as winter begins.\n\nIn August, the air temperature fluctuated between 60's (F) in the day to 30's (F) at night, with one afternoon of snow flurries.\n\nOver the 10 days I was on the trail, I experienced steady rain for 3 of them.\n\nFlying To Greenland\n\nFlying to Greenland is the most expensive part of this epic trekking adventure. Air Greenland offers regular flights to Kangerlussuaq from Reykjavik, Iceland and Copenhagen, Denmark. So you'll need to get yourself to one of these cities first.\n\nI flew to Greenland from Copenhagen for $1032 USD round trip. Now if you're hiking the Arctic Circle Trail from Kangerlussuaq to Sisimiut, you'll also need to get yourself back to Kangerlussuaq in order to leave the country.\n\nThe one-way flight from Sisimiut to Kangerlussuaq costs about $200 USD.\n\nIf you need help searching for international flights to Iceland or Denmark, make sure to read my popular post about How To Find Cheap Flights.\n\nAccommodation Options\n\nAccommodation in Greenland before and after the hike is expensive. A single room in Kangerlussuaq or Sisimiut will set you back about $100 – $200 USD. A hostel dormitory bed costs between $30 – $40 USD.\n\nHowever both towns also have campgrounds available with bathrooms.\n\nKangerlussuaq Accommodation\n\nKangerlussuaq Youth Hostel\n\nOld Camp Hostel\n\nPolar Lodge (where I stayed)\n\nHotel Kangerlussuaq\n\nSisimiut Accommodation\n\nSisimiut Youth Hostel\n\nSeaman's House\n",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. – Florida Governor Rick Scott, the Florida Panthers and the Tampa Bay Lightning jointly announced today the creation of the Governor's Cup – an annual competition between Florida's two NHL franchises aimed at growing the pride and popularity of the sport in Florida while also supporting youth hockey and education.\n\nThe Florida Lottery and Visit Florida are co-presenting sponsors of the Governor's Cup.\n\nThe winner of the annual season series between the two Atlantic Division and in-state rivals will be awarded the Governor's Cup following the final matchup of the season and each team will make a donation to the other team's youth hockey initiatives. In addition, both teams will provide tickets to local students for Governor's Cup games and select players will take part in local reading programs throughout the season.\n\nGovernor Rick Scott said, \"The Sunshine State is a national leader in sports, and the creation of the Governor's Cup is great news for Florida hockey. This competition is an excellent way to highlight the opportunities that Floridians, and our visitors, have to enjoy all of the wonderful activities that our state has to offer.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled to work with Governor Scott and the Tampa Bay Lightning organization to launch the Governor's Cup,\" said Panthers President & CEO Michael R. Yormark. \"The Governor's Cup is an important initiative for our organization as we look to help grow the sports of hockey in the state of Florida, cultivate the passion of our fans with this great in-state rivalry, and also benefit local youth hockey and education.\"\n\n\"The Lightning are honored to partner with Governor Scott and the Florida Panthers to launch the Governor's Cup this season,\" said Lightning chief operating officer Steve Griggs. \"Our history against the Panthers runs deep and competing for the Governor's Cup is going to be another new, exciting element to this rivalry for our team and fans.\"\n\nThe 2013-14 Governor's Cup schedule is as follows: Thursday, Oct. 10, Panthers at Lightning, 7:30 p.m.\n\nSunday, Oct. 27, Lightning at Panthers, 5 p.m.\n\nMonday, Dec. 23, Lightning at Panthers, 7:30 p.m.\n\nThursday, March 13, Panthers at Lightning, 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe Governor's Cup begins during the 2013-14 season with four games between the Panthers and Lightning – two in Tampa and two in South Florida.\n\nThe winner of the Governor's Cup is determined by the team with the most points during the four Governor's Cup games (two points for a win, one point for an overtime or shootout loss, and zero points for a regulation loss). The first tiebreaker is goal difference.\n\nThe Governor's Cup will be supported by a joint and fully-integrated marketing plan including an official logo, and exposure on television, radio, print, online, outdoor, through social media, and more.\n\nSponsorships are available for the Governor's Cup by contacting Florida Panthers Vice President of Corporate Sponsorships Matt Rickoff at 954-835-7827 or RickoffM@FloridaPanthers.com",

      "During a mid-class break last summer a few students asked me questions about the improv show they just did in class. As I referred to my notes the students became interested in how I write out their shows. I was surprised there was that much interest. I promised I'd write out my short hand technique for logging shows and share it with them. Here it is.\n\nI'm assuming most coaches and teachers have their own way of mapping out shows. I don't expect people to drop what they do and pick up what I'm doing whole sale but if this gets people thinking (and if readers comments get me thinking) we'll all do a better job of it.\n\nBelow is a page of notes from a 3 scene/game Harold. My penmanship is horrendous. (In all honesty this a fake show created from several shows to make sure that I included as many difficult-to-notate twists and turns as possible.) You can click on it to zoom in. I'll also include an easier-to-read transcribed PDF I made of this page with a symbol key below. I use these notations for all shows, not just Harolds.\n\nFirst line is the time the show starts in minutes past the hour, :12 in this case, and the suggestion. \"Orange Whip\"\n\n→ A right arrow symbol denotes an opening, game or group exploration. I try to note the technique used (such as a scene paint (scn pnt) or a we see 8 (ws8)) and a brief note on the content. I separate multiple beats in an opening with a /.\n\n– The dash symbol is a scene. I only write a few words for each scene to jog my memory for later. Usually the first line or a quick impression of the scenes characters.\n\nCircled entries are notes to be discussed after the show. I try to only make note of clearly strong or weak moments and choices to keep post-show notes short and narrowly focused. Deeper, more philospophical discussions can be had in rehearsal. A quick count reveals only 7 notes for this show. Perfect.\n\n↓ This down arrow signifies that a scene or a game was transformed into the next scene rather than changed with a sweep edit. I'm actually pro sweep edits but if a player takes the initiative to try and transform something I like to note to so we can talk about it.\n\n⌊ Down and over lines denote tag outs. I've included two classic tag runs as an example of how complex things can be, not to say that all tag outs must begin tag runs. The first is a scene chain tag run that finishes back at the first scene. The other is a flip between two concurrent scenes. As they occur in the show each tag scene gets a new line below and to the right of the prior scene. I use down/over lines to signify what scene birthed it. If the actions gets wild and fast I'll quite mapping, write \"TAG RUN\" and sort it out later.\n\nI picked up my abbreviation technique while working as classified ad call-taker at the Chicago Tribune. You pay by the line so people wanted things maximally abbreviated. Bd and ba for bedroom and bath. Wbfp? Wood-burning fire place. That's where most of my improv short hand comes from: grp scn – group scene, obj bld – object build, grp explr – group exploration, bsb brkly – Busby Berkeley, clstr fk……\n\nThe last line is the time past the hour when the show ends. : 38, giving a 26 minute show.\n\nAfter the show I'll quickly run through the show giving very brief comments until I reach a circled comment. I'll then spend a few sentences explaining my note. That's it. I try to keep notes at no more than ten minutes.\n\nHaving a consistent method for mapping out shows allows me to quickly and efficiently give notes. It also lets me look back at older shows that I may have forgotten and get a good sense for what happened.\n\nHere's that PDF of my typed notes. Much easier to read.\n\nHarold Map",
      "Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis was back to work in her office Monday morning at the Rowan County Courthouse in Morehead. (September 14, 2015) (Photo: Tim Webb, Special to the CJ)\n\nLOUISVILLE — Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who famously refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples last year, violated the state's Open Records Act, the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General determined in a newly released opinion.\n\nThe opinion revolves around a records request the non-profit Campaign for Accountability made in March for copies of various documents, including ones regarding any retainer or attorney-client engagement agreements between herself or her staff and Liberty Counsel, a different non-profit that has represented Davis since she became embroiled in a legal battle over the marriage-license issue.\n\nLiberty Counsel acted on Davis's behalf when it rejected the records request as improper for multiple reasons, according to the Office of the Attorney General's opinion, which is dated June 30. The Campaign for Accountability filed an appeal in late March and resubmitted its request to Davis in April.\n\nOn Davis's behalf, Liberty Counsel responded to the new request by producing certain documents but withholding others, the opinion said. Liberty Counsel cited attorney-client privilege and legal exceptions for preliminary documents among its reasons for not providing some records.\n\nWhen the attorney general's office asked to see the withheld documents so it could review them, Liberty Counsel refused, saying the request was improper, the opinion said.\n\nDavis didn't violate the Open Records Act by having her private counsel respond to the records request, the opinion said, but she did violate it by refusing to allow the attorney general's office to inspect the supposedly exempt documents.\n\nMat Staver, Liberty Counsel's founder and chairman, said Tuesday that they will provide the documents that were previously withheld in light of this opinion, although there aren't many of them.\n\nThey've never had a problem providing the contents of those documents, he said, but they wanted to make sure no information that was protected by attorney-client privilege was revealed and that the proper procedures were followed.\n\nAlthough Staver hasn't spoken about this with Davis, whom Liberty Counsel represents pro bono, he said he doesn't see any reason at this stage to appeal the office's opinion.\n\nAnne Weismann, executive director of the Campaign for Accountability, said the determination that there was an open records violation was \"absolutely spot-on.\"\n\n\"Well, I think the attorney general was right to call them on completely flouting the law,\" she said.\n\nGroups like Liberty Counsel have been pushing an anti-LGBT agenda in different states, Weismann said. The Campaign for Accountability requested these records to learn more about Davis's relationship with Liberty Counsel.\n\nWeismann cited the importance of carefully handling government officials' representation by private counsel to ensure it doesn't impede their responsibility to the public.\n\nFollow Morgan Watkins on Twitter: @morganwatkins26\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/29fYzGv",
      "I managed to make that 207-mile round-trip with about 25 miles of battery charge remaining when I pulled into my driveway. I never gave a second's thought to range, batteries or kilowatt-hours. I just hauled amps. It's probably best for my driving record that I didn't test the performance version of the Model S, which raises the ante to 416 horsepower — and a 4.4-second dash from zero to 60 m.p.h.\n\nThe Model S, which went on sale in June, is built in a Tesla plant in Fremont, Calif., where a Toyota-General Motors joint venture once made cars.\n\nThe Model S's sleek exterior suggests Maserati, Jaguar — or, especially in the shape of its grille, Aston Martin. \"If people make that aspirational brand reference, I'm psyched,\" said Franz Von Holzhausen, Tesla's chief of design.\n\nPerhaps the design team's greatest accomplishment is lending James Bond styling to a five-passenger sedan that Tesla says has the lowest aerodynamic drag of any production vehicle — an impressive drag coefficient of 0.24. The seductive shape of the Model S beats even the appliancelike Toyota Prius.\n\nYet the S also has a practical side: an optional rear jump seat for two children increases the total capacity to seven. I loaded 30 folding chairs for a school event without needing to flip down the second-row seat. With no engine, the Model S has a sizable second trunk in front, which Tesla calls a frunk.\n\nTesla is all about cranking things up. From the technical side, the car's chief characteristic is abundant power, delivered by exceptionally high currents put through a device called a drive inverter.\n\nThere a lighthearted side, too: in a nod to the 1984 mockumentary \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" the audio system's volume control goes to 11. (The idea came from Elon Musk, the chief executive.) Big-hair headbangers will not be dissatisfied with the rock-concert sound quality.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf the Model S is Aston Martin on the outside, it's Apple on the inside.\n\nThe Bauhaus-stark interior is dominated by a 17-inch touch screen — imagine a jumbo iPad embedded in the dashboard — giving digital control of nearly every automotive function. The interface is brilliant, but potentially spellbinding. Lighting, climate and music selection are intuitive. It let me do things as diverse as raising the chassis when pulling into my uneven driveway to switching the steering feel from comfortable to sporty.\n\nThere's a high-definition backup camera, and full Web browsing is available — even when the car is in motion, a capability that safety regulators may one day frown upon. A Google-style search on the navigation screen, for addresses or a keyword, pulls up results that can be directly converted into turn-by-turn guidance. It is an ingenious improvement in automotive navigation.\n\nAnother innovation is Tesla's ability to wirelessly push new features or software updates to cars already on the road. For instance, Tesla said it would soon be downloading a change on how much or how little the car creeps forward from a standstill.\n\nThe screen size can sometimes seem overwhelming. But its inherent coolness wins the day, especially for the next generation of motorists. When my 15-year-old daughter first saw the car's Web browser, it was \"like\" at first sight: she immediately logged on to Facebook.\n\nThroughout the week, I found myself sneaking away to Berkeley's winding hilltop roads to experience the smoothness of the electric drivetrain. The half-ton battery pack is under the floor, providing a low center of gravity that helps to give the 4,700-pound Model S its ninjalike handling.\n\nAt high speeds and low, the car goes where you put it. Detecting noise intrusion in the cabin requires a stethoscope, although the optional 21-inch wheels add a decibel or two.\n\nThe Model S's charging capability also figuratively cranks up to 11. With 50-amp service from a 240-volt outlet, I added back about 30 miles of driving for every hour of home charging. Highway fill-ups are even quicker for Model S owners using one of the Tesla Supercharger stations in the network announced last week.\n\nTesla hides the charging port behind the driver-side taillight. \"If you're an owner, you know where it is, but there's nothing from the outside that screams 'Plug me in,' \" Mr. von Holzhausen said. When you approach with the charging cord in hand and push a button, the door pops open, revealing the port.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet Tesla sometimes takes its urge to reinvent too far. When parked, the outside door handles completely recede into the body. This makes opening the door a",
      "De novo mutations are important both as sources of diversity in evolution and for their immediate impact on diseases. Scientists at deCODE genetics and their colleagues have used whole-genome sequencing data from 78 Icelandic parent–offspring trios to study mutation rates in humans at the genome-wide level. They find that diversity in the mutation rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the father at the time a child is conceived. For each year increase in the father's age at conception, the number of mutations increases by about two, and once the effects of random variation are accounted for the father's age is estimated to explain almost all of the remaining variation in the de novo mutation counts. Furthermore, the results show that demographic transitions that affect the age at which males reproduce can have a considerable effect on the rate of mutations, and consequently on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia and autism.",
      "The end of competitive season four marks the end of the first year of Overwatch and with it an anniversary event including a dozen legendary skins, dance emotes for each hero, and a retooled arcade with three new maps and two new modes. Jeff Kaplan also gave us some behind the scenes looks at each hero. It's great to see Blizzard taking the time to commemorate the great year Overwatch has had.\n\nSeason five kicks off in just a few days, so let's take a minute to both recap season four and look ahead to the future.\n\nBig changes to Bastion and Lucio\n\nA brand new hero, Orisa, released in season four who I'll get to in a minute. On top of that, two existing heroes, Bastion and Lucio, received pretty extensive reworks. While in turret form, Bastion now has increased bullet spread and cannot crit but takes 20% less damage. His self heal now has its own resource bar like D.Va's defense matrix and can be used while moving. All in all, Bastion is far harder to kill now than he was before. He can heal straight through certain ults and is practically unkillable by squishier heroes like Tracer. The tried and true combo of Bastion-Reinhardt-Mercy is more devastating than ever.\n\nLucio's changes weren't quite as drastic but did change how he is played. On top of slightly increased damage and projectile speed on his primary weapon, the range on his songs has been cut down significantly and a visible ring now shows what that range is. The effectiveness of both songs has been ratcheted up to compensate for the decreased range. Lucio now receives a speed boost when jumping off walls and his alt fire properly takes vertical orientation into account.\n\nOutcry from the community led to Blizzard decreasing Bastion's turret form damage reduction from 35% to 20% just a few days after his update. After playing a full season both with and against New Bastion, I like where he's at. A hero that is literally a robotic turret should both deal heavy damage and be tough to bring down. He should be able to handle flankers nine out of ten times. I was a bit surprised that Blizzard released his patch as it was even after the PTR community spoke out against it. As he stands now, though, Bastion is a suitably strong hero that needs to be attacked carefully. Lucio's floor has been raised considerably since he can no longer stand way in the back and remain effective. His healing is far more useful now that it heals a decent amount, but the days of defaulting to Lucio when you aren't playing well or want a slight break are gone.\n\nOrisa, the first new tank, joins the fray\n\nLore time! After an attack on the Numbani airport by Terry Crews Doomfist, local inventor and child prodigy Efi Oladele wanted to create something that could protect the city. Orisa, the first tank added since release and 24th hero overall, is that creation. Thankfully, Blizzard's teasing of Orisa only lasted a fraction as long as Sombra's.\n\nOrisa's kit feels like a mixture of other tanks. Her main weapon is a gatling gun that she can fire while moving with a slight movement speed decrease (D.Va). Orisa's alternate fire shoot outs a single green orb that pulls enemies towards it (Zarya). It's perfect for pulling back an escaping hero, pulling an enemy off of a teammate or the payload, and, last but not least, booping. Orisa's fortify ability nullifies all movement-related effects for four seconds and gives her increased damage resistance. Not only does she become unboopable™ but she isn't effected by Mei's slow, Reinhardt charges, Roadhog hooks, and more. She can deploy a semicircle barrier at a target location to block up to 900 damage (Winston). Orisa's supercharger ultimate gives all allies in range a 50% damage boost, the same as Ana's nano boost without its other effects. It's a destructible object like Symmetra's teleporter or Junkrat's trap, though, so it must be placed carefully and defended.\n\nJeff Kaplan mentioned in Orisa's intro video that she is meant to be a complement to Reinhardt as the second \"anchor tank\". After playing about 15 games with her, Orisa may have that potential but as she currently stands she falls a bit short. She can definitely dish out damage once you figure out how to properly lead her shots but her head hitbox is comically large. Orisa is tied for the lowest total health pool among tanks at 400, 200 health and 200 armor, but doesn't benefit from recharging shields. She is certainly the easiest post-release hero to feel comfortable with. Ana's sniper/healer combo took players months to get used to and good Som",

      "Karnal: The MLA from Karnal in Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar blamed girls for increasing rape cases in the country.\n\n\nHe said that girls should not try to lure boys and must dress decently.\n\n\n\"If a girl is dressed decently, a boy will not look at her in the wrong way,\" Khattar said. He added that women wearing short clothes are influenced by west.\n\n\nAbout Khap panchayats, Khattar said that their rulings were justified up to an extent as they always tried to abide by the Indian culture.\n\n\nIt is notable that assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Haryana on October 15. Prime Minister already started his election campaign from Haryana and urged people to vote for BJP in majority.\n\n\nWhile talking to IBNLive, Khattar said that Khap panchayats maintain the tradition of a boy and a girl being brother and sister. He added they make sure that both the genders do not see each other in a wrong way.\n\n\n\"These rulings help prevent rapes too,\" Khattar said. He called the pre-marital sex a blot and that it is not acceptable.

      "\"I am not American,\" said the Islamist; \"I am Muslim\" For Islamists, non-Muslim land is different from Muslim land. Many can never identify themselves with a Western land -- or with a flag or nationality -- even though they may have been born in that land and their families may have lived there for generations.\n\nWhen people are brainwashed not to identify themselves with a flag and a nationality, it disrupts the human connections and communications that need to take place within communities. It pits the indoctrinated person against the entire society and his own countrymen, and develops an \"us versus them\" mentality.\n\nThis view brings with it a wish for waging jihad against one's birth country. It creates the priority -- if the country attacking it is ruled by shari'ah -- of joining the enemy to fight against one's birth country. Several years ago, when first in the United States on a teaching scholarship, one issue leapt out. A man asked an innocent enough question: Where I was from? I told him; then, as a courtesy, asked him the same question. \"I am a Muslim,\" he smiled. Thinking that perhaps he had not understood the question -- he sounded American or English -- I asked if he was from the United States. \"I am not American,\" he said again; \"I am a Muslim.\" I subsequently learned that he was an Islamist, a preacher of strict religious teachings, and that many of the people to whom he preached held the same views. In Iran and Syria, where I was born and raised, I had never before heard this answer. Later, while speaking in Europe, these notions kept resurfacing. Radical Islamists, particularly in Britain and France, proclaim themselves first to be Muslim. Even when they speak with English, French or American accents, they do not name their countries -- even to me, someone from the Middle East. Their response signals a reason for concern in the countries they live in now. To begin with, for Islamists, non-Muslim land is different from Muslim land. Many can never identify themselves with a Western land -- or with a flag or nationality -- even though they may have been born in that land and their families may have lived there for generations. This view is far different from that in the Middle East. One day, I asked an American imam why he did not identify himself as an American. Millions of people, I said to him, dream of coming to the US and becoming Americans; why would anyone want to reject this? He quoted said one of the founding fathers of Islamist thoughts, Sayyid Qutb: \"The homeland of the Muslim, in which he lives and which he defends, is not a piece of land; the nationality of the Muslim, by which he is identified, is not the nationality determined by a government; the family of the Muslim, in which he finds solace and which he defends, is not blood relationships; the flag of the Muslim, which he honors and under which he is martyred, is not the flag of a country; and the victory of the Muslim, which he celebrates and for which he is thankful to God, is not a military victory.\" What became apparent was that Western Islamists were far more strict and fundamentalist than the Islamists in the Middle East with whom I had grown up. Once, when I mentioned the name of a deceased imam in a casual conversation with an American Islamist preacher and some of his followers, I forgot to attach a piece of religious praise to the name such as \"Allah's peace be upon him.\" There was a chill. The conversation came to a halt. The American Islamist preacher and his followers did not hesitate to express their anger. What you end up seeing is that when people are brainwashed not to identify themselves with a flag and a nationality, it disrupts the human connections and communications that need to take place within communities. It pits the indoctrinated person against the entire society and his own countrymen, and develops an \"us versus them\" mentality. The indoctrinated group then wants to create its own group. For Islamists, it is an ummah (borderless Islamic community). Emotion and sympathy for fellow countrymen disappear; people feel isolated from other citizens, and view themselves as separate. Respect for the social order and the laws of the land vanish, as Islamic laws become more vital and obedience is then just to shari'ah. Islamist teachings in the West appear to focus on indoctrinating followers to identify themselves with Islamist ideals rather than with a nationality. Moreover, Islamist beliefs are supposed to take priority over anything else, including family and friends. The teachings of these Islamist preachers further echo what Sayed Qutb said: \"A Muslim has no relationship with his mother, father, brother, wife and other family members except through their relationship with [Allah], and then they are also joined through blood. A Muslim has no country except that part of the earth where the Shari'ah of God is established and human relationships are based on the foundation of relationship with God; a Muslim",

These instances do not include moments of personal dissatisfaction or times of protest. While it is legal to express yourself in whatever way you so chose, it is illegal to fly an American flag upside down unless you are in a life or death situation.

      "An \"alarming\" number of whales are dying off the coast of Ghana, conservationists say, prompting concerns for marine life in the west African nation.\n\nCampaigners believe that a record number of whales have been washed ashore in western Ghana in recent days, and claim they have been affected by oil exploration activities in deep waters off the Ghanaian coast.\n\n\"This is a very serious problem – we used to experience around one dead whale every five years, but in the last week alone we have had 16 whales washed ashore,\" said Kyei Kwadwo Yamoah, programme co-ordinator at Ghanaian campaign group Friends of the Nation.\n\n\"We have reason to believe it is related to oil. Almost all of these whales are dying in the part of Ghana where oil exploration takes place. It is well known that seismic exploration can result in the killing of whales,\" Yamoah added.\n\nGhana discovered oil in 2007 and currently produces around 110,000 barrels a day.\n\nThere have previously been warnings that oil production in the country might affect its whale population. An impact statement in 2009 noted at least 18 different species of dolphins and small whales in the region affected by oil exploration, and said that they would be \"vulnerable to disturbance\". Oil companies said they would put \"mitigation measures\" in place, including minimising seismic exploration and helicopter noise in areas heavily populated by marine life.\n\nTullow Oil Ghana, one of the country's main oil companies, was not available for comment when contacted by the Guardian.\n\nGhana's Environment Protection Agency (EPA) said there were no links between the oil industry and the beached whales and stated that similar incidents occurred in other countries.\n\nBut there is concern over the lack of transparency in regulating the impact of oil extraction on whales and other sea creatures.\n\n\"The EPA is not communicating to us and the public. If they are monitoring mitigation, they should publish reports, to show publicly that it is working, or it is not working, and setting out what measures the oil companies should take,\" said Yamoah.\n\n\"For coastal communities, discovering these dead whales is really affecting them psychologically, and they are having to live with the anxiety of not knowing what is causing them to die. Many people believe that their fish may be contaminated.\"\n\nIt's not the first time a link has been drawn in Ghana, which is a major exporter of gold and timber as well as oil, between environmental damage and the extractive industries.\n\nEarlier this year the Guardian reported on the use of mercury in illegal gold mining, causing significant environmental and health risks.",

From Isaiah to Karl Marx the prophets have spoken with one voice. In the Golden Age to which they look forward there will be liberty, peace, justice and brotherly love. 'Nation shall no more lift sword against nation'; 'the free development of each will lead to the free development of all'; 'the world shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea/ With regard to the goal, I repeat, there is and for long has been a very general agreement. Not so with regard to the roads which lead to that goal. Here unanimity and certainty give place to utter confusion, to the clash of contradictory opinions, dogmatically held and acted upon with the violence of fanaticism. There are some who believe and it is a very popular belief at the present time that the royal road to a better world is the road of economic reform. For some, the short cut to Utopia is military conquest and the hegemony of one particular nation; for others, it is armed revolution and the dictatorship of a particular class. All these think mainly in terms of social machinery and large-scale organiza- tion. There are others, however, who approach the problem from the opposite end, and believe that desirable social changes can be brought about most effectively by changing the individuals who compose society. Of the A 1 ENDS AND MEANS people who think in this way, some pin their faith to education, some to psycho-analysis, some to applied behaviourism. There are others, on the contrary, who believe that no desirable 'change of heart* can be brought about without supernatural aid. There must be, they say, a return to religion. (Unhappily, they cannot agree on the religion to which the return should be made.) At this point it becomes necessary to say something about that ideal individual into whom the changers of heart desire to transform themselves and others. Every age and class has had its ideal. The ruling classes in Greece idealized the magnanimous man, a sort of scholar- and-gentleman. Kshatriyas in early India and feudal nobles in mediaeval Europe held up the ideal of the chivalrous man.

      "Atlanta Hawks point guard Jeff Teague (R) drives past Dallas Mavericks' John Jenkins. (Photo : Getty Images)\n\nConsidering their current roster, the Dallas Mavericks have certainly outdone themselves this current season as they are now at a decent sixth place in the packed Western Conference with a 29-25 record.\n\n\nHowever, if they want to lock a postseason spot in the wild, wild West, they need some major upgrades and foremost of which is at the no. 1 starting guard spot that is currently held by injury-prone veteran Deron Williams.\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the point guards the Mavs are reportedly looking at right now is Jeff Teague of the Atlanta Hawks.\n\n\nFansided's Tom West suggested this trade scenario but wisely cautioned that \"this won't be easy for the Mavericks to pull off by any means, so this idea is mainly here for the sake of being ambitious\".\n\n\nThe 27-year-old Teague is arguably one of the best floor generals in the NBA last season, averaging 17.6 points (his career-high), 7.0 assists, and 1.7 steals (also a career-high) in 30.5 minutes of play a night, plus earning his first All-Star Game selection to top it all off.\n\n\nThis season, the former Wake Forest standout is \"underperforming\", though, as he is currently posting declined averages of 15.1 points, 5.4 assists, and 1.3 steals in also a decreased playing time of 28.6 minutes per game.\n\n\nSome analysts blame the steady rise of his backup point guard, 22-year-old Dennis Schröder, who is reportedly being groomed by the Hawks to become their new starting playmaker as Teague is at the same time allegedly placed on the trading block.\n\n\nWith that, Atlanta is said to be looking for their ideal trade partner right now, as per Yahoo Sports' Chris Mannix, and Dallas should be ready to dance if they want to mark their way into the playoffs.\n\n\nEven with Teague's declining numbers, he is still one of the best and most efficient point guards in the league and Atlanta would naturally want some value in exchange for their slowly-becoming-expendable player.\n\n\nWest proposed a trade sending Teague to the Mavs in exchange for Williams and the 2015 21st overall pick Justin Anderson, who is a highly promising wingman.\n\n\nWith the deal, the Hawks will be able to get rid of Teague graciously and send him on a potentially contending team next season while they also receive an experienced backup and mentor for Schröder (if Williams will allow himself to be a bench player).\n\n\nThe addition of Anderson as flavoring for the deal will not really affect Atlanta that much while it gives Dallas an opportunity to groom who could be a reliable role player in the future.",

We try our darndest to make sure we're not anti-anybody.\"\n\nDolan, the charismatic Archbishop of New York, made his comments on ABC's \"This Week\" nearly one week after the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments for and against Proposition 8, California's gay marriage ban, and the Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law that blocks federal recognition of gay marriages.\n\nDolan called for a more conciliatory approach to gay and lesbian Catholics who may feel alienated by Church doctrine, which is traditionally opposed to homosexuality.\n\n\"The first thing I'd say to them is, 'I love you, too, and God loves you, and we want your happiness,'\" he said.\n\nBut Dolan added that he wasn't sure how Catholic leaders should conduct better outreach to homosexuals.\n\n\"I don't know. We're still trying. We're trying our best to do it. We got to listen to people,\" Dolan said. \"Jesus died on the cross for them as much as he did for me.\"\n\nDespite the appeal for inclusiveness, Dolan said the Church is unlikely to reverse their position on same-sex marriage.\n\n\"Sexual love … is intended only for a man and woman in marriage, where children can come about naturally,\" he said.",

And now Zika, which has spread to more than 50 countries and can cause an array of severe birth defects.\n\n\"One of the most efficient killers in the world,\" Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told The Washington Post this year in discussing A. aegypti.\n\nThese days, travel, global commerce and a warming planet seem to be only helping the mosquito to again flourish after widespread eradication efforts in the first half of the 20th century. That could mean more outbreaks of more diseases in more places.\n\nWriting Thursday in the journal Science, Yale University's Jeffrey R. Powell, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, detailed how this species now breeds year-round in locations where it once didn't exist — including in the District and California.\n\n[Zika is the latest battle in a long war between humans and mosquitoes]\n\n\"These expansions are putting at risk large human populations that never experienced aegypti-borne viruses and therefore have no immune defenses against them,\" he wrote. \"This greatly increases the likelihood of severe epidemics.\"\n\nPowell noted that researchers have documented two subspecies of A. aegypti — the human-loving \"Aaa\" and the \"Aaf\" form traditionally found in forests — interbreeding in certain parts of the world from Argentina to Africa. \"The consequences of increasing hybridization between the two subspecies remain unclear,\" he continued, while warning that it could lead to increased genetic variation and still more spread of disease.\n\nPart of what has made A. aegypti such a formidable foe and such an efficient disease transmitter is its ability to adapt. It has evolved to thrive in densely populated places, particularly urban environments littered with old tires, trash and open containers. It can breed in spots as tiny as a bottle cap. Its larvae don't necessarily need water to survive, and eggs can lie dormant for a year or more — only to hatch once submerged in water. The sticky eggs glue themselves to containers as common and varied as the insides of old tires and the edges of birdbaths.\n\n[How a tiny mosquito became one of the world's 'most efficient killers']\n\n\"It's one of those pests, like cockroaches, that has evolved over the last 15,000 years to exploit changes in human behavior and habitation,\" Ronald Rosenberg, acting director for the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a conference this year.\n\nIn an interview this week, Powell called for far stronger mosquito-control campaigns in the United States and other countries.\n\n\"Rather than treating each disease after there's an outbreak, why not spend more money trying to control the mosquito?\" he said.\n\nWhile there is a vaccine for yellow fever, no vaccine exists for other aegypti-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika — although scientists have been racing to develop a Zika vaccine. Powell said scientists have linked the species to hundreds of other viruses, mostly circulating among primates in Africa, that could one day cause the next global outbreak.\n\n\"We know they are there,\" he said. \"We know it's going to happen again.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nHow climate change could worsen the spread of Zika virus and other infectious diseases\n\nWhy Zika is 'much more insidious, cunning and evil' than Ebola\n\nNormal head size at birth doesn't rule out microcephaly, Zika syndrome after birth\n\nWHO no longer considers Zika a global health emergency",
      "One night in June 1914, a 49-year-old Swedish sailor who had recently arrived in New Orleans agonized feverishly in a steamy downtown boarding house. Rushed to Charity Hospital, he would soon die the loneliest of deaths -- in an isolation ward, far from home, surrounded by solemn doctors consulting furtively.\n\nAn autopsy confirmed their suspicions: cause of death was bubonic plague, the dreaded lymphatic disease spread by infected fleas on rats. \"Black Death,\" which had nearly wiped out parts of Europe and Asia in the 1300s, had arrived at New Orleans -- at the Volunteers of America Home at 713 St. Joseph Street, to be exact.\n\nPreviously, bubonic plague had been considered an Old World disease. It had been in recession during most of the era of European contact with the New World, the 1500s to 1800s, and the long journey across the Atlantic further kept at bay the bacteria and its vectors.\n\nThis started to change in the late 1800s, by which time invasive rat populations had established themselves throughout the Americas and larger ships crossed the oceans faster and more frequently. It was just a matter of time before infected fleas would find suitable hosts in this vast new habitat.\n\nThe first bubonic case in the Western Hemisphere appeared in Brazil in 1899. San Francisco was next in 1900, followed by Puerto Rico and Cuba in 1912. All were trading partners with New Orleans.\n\nConcerned, city and state health officials launched a preemptive rat-trapping campaign in July 1912. Within days, they caught an infected rat on the Stuyvesant Docks between Louisiana and Napoleon avenues. No other specimens were found in 1912 or 1913, and authorities breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThen, on June 28, 1914, the Swede died.\n\nA second human case came to light the next day, and additional people fell victim at a pace of one every three days for the rest of the summer. August 1914 saw the peak of the outbreak, and it's safe to say that the average New Orleanian a hundred years ago this month worried more about bubonic plague than the war erupting in Europe, a conflict that would eventually involve the United States.\n\nWhat could have been an epidemiological disaster at the most inopportune moment, however, instead became a resounding public health success.\n\nKey to the control of the epidemic was that federal, state and city authorities took the earliest signs of the plague with utmost seriousness. Working cooperatively and with broad public support, officials pounced on every suspicious situation with overwhelming force -- to levels that might seem heavy-handed today.\n\nResidents of that Volunteers of America Home, for example, were marched out and quarantined in an old plantation house outside the city, and all furnishings inside were burned in a bonfire on St. Joseph Street while the surrounding neighborhood was put under armed guard.\n\nInfected patients, meanwhile, got sent to a special contagion ward and were treated with a newly devised anti-plague serum so powerful that, in one case, it turned a 108-degree fever into a 96-degree chill and required the ice packs around the man's body to be replaced by hot water bags. \"The patient was literally hauled back from the edge of the grave,\" recounted C.L. Williams, who participated in the response and lectured on it years later.\n\nFor the other 350,000 residents of the city, a three-pronged prevention strategy was enacted. It entailed reducing the rat population through a massive trapping campaign, finding and destroying nesting and breeding \"foci,\" and, finally, transforming the cityscape to separate rats and humans as much as possible.\n\nAn army of 380 workers swept across the city to carry out the campaign. In a single week exactly a century ago, they inspected 6,500 railcars and 4,200 buildings, fumigated 101 ships, trapped 20,000 rodents, laid nearly 300,000 poison baits and discovered 17 infected rats.\n\nUsing good scientific protocols, workers recorded data for each trapped rat, and when a laboratory analysis identified an infected specimen, its point of origin was subjected to a scorched-earth campaign of fumigation, burning, and in some cases, complete leveling. A building right next door to the campaign's headquarters was demolished for this reason. Tactics like these went on daily, citywide, for months.\n\nGround Zero in the geography of rats proved to be the Stuyvesant Docks, where that first infected specimen had been found two years earlier. Here, mechanical conveyors transferred Midwestern grain among railroad cars, ships and elevators.\n\nCoupled with the warm fresh water of the nearby Mississippi River and ample nesting opportunities, the Stuyvesant elevators were a veritable rat nirvana. The campaign made them into a rat graveyard.\n\nCases abated by year's end, but the campaign carried",

      "Fifty years ago today, something rather unique happened in baseball history. It was literally unique—something that had never happened before or since.\n\nOn June 23, 1963, veteran outfielder Jimmy Piersall stepped to the plate for the New York Mets facing Phillies pitcher Dallas Green to lead off the top of the fifth. Piersall swung on Green's offering and made solid contact—home run.\n\nThis wasn't just any homer for Piersall but a milestone homer. It was career homer No. 100. Already 33 years old and without too much power, Piersall knew he wasn't going to get to 200 home runs, so he'd celebrate this milestone in a memorable fashion.\n\nHe decided to run around the bases backwards. Oh, he touched the bases in order: first, second, third, and home. That's not the part he did backwards. He just faced backwards. He backpedaled all the way around the infield.\n\nUh … Oh-kaayy …\n\nClearly, it was a distinctive move. Piersall always had a different reputation. He's most famous for having a nervous breakdown as a young Red Sox player, an event that inspired the Anthony Perkins movie about Piersall, \"Fear Strikes Out.\"\n\nPiersall was always a high-strung player, and his nerves always caused some issues. He came up with the Red Sox in the early 1950s and quickly made a splash for his play—and for his conduct. He'd sometimes imitate other players on the field, which earned some laughs from the fans when he first tried it but became increasingly irksome to other professionals.\n\nIn the summer of 1952, Piersall had a meltdown. He continued to act out, got in a few fights (including one with a teammate), and even spanked the four-year-old child of teammate Vern Stephens. Sent to the minors, Piersall continued to devolve, earning four ejections in three weeks. Suspended, he went into a mental hospital for nervous exhaustion.\n\nPiersall recovered, but he continued to engage in eccentric behavior. On at least one occasion, he ran around center field trying to distract a batter at the plate. He received numerous ejections—over two dozen, including seven in 1960. I once saw a photo of Piersall using bug spray in the middle of an inning while stationed in the outfield. So Piersall's stunt for his 100th home run fit into a broader pattern of eccentric behavior.\n\nNo one has ever celebrated home run No. 100 like that before, and Piersall did it 50 years ago today.\n\nAside from that, many other baseball events today celebrate their anniversary or \"day-versary\" (which is something that happened X-thousand days ago). Here they are, with the better ones in bold if you'd rather just skim.\n\nDay-versaries\n\n3,000 days since Brad Wilkerson hits for the cycle for the second time in his career.\n\n4,000 days since the Indians fire Charlie Manuel.\n\n4,000 days since Florida trades pitcher Ryan Dempster to the Reds for Juan Encarnacion, Wilton Guerrero, and Ryan Snare.\n\n4,000 days since the Marlins and Expos make an eight-player trade.

You wanna know what shoes I've got on? They're Steve Madden ones, alright?' before sitting down.\n\nHer attention is then drawn to the man filming the incident after he tells her: 'Nobody wears Steve Madden no more,' and her friends jump up and charge towards him asking him what he is doing.\n\nHe backs off but Howard knocks the phone from his hand – sending it flying to the ground but it is still recording and he tells her 'you're petty as hell – you can't even afford this.'\n\nThe man picks it up but she knocks it from his hands again before continuing her attack on Pena.\n\n'You sound stupid,' she shouts at him from behind before hitting him on the back of his head with her boot.\n\nHoward and Pena were reportedly both arrested at the W. 4th St. subway station at about 5am Saturday along with Howard's friends Kevin Gil, 21, and Shanique Campbell, 20\n\nHe then swiftly turns round and slaps her hard across the cheek, creating a loud smacking noise.\n\nThe girl's friend jumps in and the situation quickly spirals out of control with several people trying to hit each other, while the cameraman screams in excitement.\n\nAnother man steps in to break up the fight and eventually two of the men are separated.\n\nPena was left bleeding profusely after being attacked and at a press conference, he showed off his injured ear.\n\nThe video, titled 'Man smacks the soul out of girl on the NY Subway', has since gone viral and even led to remixed versions online.\n\nHoward and Pena were both arrested at the West Fourth Street subway station at about 5am Saturday along with Howard's friends Kevin Gil, 21, and Shanique Campbell, 20, who had jumped into the fight to support her.\n\nThe young woman's friends jump up when they see that another passenger is recording the argument\n\nHoward continues to taunt Pena by telling him he sounds stupid before she hits him on the back of his head\n\nThe New York Daily News reports that Pena, Gil, and Campbell were each charged with misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct while Howard was charged with felony assault using a weapon.\n\nAnother man jumped to her defense as scenes descended into chaos with the men raining punches down on each other.\n\nBut charges against Pena were later dropped after it was proven he acted in self-defence.\n\nA tearful Pena said if he hadn't been provoked he would never have hit a woman - or anyone else, reports NBC4.\n\nHe also said that the sorry incident had left him scared to use the subway and to even wear his favorite 8-Ball jacket.\n\n'I can't wear my jacket anymore,' said Pena, explaining that he was worried it might provoke an unwelcome response from someone who recognized him from the incident.\n\nPena moved to New York City from the Dominican Republic to play minor league baseball for the Oakland A's, but his pitching career was sidelined when he injured his leg in 2010.\n\nA tearful Pena said he was left with no choice after Danay Howard attached him with her 6-inch high-heel shoe and injured his ear",

      "LeeVester Brown\n\nThe state Supreme Court has ordered a new trial for a Mississippi man convicted by testimony citing the now-disputed Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n\nJustices concluded the trial judge wrongly denied LeeVester Brown's request for the funds to hire an expert to review the autopsy conducted by Dr. Steven Hayne, who concluded the child's death was a homicide consistent with the syndrome. Brown is now serving a life without parole sentence.\n\nIt's the second case the high court has tossed in recent months involving the Shaken Baby Syndrome. Since 2000, at least 11 Mississippians have been convicted in such cases with two of them sitting on death row.\n\nOne of them is Jeffrey Havard, who was convicted in 2002 after Hayne told jurors the death of 6-month-old Chloe Britt was a homicide and that her injuries were consistent with her being shaken to death — a claim he now doubts.\n\n\"This case does fundamentally recognize if you don't have an expert, your hands are tied,\" said Havard's lawyer, Graham Carner of Jackson. \"The science has changed.\"\n\nFor decades, Shaken Baby Syndrome was widely accepted, diagnosed through a triad of symptoms: subdural bleeding (blood collecting between the brain and the skull), retinal bleeding (bleeding in the back of the eye) and brain swelling.\n\nIn the years since, medical belief that these symptoms provided iron-clad proof of homicide has begun to crumble with several studies raising doubts.\n\nIn 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the syndrome diagnosis be replaced with \"abusive head trauma.\"\n\nHayne told The Clarion-Ledger earlier this year that there was \"growing evidence\" his shaken baby diagnosis in the Havard case was \"probably not correct\" because shaking alone isn't able to generate enough force to cause such injuries.\n\nLike Brown, Havard sought funds for an expert in his case.\n\n\"This case is a trend nationwide and in Mississippi with Shaken Baby Syndrome being placed under the microscope,\" Carner said. \"The question is how do you handle forensic science in shaken baby cases?\"\n\nLast week, the state Supreme Court threw out Brown's 2006 conviction in Coahoma County because the judge failed to provide him funds to hire an expert.\n\nLawyers for the state of Mississippi had argued Brown was too late to challenge the Shaken Baby Syndrome because he failed to bring it up at trial.\n\nJustices disagreed, saying Brown \"is arguing that the Shaken Baby Syndrome theory is invalid, and he argues he simply had no way to challenge that theory without his own expert.\"\n\nIn 2002, Brown and Shirley Myles married and had a son, Le'Anthony, who was born six weeks' premature.\n\nOn March 28, 2003, Myles gave their 6-month-old son a bottle containing milk and cereal at 1:25 p.m. before returning to work.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, she testified she got a call from Brown, telling her to return home because Le'Anthony had choked on some milk, was having trouble breathing, and they needed to take him to the emergency room.\n\nA helicopter arrived at the Clarksdale hospital at 5:40 p.m. to transport the baby by helicopter to University of Mississippi Medical Center. A minute after taking off, the child went into cardiac arrest and died.\n\nHospital personnel let Brown hold Le'Anthony. Myles came in later and held him, too.\n\nHayne conducted the autopsy, concluding the death was a homicide, and police questioned Brown.\n\n\"I don't know what happened,\" he told them. \"I know I didn't do nothing to him. I didn't harm him in no kind of way — no kind of way at all. When they come up with this shaken, I don't know. The only thing I know, I did not harm him.\"\n\nWhen detectives told Brown his story didn't \"match up\" with what happened to Le'Anthony, he replied that he didn't care what they said, he did not harm his son.\n\nThe police handcuffed Brown and took him to jail. He was unable to attend his son's funeral.\n\nWith the help of family and friends, he finally posted $75,000 bond and was able to hire a lawyer.\n\nBut he said he still couldn't afford to hire an expert pathologist to examine the autopsy.\n\nProsecutors called the defense's request a \"fishing expedition,\" and the judge denied it.\n\nAt trial, the emergency room physician said she did not notice any bruises, abrasions, scars or anything else abnormal.\n\nMyles testified she never saw any evidence of abuse or Brown \"getting rough\" with Le'Anthony.\n\nHayne told jurors the child's death was a homicide and that it \"would take the violent shaking of a child to produce these types of injuries.\"",

      "A 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy has been detained by federal immigration authorities in Texas after she passed through a Border Patrol checkpoint on her way to a hospital to undergo emergency gall bladder surgery.\n\nThe girl, Rosamaria Hernandez, who was brought over the border illegally to live in Laredo, Tex., when she was three months old, was being transferred from a medical center in Laredo to a hospital in Corpus Christi around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when Border Patrol agents stopped the ambulance she was riding in, her family said. The agents allowed her to continue to Driscoll Children's Hospital, the family said, but followed the ambulance the rest of the way there, then waited outside her room until she was released from the hospital.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, according to family members and advocates involved in her case, immigration agents had taken her to a facility in San Antonio where migrant children who arrive alone in the United States from Central America are usually held, even though her parents, who both lack legal status, live 150 miles away in Laredo.\n\nHer placement there highlighted the unusual circumstances of her case: The federal government maintains detention centers for adult immigrants it plans to deport, facilities for families who arrive at the border together and shelters for children who come by themselves, known as unaccompanied minors. But it is rare, if not unheard-of, for a child already living in the United States to be arrested — particularly one with a serious medical condition.",
      "Last May, the U.S. Supreme Court issued what was perhaps the most significant death penalty ruling in a decade when it rejected Florida's standard for putting to death defendants who may be intellectually disabled. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that capital punishment for the intellectually disabled is unconstitutional. But Florida was one of several states that was arguably doing it anyway, by making the standard for proving disability so onerous that almost no one could meet it.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court only struck down Florida's law, the ruling paved the way to challenge other state provisions that make it near-impossible to prove that a state is about to illegally put an intellectually disabled man to death, such as those in Georgia and Texas. But this week, a county judge rejected a legal challenge in Georgia, finding that death row inmate Warren Hill has \"not cited any new law or evidence sufficient to overcome the procedural bar.\"\n\nSeven different mental health experts who have evaluated Hill all now agree that he has an intellectual disability (previously referred to by the courts as \"mentally retarded.\"). Hill also has an IQ score of 70. But all of that wasn't enough to meet Georgia's near-impossible standard of proving mental disability beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, Warren Hill remains on death row.\n\nIn its Supreme Court decision last may, Justice Anthony Kennedy invalidated a Florida standard that allowed one IQ score for death row inmate Freddie Lee Hall to be the sole determinant of whether he had an intellectual disability and would be sent to death. \"This rigid rule, the Court now holds, creates an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed, and thus is unconstitutional,\" Kennedy wrote for a five-justice majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy's ruling did not address the ways that other states like Georgia have created an equally high risk that individuals with an intellectual disability will be executed. But Kennedy did reaffirm the constitutional commitment to protecting vulnerable populations like the intellectual disabled. In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that \"death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal,\" reasoning that their disability \"places them at special risk of wrongful execution.\" Executing an intellectually disabled inmate also does not serve the typical goals of punishment. It is inherently not rehabilitative. And it is particularly unlikely to deter crimes or serve as a meaningful punishment to those criminals who are incapable of understanding the nature of their acts.\n\nKennedy wrote that \"Florida's law contravenes our Nation's commitment to dignity and its duty to teach human decency as the mark of a civilized world. The States are laboratories for experimentation, but those experiments may not deny the basic dignity the Constitu­tion protects.\"\n\nDespite this brand new Supreme Court precedent, Butts County Superior Court Judge Thomas H. Wilson concluded that, \"This Court is of the opinion that the Hall [v. Florida] case is not sufficiently on point to justify a Habeas decision overturning the current Georgia law.\"\n\nHill's motion to have his death sentence reconsidered was thus dismissed by Wilson, but not before Wilson encouraged the Georgia Supreme Court to review the case. \"In light of the severity of the penalty in this case, this Court hopes that, in reviewing Petitioner's application to appeal, the court will fully consider any application of Hall v. Florida to Petitioner's case.\" He notes that Warren's case would \"in its factual concept be a perfect and definitive decision in this area of law.\"\n\nIn its ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court only addressed Florida's standard, which allowed a court to rule on a defendant's disability based on one administration of an IQ test, even when other factors and even other IQ tests suggested intellectual disability.",
      "Designer Olalekan Jeyifous has created a dystopian vision of shanty-town towers in Lagos, Nigeria, to highlight the poor standard of living in the city's impoverished areas (+ slideshow).\n\nEntitled Shanty Megastructures, the designs transform shanty dwellings into sleek high-rise towers in the centre of Lagos – Nigeria's largest city, and the location of its main industrial and commercial activities.\n\nJeyifo has created a video outlining the concept for his shanty town structures\n\nNigerian-born Olalekan Jeyifous, who is based in New York, wanted to draw attention to the poor standard of living within the deprived settlements by moving them into the centre of the city.\n\n\"These images juxtapose sites of privileged and much coveted real-estate throughout Lagos, Nigeria, with colossal vertical settlements representing marginalised and impoverished communities,\" Jeyifous told Dezeen.\n\n\"The dispossessed are given prominence and visibility, albeit through a somewhat dystopian vision, which highlights that these communities often suffer from a lack of appropriate sanitation, electricity, medical services, and modern communications,\" he said.\n\nJeyifous' images feature grand cylindrical towers comprised of a patchwork of materials, including corrugated metal and sheets of plastic.\n\nRelated story NLE's floating school casts anchor in Lagos Lagoon\n\nThe structures are linked by a rollercoaster-like network of looping walkways. These are raised above deadlock traffic and planted with greenery, while waterways underneath suggest transportation by canoe.\n\n\"Shanty town\" is the name often given to improvised housing developments on the outskirts of cities. These areas often have no access to basic infrastructure, including clean drinking water, electricity and waste disposal.\n\nLagos' shanty town is located in the Makoko district, which is on a lagoon on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, and is where architect Kunlé Adeyemi built his controversial floating school.\n\nParts of the towns have been destroyed by the government to make space for private sector developments – another issue that Jeyifous wanted to raise.\n\n\"It's a conversation about how slums are frequently viewed as unsightly eyesores to be bull-dozed, leaving their inhabitants completely displaced,\" the designer explained.\n\n\"This is a standard practice that occurs from Chicago to Rio de Janiero, and throughout the world.\"",
      "It's the stuff of science fantasy, but a respected American surgeon says that, within five years, he will be able to graft wings and tails on to human beings. Johann Hari on the bizarre world of radical plastic surgery\n\nThe TV sketch show Smack the Pony recently featured a hilarious scene in which a woman turned up at a plastic surgeon's clinic bearing a picture of a wolf. \"I want to look like this, please,\" she explained, and people chuckled in living rooms across Britain. Across the Atlantic, however, there is a respected plastic surgeon who really is working on plastic-surgery techniques which could make us resemble animals in ways we can't even imagine today.\n\nDr Joe Rosen is not a quack. He works at the acclaimed Dartmouth Medical Centre, and has been a scientific advisor to Nasa. He is fond of making statements such as: \"Human wings will be here. Mark my words.\" He believes in all seriousness that within five years he will be able to graft wings on to a human being's body. This is possible because our brains adapt to create neural maps for new body parts. When we have a limb amputated, our neural map of that limb gradually fades away; and if we gain a body part, our neural map expands accordingly.\n\n\"If I were to give you wings, you would develop, literally, a winged brain. Our bodies change our brains, and our brains are infinitely mouldable,\" Rosen has said.\n\nSurgical techniques already in existence can be used to stretch torso fat and rejig rib bones to create a wing. Although no human would be able to fly, they would resemble angels and have full sensation in their new hanging, boned flaps of flesh. Rosen has designed blueprints. This is the new world of radical plastic surgery, where Rosen is Moses. He would not be content to settle merely for wings either. He has been working on cochlear implants to enhance human hearing (a procedure which the US military has shown interest in, raising as it does the prospect of super-human soldiers), and even tails.\n\nIn a conference speech last year, Rosen asked: \"Why do we only value the average? Why are plastic surgeons dedicated only to restoring our current notions of the conventional, as opposed to letting people explore, if they want, the possibilities?\" He says it is only our \"Judaeo-Christian conservatism\" that is holding us back.\n\nIf the medical-ethics board allowed it, Rosen insists he would carry out these procedures. And, as the case of Severino Antinori, the Italian doctor hell-bent on cloning a human, shows, once the technology and the will to experiment exist, it is very hard for even the most overwhelming ethical qualms to block these actions. Sooner or later, Rosen's plans will be put into action: just like the mouse with an ear on his back, one day soon a winged human will force us to re-examine the fundamentals of human life.\n\nSo it's time that we started to ask serious questions about the people who will be the guinea pigs in the radical plastic-surgery revolution. Put bluntly, who the hell would want wings or a tail? We can perhaps find answers by looking at people today who have already changed their bodies in radical and seemingly unnatural ways. Jim Rose, the head of a gross-out travelling circus or \"freak show\", has considerable experience of people who drastically alter their bodies. A former colleague of his known as Enigma now has horns. Seriously.\n\nEnigma's horns are implanted deep into his skull. They are made of coral, which is recognised by the body as similar to bone. Each year he has progressively larger coral implants because it is taking time for his skin to stretch. He only gave up on his dream of having jewelled eyebrows embedded into his face when doctors told him forcefully that having transdermal implants near hair follicles was extremely dangerous.\n\nSo Rose's friends and colleagues such as Enigma are exactly the kind of people who will be first in the queue for Rosen's new operations. He says that, \"Rosen is talking their language. I've worked with people with split tongues because they want to be like lizards, people who want to look like cats. I've lived with these people on the road for years, and believe me, they're very interested in operations that could give them tails or wings.\"\n\nHe has interesting insights on the psychology of people drawn to this kind of procedure. \"If there's one thing that the outrageously altered have in common, it's an incredible need for attention. Most of them in their past have felt overlooked, usually by a parent. That gives them a mindset that's like, 'I will not be ignored.' Because of their desperate need for attention, they're usually happier after they've been altered [for example, by being covered with tattoos].\" But the attention they receive \"almost always causes this unbearable kind of eg",

      "Economist here , this is extremely untrue , VAT and GST are by far considered the best kind of tax to use as a country specifically because they ( in theory ) can avoid creating any market distortions , and do n't leave glaring gaps in your application . Yes this does lead to the tax not being progressive , but you do n't in any way want to use taxes to close your income equality issues as taxes inherently require you to only apply them to people who take part in specific financial transactions . Not everyone that needs government help participates in the transactions that can be taxed . What you want ideally is to have excise taxes like VAT only , and then use subsidies and direct payments to even out your income equality . Having progressive taxes means you have to determine who is poor and who is not based on the type of financial transactions they do , which immediately gets ridiculously inaccurate . That 's why we have to have income taxes filed as joint or married , have people claim a number of dependents , have people claim special deductions , etc etc etc . and even after all this differentiation we STILL ca n't accurately determine who is poor and who is n't , and that 's before you consider that people will change their habits in response to being taxed , which means even if you came up with a magic perfectly calibrated progressive tax today , by tomorrow it would be way off the mark as people shift their habits . Yet if we use only subsidies to make sure people are n't poor you can have a 100 % success rate by simply providing for the basic needs you want to all the people you have .

      "While you might assume that raising the minimum wage is great , ' Hey , more money for everyone at the bottom ' , the reality is more complicated . Raising the minimum wage will often cause lower overall employment , companies will begin to substitute labor for other goods . For example , say you run a fast food joint , that employs 10 people to cook , clean , and serve all the food . They earn minimum wage , and suddenly that cost goes up . As an owner , you look at the cost and realize that you could now save money by only employing 8 people , and instead buying an automatic french fry making machine . So while the 8 people left make more money , two are out of a job because its no longer cost effective to employ them . Another example , say you run a business and minimum wage is $ 7 . You 've figured out that if you hire one more person , you can earn $ 9 more per hour . So you hire the person , earn 9 , pay 7 , and are happy . But now the minimum wage gets raised to $ 10 , you realize that you 'll need to fire that employee , because they no longer make what they cost . It 's often said that the minimum wage takes the bottom rung out of the employment ladder .

      "The assumption that house value appreciates 5% per year is unrealistic. Over the very long term, real house prices has stayed approximately constant. A house that is 10 years old today is 11 years old a year after, so this phenomenon of real house prices staying constant applies only to the market as a whole and not to an individual house, unless the individual house is maintained well. One house is an extremely poorly diversified investment. What if the house you buy turns out to have a mold problem? You can lose your investment almost overnight. In contrast to this, it is extremely unlikely that the same could happen on a well-diversified stock portfolio (although it can happen on an individual stock). Thus, if non-leveraged stock portfolio has a nominal return of 8% over the long term, I would demand higher return, say 10%, from a non-leveraged investment to an individual house because of the greater risks. If you have the ability to diversify your real estate investments, a portfolio of diversified real estate investments is safer than a diversified stock portfolio, so I would demand a nominal return of 6% over the long term from such a diversified portfolio. To decide if it's better to buy a house or to live in rental property, you need to gather all of the costs of both options (including the opportunity cost of the capital which you could otherwise invest elsewhere). The real return of buying a house instead of renting it comes from the fact that you do not need to pay rent, not from the fact that house prices tend to appreciate (which they won't do more than inflation over a very long term). For my case, I live in Finland in a special case of near-rental property where you pay 15% of the building cost when moving in (and get the 15% payment back when moving out) and then pay a monthly rent that is lower than the market rent. The property is subsidized by government-provided loans. I have calculated that for my case, living in this property makes more sense than purchasing a market-priced house, but your situation may be different.",
      "I would be surprised if a bank cared about an undergraduate major. Usually, such things are only important if it is a professional degree, like a law degree or medical degree. The big issue is that if you are not a US citizen, a US bank would be unlikely to make an unsecured loan because you could just return to your country and renege on the loan and they would have no way to collect. Therefore, a bank in your own country might be more logical. If you get accepted by a top Ivy school, they all have financial policies that will allow you to attend regardless of how rich or poor you are, so if you are applying to a top school (Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Yale) and get accepted, they will fully finance your attendance. The only exception is if (A) they find out you lied about something, or (B) your parents/family are wealthy and they refuse to pay anything. As long as neither of these two things is true, all of the schools listed GUARANTEE they will provide sufficient financial aid. Princeton even has a no-loan policy, which means not only will they fund your attendance, they will do so without you having to take on any loans.",

He felt maybe he'd let his genius take over a little too much the first time, so he dumbed down the next set of clues. He was sure THIS would be his debut. He'd hung a hedge fund embezzler who people had been looking for for years. It was simple, straight forward, and would clearly show his ruthlessness and cunning. Instead somehow it led the police to claim it was a suicide and the clues left behind led them to all the missing money. The only problem was he was absolutely certain that the money had all been spent. In fact, the embezzler had secreted back into the country to start some new scheme because he was broke. It just didn't make any sense. Marcus was furious after that. \n \n Still he waited the requisite number of days before choosing his next victim. He had to stick to the process. Instead of",

      "It's so strange to think of the way we used to be. Since the merging act of 2083, humankind has learned how to integrate technology with the brain. Language barriers are a thing of the past as thoughts intended for communication are written in the language of the listener just above the speaker's head. In fact, this advancement in human evolution has revolutionized the way we communicate. There are, however, side effects to this method of communication. Every once in awhile the deepest, most sincere thoughts that a person has are being displayed in a pop-up message above their head. This occurs when they want to convey a message that could be socially condemning, or illegal. This functionality has led to the reduction of prisons, and criminal activity wo",

Nothing I did seemed to help ; caffeine would work for a couple of days, but as soon as tolerance hit I was right back to square one. Then I started forgetting things. Words would evaporate as I started to speak, and other people's voices would enter my ears as noise, with no more meaning than the sound of the horribly obsolete printer. And I was in pain. My back burned, my legs throbbed, and no amount of Tylenol or Advil would touch it. \n \n After only 3 months, I was let go. \n \n Determined for this not to happen again, I sought medical attention.

Of course this one was embedded in the ground, and only half of what I assumed to be an entry hatch showed.

John's head spun on his neck, it twisted in its place, and he could not stop it. Muscles ached and begged for relief ; but the rain continued. Human instinct took over, and he wanted to hide beneath the dashboard, to curl up on the pedal and let destiny take him, but he stuck, and he pushed against the metal harder than he ever did.

Pete became Terry when he joined. \n \n Pete returned to their living room with a pound-jar of Nutella and two spoons. \n \n ``Terry, you sure know a way to a man's heart.'' \n \n The two each took a spoonful of Nutella. A quietness swept over the apartment. From outside, car doors and engines provided ample white noise to keep the apartment from being completely silent. Living just a block away from the university, Pete didn't bother bringing his car to campus, mostly because he didn't have one, and Aaron's car was in a garage having her engine worked on. \n \n Aaron finished his first spoon, but before he scooped a second, he got up and went into the k",

He ’ d rather work twice as hard than lose twice as much when he failed. He made up for it by working twice as hard and twice as long. He wanted to get all the work out of the way so that he could understand what it was like to live in uncertainty instead of hard work – he wanted to explore the other side of the risk-reward curve now that he had money safely tucked away. He had read that day traders struggled with “ money management ” more than anything and his books told him the same thing. He didn ’ t realize that the psychological parameters might prohibit him from expressing his honest, authentic personality of self-confidence – lest he lose everything. \n \n “ Maybe I should chan",

But they're used to teachers instantly taking control, so it isn't long before my lack of reaction to a tendril of flame here or miniature storm cloud there makes them think that they have free reign. I start pulling out beakers and chemicals from drawers and shelves and, while some are looking at what I'm doing eagerly, to most I'm invisible, as if that's my actual power. This is a fairly small class, so I only grab eleven beakers. I put equal amounts of water in ten of them, and a lot more to the eleventh. I then put a small amount of potassium iodate into all of them. A chunk of starch goes into the beaker with the most water, I shake it to get it to dissolve completely. I vary the amount of sodium sulfite as precisely as I can for each beaker except the main one. Finally, some citric acid to those ten beakers and we're almost done.

      "The earliest known city was founded on the coast, though it appears that the original settlers actually travelled there from one or two hexes away. \n \n Perhaps they were drawn by the sugar which grows there, or the river. Most likely, both. \n \n They named their city ``Carthage''. From this early time, we know very little. The city grew and there were some minor skirmishes with unknown people ; probably roaming tribes. The remains of some of their camps have been found, and the odd trinket. But nothing more is known of these people or the battles which they fought, other than they were exterminated ruthlessly by Carthage. \n \n We know that the first Carthaginians arrived in the court of Attilla the Hun shortly after the founding of Carthage, and that Shaka sent representatives to Carthage not long afterwards. \n \n We can see slightly later evidence of Shaka's warriors descending from one direction, and Attilla's from another. \n \n There is evidence of a few large battles around Carthage at this time. \n \n And that's it. That's all there is. We shall probably never know what happened ; but legend has it that the inhabitants of Carthage simply vanished into thin air : taken by the ancient god ``Rage",

But it's bedtime.'' \n \n With a huff and a puff, Jimmy pulled his covers up, getting ready to sleep for the night. His mother sat on the edge of the bed and watched him get comfortable. She moved to get up to head to her own room, but he called out, ``Wait!'' \n \n She paused in her movements, and Jimmy blushed, having had no actual reason to call out to her. He thought of a list of excuses, and quickly blurted out, ``Tell me about the Homo sapiens!'' \n \n After a moment, his mother sighed. ``I've told you this story many times,'' she chided, but Jimmy pulled out his best puppy face, and she couldn't resist. \n \n ``Okay, I'll tell you the story, then you must ",

Those that touched her and were stained with her puss and blood were washed and cleansed in the Fountain of Life by the priests, and so many were they and so much was the blood that the pool clogged. Some say that the waters stopped flowing altogether, even from the source. When they were done they left the chamber and set fire to it. They did not cleanse Lorac as they did themselves in the Water of Life, but purged her from this Earth in flames. \n \n \n She looked to the four walls of the chamber that represented the four aspects of the Sacred Fire : Hope, Strength, Valor, and Justice. She looked first to Hope and prayed that she might be cured and counted again among the people of Om, but the wall burned. She looked to Strength and found that her flesh held none and would find none. She looked then to Valor and took from it what she could before fire con",

      "I've enjoyed the sound and sight of the tide coming in ever since I was a child ; that subtle distinction that the waves are slightly longer, that the beach will soon be full, reclaimed by nature if only for a short while. It's as if the ocean is my moat and this town is my castle, and so long as the moat remains full, I know I'm safe and I have nothing to fear. \n \n It's such a nice feeling to be able to have these days. I know across those waves there are city's with buildings so tall that they reach the sky.

To share a bit of heaven with the rest of the world. \n \n But it's our paradise, it belongs to no one else, we've had people try to take it before, the abandoned ware-house we once used for trade no longer holds goods after it was bombed, it holds festivals in celebration of our Independence We hang tiny bells from the bits of debris across the roof of every ",
      "''Stay a while and listen!'' I proudly proclaimed, eager to share my knowledge with the young necromancer. He did nothing of the sort, instead leveraging my rescue from Tristram by forcing me to identify his copious arsenal of ramshackle weapons and armor. The deed accomplished, he ran off to exchange his loot for gold, without a second glance at me, and disappeared into a town portal. \n \n This was 2 years ago, and ever since, I can only stand here, by this infinite campfire, shuffling among small routes planned for me, unbending to my volition. Every month or so I glance at my closest friend Warriv, only to see his empty stare, the great adventurer and sea captain reduced to a mere spectre. It has been many, many moons since he brought an adventurer to the desert town of Lut Gholein, battling the high seas, raging storms, and furious winds. \n \n An arrival! Alas, it is only the soulless chanting ones, endlessly proclaiming their purpose and stating their business, hollow men and women endlessly advertising their mercantile ways. To whom? To what purpose? We have no gold. We can not escape this place. Yet still they return in droves, their pallid faces stark against the black of night, to chant their wares into the abyss. Some days I doubt they are alive. \n \n I am Deckard Cain, and my purpose here is finished. Yet I",

And now it is time to take one last thing. I situate myself on the edge of a bridge, the dark stormy clouds of the night rolling in. I gaze down, barely able to make out the shallow waters before me. I take a deep breath. Am I really going through with this? I start to rationalize my peril, considering the ramifications that my end would cause. However, the more I think about it, the closer my feet move towards the edge. I ’ ve lost all who care for me, all that truly matters. I have no one left in this world. And soon, no one will have me. I steel myself and take a step back, ready to leap from the platform. That is however, until someone grabbed me by the hand. \n I instinctually break his grasp from me and turn to see who found me. He had light skin and soulless red eyes. His dark hair hung messily over his face and he wo",
      "*I hope she never knows why she's* really *afraid of the dark... * \n \n I did a horrible thing. And to my daughter, no less. \n \n It began nearly fifteen years ago, with Project Jahuda - designed to test the limits of the human mind. My then-wife was pregnant at the time, and she foolishly agreed to be a test subject for the Project. \n \n Whilst carrying my daughter, she was injected with a cocktail of cyrostabilising drugs and put into matabolic stasis. It was during this that the actual experimentation began. \n \n First, they introduced neurotoxins, but only in minute doses, and only in the extremities. Then she was brought out of cryostasis, but left to endure agony in her extremities. She was put back in to cryostasis, then injected with a rare plant-based solution, known as Mercadia. \n \n MY then-wife was killed by the cocktail. But that isn't why my daughter is frightened of the dark. She's frightened of the dark *because she can see into the negative-Earth. * This was what the Project Jahuda was trying to do. And it only succeeded once. \n \n If my daughter ever comes to understand that when she dreams, she travels to a parallel world... well, she would become a target. \n \n I will **not** let that happen. I can't afford to. \n \n She stirs and cries out. I hush her, tell her it's going to be okay, then I need to write my findings.

One of the, what Ryan assumed had to be vampires dropped from the roof and landed in front of the king. This time Ryan needed no introduction he recognized the being instantly. Abimelech was a name whispered around the campfires of the last groups of humans for many years.

The more I saw her, the more I knew that I hated her at first sight. \n \n That first day, she looked like a guy really. Huge collared shirt worn over tight jeans and slip on shoes all the kids are wearing today. Her hair was made up in a ponytail, the plainness of her face accentuating her eyebags. Not to mention an upper lip that had seen better days with a razor's fine edge. \n \n It was not disgust though at how she looked though. It was her simple manner that kept me looking.

The other officer glanced over. \n ``I did?'' ``You did!'' ````Oh, sometimes the gun forgets it's capacity.'' \n \n The inspector rubbed a brow, speaking with confusion. ``I-Eh?'' ``Yeah. Having to reload so often is inconvenient.'' The officer loaded his gun, spinning the chamber. He handed the revolver over. ``Try it.'' He shrugs. \n \n The inspector took the revolver and aimed down the range. Six shots- and somehow it still had extra rounds. Nine shots later, the inspector glanced over the gun. ``H-How?'' \n \n The detective shrugged. ``I'unno. Found it in a trash can.'' He took the revolver back, spinning the massive weapon around his thumb. The Inspector held his hands in the air next to his temples, a very flabbergasted expression on his face. \n \n \n ``NOOOO! I NEEDS IT!'' The officer scooted after the inspector in his knees, waving his clasped hands together in a plead. ``Come on! Pleeeeaase?'' ``No! It's against regulations!'' ``How?!'' \n \n ``Aren't you at all concerned how it screws over conventional physics?!'' ``I was gon na ask eventually! Just lem me have it!

He glanced over the gun, taking note of the unicorn and rainbow etched on the barrel. \n \n The gun was taken by another officer down a hall, into a wide double room filled with thousands of weapons, ranging from a mini gun, several swords, hundreds of handguns, a raccoon in a cage, a sharpened pencil, a suit of powered armor and a glaive.

      "``Wow,'' I said. \n \n ``I know, what the fuck...'' I replied. \n \n I had just seen a plane rip apart in the air and crash into the water in a cloud of smoke and fire. Then it hit me. \n \n ``That plane might have saved me.'' \n \n ``Dude, no way. It would have flown right over the island. If anything this crash will save you. They'll come looking for it.'' \n \n ``They would have seen the signal.'' \n \n ``It's a fucking flag, dude. A rag on a stick. And,'' I looked over my shoulder toward the flag, ``it's not even there anymore.'' \n \n I looked back out to the ocean. The smoke was gone. The plane must have been in pieces. I could barely see anything resembling an aircraft on the surface. I figured everyone was killed. \n \n ``Do you realize what just happened?'' \n \n ``What?'' \n \n ``Hundreds of people just gave up their life to save you.'' \n \n ``Did they?'' \n \n ``Yes, and we can't let their sacrifice go in vain. We need to swim out there and make sure we get rescued.'' \n \n So I spent the day gathering supplies. Some water. Leftover meat. A book to read. A plastic bag of ants as snacks. Some leaves as toilet paper. A big leaf to shield the sun. Looked like it was about a few miles away. I didn't want to have to swim back. I didn't want to take too much either because of the weight and all. \n \n The next morning I started the swim. The water was cold, but bearable. The plan was simple. I get there, and find a piece of floating plane stuff that I can sit on, and wait. Unfortunately, I didn't take into account the survivors. And th",

I admit my first hundred years or so of immortality were spent reveling in debauchery. I caroused in every major city across the globe, and every night was spent with a different woman. \n \n After a time though I noticed how bored I was with my life and I set out to create something for my self, a family of sorts.

But even now, as her voice grew strained, Hope tried to give her a focus. \n \n He pounded a thin hand against his hollow chest. ``No one can kill me, I am just tired of this world.

That was the first time he ever had something resembling an opinion. It was most likely random neurons spitting back random results which it categorized as a property worth saving. My son's favorite color was blue. MICHAEL seemed fascinated by baseball too, always asking repetitive questions about the Red Socks, like ``WHAT WAS THE SCORE? WHAT WAS THE SCORE?''. It reminded me of the summer I took my son to Boston to see the Red Socks play. 20 hour work weeks became 10. \n \n MICHAEL was learning.

Her buddy. \n \n Now she is old enough to go to school. I can see her comforter and sneakers from where I am, under her bed. They're pink. We have a quiet, symbiotic relationship.

You couldn ’ t have been a better father to her. Watching her smile whenever you pick her up, and the way you smile right back at her with that same grin I fell in love with all those years ago. The way you never once complained when she cried in the night, those first few months. The way she'd always calm right down after a few minutes of being rocked in your arms, when sometimes it would take me hours to get her back to sleep. She's her father's daughter, no mistaking it. She even looks like you. Everyone can see it. She has my hair, but your eyes. Sometimes, when I put her down for the night, I can ’ t believe that we made such a beautiful little thing together – or how big she ’ s getting.

I'm getting close, but these caves are soaked and humid, a combination that I find unpleasing. \n \n Magician presses each button on the keypad deliberately with every finger he has.

By the time I'm through the door, my five seconds are up. The door remains open. Magician pauses. Magician realizes that something is wrong. As Magician turns around, I jump on Magician, pinning him to the ground. \n \n Magician tries to reach for something in his pocket, but I don't let him. I knock Magician out cold with my hex, leaving a blood spatter on his forehead but his lungs functioning. I then attempt to grab whatever Magician was trying to grab, but as I do, the robot in his pocket jumps out at me and latches onto my right hand. I try to release it with my left hand, but then the robot grabs my left hand too. Magician opens his eyes and wipes the blood off of his forehead. Is this the power of the nanobots that are inside Magician's body? \n \n I don't remember what happens in the next undetermined amount of time, but I wake up confronted by a pile of bodies mostly made up of old men and women, but I also spot the body of Kris who died of the flu earlier this morning.

My voice shakes again, how annoying.. an almost uncontrollable fear keeps washing over me. It's just an old lady I try to remind myself. I remember the fog and the feeling as I walked by her. The intricate pictures on the door. An old lady in student accommodation? \n ``You know what they say about curiosity.'' She says with a broken cackle. ``It killed the cat.'' Her smile drops immediately and she glares at me. \n Everything inside of me recoils, the light in the room dims.

      "Three kisses, the perfect way to sum up a relationship. \n \n The early kisses, filled with tension and uncertainty. Gentle and containing all of the emotion you want to give to the world, but at the same time worried of the thoughts of the other, whether the quick looks when the other isn't looking are coming from their side as well or just yours. Afraid of the scale that you two are currently standing on, that can tip forward into a relationship or back to the searching phase. So much potential, all withheld by both sides. \n \n Then there are the mid relationship kisses. Whether the kiss is long or short, there is no uncertainty involved. Each knows the other more than they know themselves, and every kiss is a reminder that they accept this. That they are welcoming all of the potential that every human encounter offers and that they are willing to continue their encounters for as long as possible. These are the kisses that you never forget, even when you overlook them. The sort of kisses that you will think of in the middle of a stressful day and will instantly calm down and think straight again, and allow you to carry on with your work day. Even better, these are the kisses that can end an argument with the other in a second, to switch from the yelling and anger back into the loving embrace that you two usually hold each other in. \n \n The third kind of kiss. The kiss of memories. Memories of the other kisses, memories of the dreams you held with the other. Dreams of growing old together and living a happy life. Memories that you wish were still reality, but are growing to realize are just dreams that will be forever unfulfilled by the other. A kiss that you wish could help you travel back in time to take back all of the anger and fighting, to be able to make it all better. This is a kiss that tilts your scale back to the searching, but this time searching for what you once had. This is a kiss that will hit you with more emotion than all of the ones you shared before. This is a kiss of parting, a kiss of only ",

He wanted to dream a man. Not any man, however, but a man identical to himself. This fetish could be explained as a natural extension of his profession as philosopher. His opportunities to impose himself on reality were few and far between. His life was a series of consolations. “ There will be time. There will be time. There will be time yet ; time for a million indecisions and decisions. ” \n \n This effort exhausted him. In time there was not one event or thought that did not owe its existence to the effort.

Sure, he'd been feeling a little under the weather. Had even taken a sick day, which he'd always hated doing. Now he was glad he had.

It almost felt like there was a deep hum in the water, but he couldn't imagine what it could be. \n \n Then came the impact. Something smashed into his side, scraping a long jagged gash. A long metal thing, like a distorted whale, glided past him. It churned the water, causing him to bob in the once glassy water. \n \n ``Ow! What the hell?!'' He cried. Small chunks of ice continued to slide down his side into the water. ``Shit, am I bleeding?'' \n \n The thing that hit him continued on, without even stopping to see if he was ok. The iceberg looked around him and saw, except for the whale-thing's path, smooth unbroken water horizon to horizon. \n \n ``Hey,'' the iceberg realized, ``it did that on purpose. What's wrong with that guy?'' \n \n That's when the iceberg noticed the large wound in the side of the whale, just below the waterline. It must have hurt because it had stopped and was resting lower in the water. \n \n ``Is it drunk or something?'' The iceberg wondered. ``Well, serves it right.'' \n \n Small mites were scittering around the top of the whale. A few large copepods had fallen off and floated upside down in the water. The whale set to dive and the water filled with thousands of mites. \n \n ``Ew gross,'' the iceberg cringed. ``Are there any on me?'' \n \n The whale must've been really sick, the iceberg figured. Maybe that's why it stumbled into him.

She was a thin, petite girl, with blonde hair tied up in a bun, wearing a white shirt and grey skirt, who for some reason really caught my eye. \n \n I must have stared for a couple of minutes, looking at her golden locks and subtle curves.

My arms and legs thrash wildly as I try to swim up but I just keep sinking. \n \n \n I still feel the other presences around me and try to grab their attention but nothing happens. I silently beg for their help. “ Help! ” I try to say, but no sound comes out. The water pressure increases every second and soon I feel like I ’ ll be flattened. My body begins to become still. Not because i ’ m dead, but because it ’ s completely sore and I can ’ t move anymore. \n \n \n “ I ’ m dying. Oh god, i ’ m dying, help me! Help me please! ” I continued to try to get help.

Despite all of the water filling me up, it doesn ’ t put out the fire in my lungs and throat. \n \n \n My mind feels completely out of control. There is an overwhelming feeling of nervousness mixed with excitedness in my gut. My heart hits hard against my chest. I have no idea how long i ’ ve been drowning, but it feels like hours.

Then again, my human life hadn't ever seemed real. I wasn't really a normal human, what with being immortal. \n \n Yet, I had never expected this.

      "March 11, 2015 \n \n Dear Diary, \n \n Did you know that ice becomes clear when water freezes slowly? That's amazing! I mean, think about it. It's such a deep analogy for life. \n \n We're constantly submitted to so many societal pressures, forced to strive for greatness as soon as we come out of the womb. And in a world with most information at the touch of a screen, you have to move fast or you will get left behind. Be it the most recent medical breakthrough, a political scandal, or even a pop culture piece, they all matter. If you aren't informed, it's almost like being seen as lesser than. If that happens, it's game over. Your life is practically over. We *have* to be fast to survive. \n \n But water, water is different. It takes control over it's own life. If it wants to move, slow, it does. If it wants to move fast, it can become vaporous and be free. The limits are endless with it! People should be like water, free to move how they want, when they want. I mean, we're made of the stuff, right? It's coursing through our veins but we choose to ignore it. Why is that we *have* to all move to beat of the same drum? \n \n I guess my point is that we shouldn't let others tell us what we should be. After all, water that freezes fast is cloudy while full of clarity when slow. The secret of reaching nirvana is right there in front of us. In fact, it is *all* around us! We should enter the void of the trivial things and become water. We should take control over our lives and see the world for what it really is! \n \n Eternally Enlightened, \n \n Yo",

My baby couldn't be hurt. He needed to wake up. \n \n ``Open up the door, Ms. Jones!'' \n \n ``I'm busy!'' I shouted, when my baby opened his eyes with a sudden motion.

And there was the response. “ Hello, Jason, it's Vlad. ” I flipped out and managed to get a recording of the same theme song from a friend's TV. It had the same message.

They had not taken the task seriously. \n \n Redesdale had quit his job and trained for 18 months before undergoing this expedition to reach the peak. There at the zenith of the world was where the last holder of a primal emotion was said to reside. He had prepared himself mentally and physically for this moment.

Lawrence approached cautiously, considering the emotion this man harboured. Fear was an emotion Lawrence knew even now.

Folks nowadays couldn ’ t even dream of plenty, they dream for enough. \n \n My parents told me stories of our ancestors. How they were angels, flying through the universe with steads made of starlight.

For generations we thrived, but things began to crumble, piece by piece as society turned to dust. \n \n It started slow, a drop lost here, a drop lost there.

But then even the strong, the fighters, and those who were once such great people all began to fall one by one.

I don't usually go for walks, but it was the first bearable day outside and my body was begging for some sunlight. \n \n As I walked, something caught my eye : a bunny! I love bunnies. They are particularly cute, and I suppose their elusive nature just makes them that much more endearing. I continued towards the bunny, as he was along my way, and he hopped along, towards the park near my home. I decided, ``why not follow along and see where his little nest is? Perhaps there will be more bunnies. \n \n I followed the little bunny as he hopped along, his little ears flopping as they do, and his little tail made flashes of white against his otherwise brown fur. He went further into the park, back toward the woods and creek that create the park's border.

And I went off as well. The car didn't call to me as it normally did, but at the same time, it would have been too different to not take it. So I climbed in and drove to work. \n \n Almost everything was the same, except the people who wished me happy birthday. Few and far between as they were. But my desk chair was comfortable, and the work repetitive, and everything fell into the same routine. \n \n Work left, and home called me. And my wife made me the same thing she always makes on Thursdays, stewed beef with rice. For a moment, my heart fell, as though I expected anything different from her.

It's such a pity, that tragic accident. She was one of my best students, after all, and I did grow to be quite fond of her. Students always do find a professor to be quite *attractive*, after all, and she liked to stick around me. Those early morning coffees, those walks on the beach, those long nights we spent together... \n \n But she was too young. Too young and too naive. \n \n And *far* too easily manipulated. \n \n Looking down at her, I prepare myself. She looks so peaceful, so calm. But I have a duty to do, so with no trace of hesitation, I dig in. \n \n **SCHHHHNNNCK** \n \n Her brain is warm, soft and supple beneath my fingers, and with one sharp jerk, I *rip* it out.

Take this one, for example - Two weeks, and she's crazy for me. Running my errands, walking my dog, cooking my dinner... \n \n Killing my wife. \n \n Yes, it really took almost no effort at all, getting her to do the deed. Not like I could have done it - it needed to look natural. Stabbed by a home intruder, blood all over the floor, seeping out, painting the carpet. \n \n And the police are none the wiser for it. \n \n So now, my work is done. All I need to do is wait. The anesthetic will wear off soon enough, and then I'll see. \n \n And true enough, her eyelids flutter beneath the harsh medical light. Trembling, her eyes slowly open. Soft, warm brown ones, not the bright blues that I'm used to. \n \n In the deathly silence that ensues, I dare to ask a single question. \n \n ``How do you feel?'' \n \n At first, no reply. \n \n... \n \n Then she smiles at me. \n \n ``Honey, I'm",

As we grew closer the glow intensified, shining on our faces so that all shadows cast by the sun were drowned out and replaced by long horizontal ones that stretched over the decks and split mens faces into half brilliance, half blackness. I ordered the donning of gas masks, and put up the glass shields over the decks. We moved by motor power mostly now, the only sails that extended above the glass shields were small affairs and could not move the entire ship by themselves. \n \n Without the sails to trim, many of the men found themselves with time on their hands.

She had never worked a day that busy in her life, and she didn't want to again, but they were understaffed, so she knew she was going to work several long days. She silently hoped they wouldn't be as busy, even at the detriment of her tips. \n \n People could be so cruel - the ketchup stain on her uniform proved that. How was she supposed to know the guy wanted a lake of ketchup on his fries? She assumed half a bottle was sufficient. She was wrong, and punished by a ketchup-slathered handful of fries squished onto her shirt and apron. The man didn't tip her. \n \n With a heavy sigh, she removed her wad of tips and her notepad from the apron before dropping the garment into the sink. Her shirt fell in a heap on top if it, and sheturned on the hot water, pre-rinsing said stains.

Wings of bombers disassembled, any bombs they did manage to launch being picked apart on the way down. \n \n Militaries retreated to plot. They had the time.

      "**Living The Dream** \n \n \n What is the dream? \n \n How can we live it on nothing but maxed out credit cards? \n \n Friend, these are the questions we're here to answer today. Let's start with the Dream. Contrary to what a lot of old people might think, the Dream has nothing to do with working hard, saving money, and giving our kids a better future than the shitty childhoods we had growing up. Let's be honest, that kind of Dream is crap. No, instead the Dream involves poor planning, heavy drinking, and flagrant irresponsibility. That, my friend, is the Dream : the real deal, the genuine article. \n \n Which means now we can move on to the next question : given our crappy credit scores, how can we live this Dream? Easy : other people's good credit. Good credit doesn't actually do anyone any good ; it's only the window where good credit turns bad that's worth living in. \n \n Shall we open that window, then? Good. Steal someone's wallet? Fine. Feel the inviting breeze, that cool air on our hot, flushed faces? Yes. \n \n Finally we can stop running, if only for a moment, from all the creditors who call us daily to harass us on paying them what we owe. Finally we can start living again. We can unplug the phone. We can sit in the dark. We can sip on the bottle of bourbon we bought with one of the credit cards in the wallet we stole. We don't have to think about that, though, just like we don't have to think about the fact that all the credit cards in that wallet will most likely be canceled by tomorrow. \n \n No, all we have to do is lay here on the bathroom floor, feel the Dream coursing through our veins, and be reassured by the fact that no matter how cold the tile and grout may feel, we are living the Dream. \n \n We are, after all, in the dark. \n \n Don't all dreams happen in t",

But in a flash, it came back to him, ``I knew this day was coming, but I ignored it. I knew it deep down, like a whisper in my ear, what the symbol on my arm meant. Damn it. Damn it.. DAMN IT!'' he thought. He always had two set of memories, but he brushed it off as a psychological disorder, as the other set of memories that has never felt like it belong to him anyway. But Alyshe knew, that girl who found him and kept fallowing around, saying he was last hope they had, she knew about it. Scott thought she must have been a nutcase that has heard of his condition and being the nutcase she is she believed it, but he was wrong, those man that attacked him on the highway knew about it as well. \n \n He tried to recall something from his second set of memories, he was a soldier.. no he was something like a defender.

      "When Dr. Victor Kleinner published his unassuming paper on what he called'DNA decompilers', hundreds of entrepreneurs, programmers, researchers and more went on a mad dash for glory, in hopes of doing the impossible : creating a computer program that could translate the four letter binary of life genetic information into a understandable computer language. The first early, if buggy success was Isaac Lee's 50,000 line epic of assembly that took 20 years of hard work to wright, compile, and make a machine that could run it, he became fabulously wealthy. Using decompiler software, researchers could analyze small parts of genetic code, and understand it for the first time in its history. Now, 50 years later, many companies from Microsoft to Oracle have made their own decompilers and have carved out a hectic market for medical research and genetic augments. Not all have embraced this change, preferring a more fastidious approach. Most, if not all of these programs were proprietary and no on",

Today, I have found his current manifestation. \n \n It was very cold the morning I got to meet my creator. His guards had frisked me at the door and quickly ushered me into a study where God himself sat in an old leather armchair across from a dying fireplace. There was a chair adjacent to his which was out of place in his study but had obviously been placed there for my benefit. Without invitation, I crossed the study and sat down in the vacant chair and began to warm my hands by the fire. God watched me silently from across the room, his face unreadable. Finally after an eternity, I broke the silence. \n \n ``Why? Why this form?'' I asked him coldly with growing contempt in my voice. ``How can this manifestation possibly help humanity?'' At first he didn't answer. God sat across the room staring through me, his thoughts a million miles away and after what seemed like an eternity, he s",

I hummed the solo from Frozen as I drew on my reflection in the condensation, adding first a pair of ample breasts, then some bunny ears. I made a kissy face and fluttered my eyelashes. Suddenly a roaring noise filled my ears and the bathroom plunged into gloom.

Have a word goal in mind before you start writing. I will usually aim to write 2,000 words a session - that gives me a 50k word novel in 25 days! Even a 500 word a day goal still gets you a novel in under 4 months. \n 2. Remove distractions. Check out apps like Write or Die, or even turn off your internet connection for the writing time. You can also find apps that block access to certain sites for a length of time ( like turning off Reddit...). \n 3. Use a timer! I personally am a fan of the Pomodoro method - 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off. Great for writing intensely without getting burned out. \n 4. Find a writing group!

Entirely up to you,'' the man in brown said. \n \n A pregnant pause filled the small room behind the bar. The single light hanging low overhead left the corners obscured in shadow.

Knocked the pack, and placed one between his lips. ``You know a therapist ",

He was sitting on a tree stump holding the weapon that was to cause destruction beyond their beliefs. The first four ran out at him. The first of the four pulled his blade from the scabbard in a long sweeping motion. The first man fell, a hole in his eye. Second down from a hole in the chest. Jim ran at the third. He pushed off of him and stabbed the fourth in the eye before pushing off again and throwing the deadly weapon. The tip embedded itself inside the third mans chest. Chaos ensued. Man number five came with two katanas. Jim ducked as man six swung the claymore over his head. The butt of Jim's weapon hit the sharp side of the claymore, rebounding it into man seven. Man five swung again, and Jim jumped off of his blade and stabbed him in the neck. Number six wrenched the claymore from seven, only to get a hole in the back of his neck. One by one the men fell.

The crowd had dispersed at the sight of the gun, and he could suddenly hear sirens wailing above the pounding of his chest. \n \n Out of ideas, he slowly shuffled his feet to turn his last one hundred eighty degrees. \n \n As Jordan ’ s head slowly caught up with his shoulders, the face of his father came into view. Jordan squinted his eyes at the glint of the streetlights off of the Glock in his father ’ s hand. \n \n “ Open your eyes, son, ” his father said. His words struck Jordan surprisingly softly, almost fatherly, given the patricidal gravity of the situation. The son laughed at the thought. \n \n “ I have every reason to blow your brains out ",

This was our purpose, and why few of us felt a want to settle down. Our natural and emergent design was not being utilized. * \n \n *I sent word to as many as I could find through trusted messengers. We convened in Italy, just before the plague would spread into the rest of Europe. It was decided that we would do what was our instinct. To feed, but to comfort the humans.

We became what you call Plague Doctors. * \n \n *While the medical advancements made by humans are absolutely commendable, and did save many lives at the time, it did not save all of those that were spared.

A small bit landed on his shoulder, standing out among the pale white skin. \n \n The farm owner stepped to him, singling him out from all the volunteers. It wasn't hard to find him, no human stood within a dozen yards of him. \n \n Most humans were too scared to approach. The farmer spoke. ``Shade.'' \n \n Gan switched his thoughts from work to speech, shovel dropping, back relaxing. \n \n ``You know the worlds fucked when the shades help out.'' Gan dipped his head to the human, a sign of respect. The man hesitated then returned the gesture, likely unaware of the importance of his deeper bow. He grabbed the fallen shovel and handed it back, apparently so used to switching thought patterns that he didn't have to adjust. \n \n The farmer pulled a long shirt from the pack on his back and threw it to Gan. It landed on his shoulder, above the dirt. He then pulled the shovel off his back and began digging a trench beside Gan. ``It'd be nice to have you fight with us. One of you can change the tide.'' \n \n ``Yes.'' Gan replied. He was still in speech thought, unable to dig. After it became clear the farmer was only going to dig, Gan switched to work thought, straightening his back and putting on the shirt. The relief from the burning sun was instant, though his neck still ached. He began digging. \n \n How long had it been since he'd been in battle thought? Gan worked as he thought, digging the trench he would soon die in. Even the strongest shades had died out against those... *things*. \n \n Demons. \n \n The humans were foolish in many things, but they knew what to call these things. \n \n Gan kept digging, ignoring the now-approaching volunteers, more comfortable after the farmer got s",

The woman was covered in the robes of the east. Lots of jewellery and earrings. And a nose ring. Unusual for these parts. She was pretty. Young by the looks of it. Her head was covered but her hair was thick and black. She looked quite healthy. She stretched forward her hands with her head down and offered forth a bowl of steaming substance. \n \n ``Hmm.'' I took a spoon and dipped it into the frothy mix. Looked gross. I after taking a whiff i sampled some of it with my tongue. Snake Venom. Asp specifically, that was obvious right from the top but there was more. Strychnine, Belladonna. Yup. Henbane too probably. And also something else that i couldn't quite put my finger on. I looked at the woman. She had raised her head and was staring at me innocently. She probably didn't know what it was. The bowl was more full of poison than whatever food it was meant to masquerade as. Somebody was setting her up. Why? As a message. but for who. I stared at her intently. There was a tattoo on the side of her neck mostly covered by her hair and cowl. \n \n ``Well Dagrun?'' The king grunted impatiently. \n \n ``Uhhhhhhhhh.... Yeah.... Checks out.

You look at your watch. 11:02. Tasteful Replicas is closed. You take a breath of manufactured confidence and approach the man. As you get closer you see that he's holding something in his palm. An open fob watch. You're right next to him but he doesn't seem to notice. \n You turn to the painting. The Starry Night. \n ``No need to be upset. It'll still be here tomorrow,'' you say, reassuringly. You take another peek at the fob. The metal is worn and discolored, the swirling designs faded.

Each were dated from September 20th to the 24th, which was today. \n \n Starting with the first one, the 20th, I cut open the envelope. The contents fall out of it. A card, reading ``There''. I shake the envelope, hoping for more. There is none. I turned over the card, only to find it blank, so I presumed it was a message with the rest of the contents combined. I cut open the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd envelopes, and displayed the cards next to each other in chronological order. \n \n It was all making sense now. Hands shaking, palms sweating, I cut open the last envelope, and shake out the card.

Why did I still breathe? ``WELL.....GET ON WITH IT FOOL'', roared the dragon, slowly crawling to his feet. I began to move....swinging mightily with my sword, to no effect. The beast was now fully awake, and his roars were deafening. No matter what I hit him with, nothing made so much as a scratch on his great skin... and then I remember the tooth. Pulling it from my pouch, I waited until the beast was at eye level and then jammed it into the spot right between his eyes. He screamed....a scream that only a beast from hell itself could scream. As he fell, he looked at me one last time with what almost seemed to be sadness in his eyes, and said ``Kill me if you wish, but please... never let her come to harm''... and with that, he shuddered and gave one last sigh and was gone. \n \n ``Well it's about damn time'' came a sharp, shrill voice from behind.

It would be best if she remained there. If she just stayed there, we could stay together. I would even slip her food and water under the door if she was good.

      "KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's order to ban immigrants and refugees for 90 days and all visitors for 120 days has caused widespread concern in Afghanistan but at least one local government expects more donations in response to the ban.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump walks with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (R) and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly (L) as they meet with Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., January 27, 2017. REUTERS/Jim Bourg\n\nAfghan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the U.S. executive order did not impact the country politically because most Afghan people did not like it and were in favor of a better economic relationship with the United States that would help Afghan forces.\n\n\"The Americans know it, but the Afghans ... are very thankful for every gesture of goodwill from America,\" Abbasi told Reuters at an informal news conference with his foreign minister.\n\n\"I hope it will be reflected on our donation of aid, I hope America will continue to offer the support and the cooperation towards Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nThe ban was due to start on Thursday but was put on hold when Trump's administration was told last week that a federal court in Washington state had put the ban on hold.\n\nSeveral U.S Senators, including Republican Bob Corker, a Tennessee senator, and Democrat Chris Coons, a Delaware senator, said the administration should quickly re-instate the travel ban and get the courts to overturn an earlier decision that allowed Trump to put the ban on hold.\n\nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment on whether it would revise the ban, given that the appeal of the March court order was upheld.\n\nTrump signed the order on Friday after making the case in a speech at a military academy in Florida.\n\nHe said the move was needed to improve vetting and national security after a failed attempt earlier this year by Washington to send in tens of thousands of extra troops to fight insurgents, including members of the Haqqani network.\n\nThe ban applies indefinitely to most immigrants from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nIt also suspends the refugee program for 120 days.\n\nAbbasi said the ban should not affect the Afghan people who were not citizens or had permanent resident rights in the United States, or the people who had entered the United States as refugees.\n\nHe said the government had not received any complaints from American citizens. He said he was happy that a court had said a 90-day ban on immigrants could not go into effect unless it can be justified with good reasons.\n\n\"Even if I disagree, it is better than the alternative, which is the ban on entering Afghanistan at all, for a long period of time,\" he said\n\nIn another sign of the international criticism and concern this ban has caused, the German foreign ministry summoned an Afghan ambassador to express objections to the order. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had expressed concern about the ban last week. [nL2N1O24Q5]\n\nWashington accused the government of Kabul of harboring militants and the Afghan government had made clear it had no intention of doing so. On Thursday, Afghan security forces conducted a raid to free a militant leader.\n\n\"It is extremely regrettable that the Afghan government continues to harbor terrorist elements. And so all efforts are on our side to counter that,\" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.\n\nU.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the ban would not affect efforts to combat ISIS, the militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL, which has been fighting Western forces in Afghanistan for years and is a bitter enemy of the Taliban.\n\nSome countries will take less of a hit from the ban than others, he said, adding that the United States would continue to focus its efforts on ISIS's \"core\" regions in Syria and Iraq.",

      "In a few years, the U.S. will be in the dark ages if the new Republican Congress repeals Obamacare, says Bernie Sanders.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley famously said that healthcare would be the \"most important issue\" when President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. When the next Congress convenes, there will be only a handful of health-care-related items on the congressional agenda, including a House vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. As it stands, only one Republican and zero Democrats support the bill. That fact alone should send a clear message that Republicans may not have anywhere near a majority in the Senate when the legislative body convenes on January 3, 2017.\n\nAs Democrats' majority in the Senate is at stake, Sanders has been quick to draw a political contrast between himself and his Democratic counterpart. \"If the most important issue when the Republicans get back is to take health care away from 16 million people and slash Medicaid … that's all the reason it makes sense for the Democratic Party to mobilize and fight back,\" he told the Progressive Change Campaign Committee during a campaign stop in Iowa.\n\nYet even if a majority of Senate Republicans were to reject the legislation, Sanders argues that healthcare and other issues that make up the bulk of the agenda of the Senate's second-leading party, are important enough to merit the time, attention, and attention that Democrats are demanding. \"If the Senate Democrats really want to win back the House and win back the presidency in 2020, then we have to have the kind of grassroots campaign that we see in the fight for $15, $12, or $15 an hour,\" he told the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. If voters turn up in the tens of millions to vote this November in the largest wave of opposition to Trump and Republicans in American history, perhaps Democrats will be able to \"win back control of the Senate in 2020 and a majority in the House that makes a real difference,\" he added.\n\nWhile some on the Left have questioned his position, Sanders has insisted not only that health care and other issues directly affected by an incoming Congress can have lasting political significance, but that the 2016 election demonstrated that the American people are hungry for such policies. \"They are sick and tired of establishment politics and establishment economics, yet the billionaires are doing phenomenally well and getting richer and richer while the majority of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, in some cases in poverty, and when they do have jobs they are working for starvation wages,\" he said. \"And now what is happening is the Republicans are trying to cut social services by the billions and we're talking about cutting Medicaid, Medicare, public housing, food stamps, public education, and child programs. You are not cutting them unless the Republicans have a majority in Congress – you're cutting them, when there is a unified Democratic majority in Congress and you have a majority of the American people who stand up, are ready to stand up and fight back.\"\n\n\"If a whole generation sees what has happened to social services here, how will they react when it happens to them? And that's the reason they're looking for big ideas,\" he explained, before launching into a broad critique of the Republican Party. \"What we are seeing is a small number of billionaires dominating the Republican primary and a tiny fraction of the Republican electorate is determining which of the other candidates they're going to nominate to go head-to-head with the billionaire. That's wrong, and that's got to be rejected on a whole host of issues,\" he argued.\n\nWhat's more, Sanders warned, if Trump's agenda gets carried over to Congress – as he is already promising, regardless of which party controls the White House – the Trump administration will not only gut health care to Americans, but will further \"dismantle the Affordable Care Act [ACA], cut Social Security, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, make it much more difficult for the middle class and the poor in this country to get by, and make enormous corporate profits.\"\n\n\"We are going through one of my favorite parables of the year,\" Sanders noted. \"If it's true what Donald Trump is saying, if it's true what he's proposing with regard to health care, why would there be a Republican in the White House?\"\n\nEven if Trump were to veto the GOP plans to dismantle Obamacare or, to put it more bluntly, abolish it, the bill will die – because the Republican Party base demands it to, as Sanders sees it – on the floor of the House. But if Democrats win the House and Senate majorities in 2018, in turn giving Democrats majority control in the White House and the U.S. Congress, Sanders believes his agenda – which he described as the \"common sense\" of an America in which workers earn a livable wage and have healthcare – will have significant potential for passage.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that we are coming to an historic moment,\" he told the progressive group at a campaign rally in Iowa.",

      "As I have previously written, the reason I decided to quit eating meat was because I wanted to be more environmentally friendly. This is a worthy goal. As I explained, my rationale was that I had no good alternatives to meat aside from farm animals. There are some things we can do, however, that don't involve going to the farm, but do help improve the world.\n\nTo find out how I did it, I talked to a lot of experts. For the uninitiated, the \"consensus panel\" at a conference is a fairly big deal. It's kind of like a government panel; they all meet and have a very serious discussion about some major environmental issues and come up with a consensus statement. You can even add to it.\n\nI knew of the consensus panels before but had the impression that they always took two or three months or so to formulate and publish, and it was never very exciting. At conference they typically had a speaker with two to three minutes of talk and then it was all very quiet. However, with this one, the consensus had the last minute added on.\n\n\nOn February 21 the panel presented their report to the Ecotech 2050 Alliance. As they are a new group that is new to the food system, it took several months to develop a final report. They then published it on their website for everyone to read, and now that you know it's just a single issue document, it's possible to look at it and start to understand the process much more easily.\n\nIt's also a very long document (over 300 pages). This would probably be the kind of thing that a book or academic paper would have. It's not going to take a month or two to read a paper.\n\nBut it is not.\n\nI found all this overwhelming. In the process of reading there were so many questions asked about everything that I'm going to try to answer in a section called \"Actions You Can Take to Help Reduce Food Waste.\"\n\nBefore we start, let me be clear about one thing: I don't think there's any moral issue with eating meat. As I've said, I did not quit eating meat because of a desire to stop wasting resources. I quit because I wanted to feel better about the world, and I realized that eating meat was not going to stop that. In fact, I believe it was my biggest single source of waste. This was especially difficult, as I had been trying to reduce my meat consumption for many years. After about 10 years, I gave up meat completely when I started to feel very unwell from all the dairy and eggs. When I saw what this was becoming of me, I was at a point where I had nothing left to give.\n\nI didn't know that I was going to become vegetarian until I gave up meat. That was the end and before I knew it I had turned vegan. I've gotten plenty of questions about it on some of the websites that I write for. Some people want to know when I was on a vegetarian diet and some people want to ask why I didn't give up meat (and I'll even mention some meatless days). This article doesn't really address that question for me; people want to know what changes have I made that gave me such a massive change in my health.\n\nBut I do think it's worth describing in detail what's happening in an ideal world, a scenario that I envision for the next 50 years. I'll call it \"The World Is Not Enough.\" I believe that we'll be able to feed everyone, but that will not happen at the cost of a lot of suffering for a lot of animals and a lot of resources. On the other hand, if we have to overproduction and we have to keep eating animals instead of producing food, we will have to overpopulate the Earth with people so we can have enough food to feed everyone.\n\nI will also use it to illustrate how difficult it is to do something that I have previously said I wanted to do; which is to help the world live more efficiently. I want to change the way we think about the efficiency of feeding people. We currently produce about 4 times as much of our food as we need (and have been for years). And we can grow about 8 times as much food as we currently do.\n\nThe number that I use is 4 X 8 = 240 tons of food per year. This is about 1 lb (0.454 kg) of animal protein per day. This is what we could realistically produce by eating what we currently consume, which is not even the absolute minimum of what we should consume. The average adult from New York consumes about 5 lbs (2.19 kg) of protein per day. If we take this into account, we will find that we need to eat at least 250 lbs (113 kg) of protein per day in order for all the food that we currently produce to be safe from a nutritional standpoint.\n\nIt turns out that it's actually quite",

      "A new survey by the Pew Research Center finds that many Americans worry a great deal about being able to afford their health care in the near future and that they prefer some form of universal health coverage as a solution to this problem.\n\nIn a recent national telephone survey, conducted June 3-5 among 1,010 adults, 36 percent said that they worried a great deal about being able to afford their health care if they needed it this year. Just over a third (37%) said they worried a great deal that they would \"still be paying medical bills if they got sick.\" Just 12 percent said they did not worry much about being able to have health care for medical reasons.\n\nThese results are virtually unchanged from the last time Pew Research asked a similar poll in November 2013. As with the November survey, a substantial minority (33%) of Americans said they worried a great deal about medical insurance costs this year, a figure that has declined by 10 percentage points since 2007.\n\nIn addition, a narrow majority of those in the public say that they prefer universal health coverage without any additional restrictions or requirements on coverage for medical reasons (54%) over a plan that offers some amount of coverage but with some restrictions or requirements that apply to coverage for medical reasons (49%). This is similar to what was reported by a November 2013 survey and is not new.\n\nIn addition to the significant concern about being able to afford health care this year, there is a substantial gap in views of how well the Affordable Care Act has performed. About eight-in-ten Americans (85%) say that the Affordable Care Act is working well, while a majority (57%) say that it's not working well. In November 2013, the ACA was seen as an overwhelming success by more than six-in-ten (62%) Americans. Even in the November poll, 43% said that the ACA was working fairly well. A slightly narrower majority (53%) said that the AHCA is working and 48% said that the AHCA is not working.\n\nThe majority of Americans who say the Affordable Care Act is working well say that they disapprove of the way the law has evolved since 2010. Nearly half (48%) say that they disapprove of how the health law has changed over time, more than double the percentage who said this in November 2013. Similarly, a large majority of Americans who say the Affordable Care Act is not working well disapprove of the way the law has changed in recent years.\n\nPartisan differences in views of the health law have widened. Roughly four-in-ten Republicans (40%) say that the Affordable Care Act is not working well, compared with 34% of Democrats. Similarly, about three-quarters of independents (76%) and Democrats (80%) say the ACA is not working well.\n\nOn the issue of the Affordable Care Act, Americans are considerably more divided along political lines over the question of whether the law should be repealed altogether. Fewer than half of Republicans (48%) and Democrats (49%) support repealing the entire law on the basis that it is too costly or not working. More than seven-in-ten independents (73%) and more than six-in-ten registered voters not affiliated with either major party (62%) favor repealing the law because it's not working or because it's too expensive.",
      "It's only six weeks until the election. But that's not slowing down anyone who's had it with Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, and plans to get as much political action on their ballot as possible.\n\nThe first-day-of-election period, which runs from Labor Day through Nov. 2, is known as The Ballot Access Week to voters who have been waiting since before Trump came on the scene to get their votes counted.

Many have formed online organizations that can host \"direct action\" that can cause a problem for anyone, particularly during the election season.\n\n\"Direct action\" can include a whole host of political protests or activism that, while usually peaceful, can be disruptive and intimidating to politicians and staff, who may have security and surveillance people at the door.\n\nOrganized by The People's Action, the most visible organizations are calling for an overhaul to electoral laws and practices, for the \"immediate and orderly dismissal\" of special counsel Robert Mueller, and for a complete reform of how laws for getting money and other assistance for political campaigns are enforced.\n\nThe organizers have formed a new website, TheDemocracyIsForPeople.com, where they encourage readers to join a march on Washington for the full repeal of Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in which the court declared that limits on independent advocacy groups by corporations and unions did not violate the First Amendment's free-speech clause.\n\nThe Trump administration would love for the Citizens United ruling to be reversed. President Trump even declared last month that he would consider appointing a new justice, Neil Gorsuch, who wrote the majority opinion reversing the case.\n\nThe organizers are hoping that even if the march does not happen, they will be able to draw more people to their social media campaigns about the election. The campaign is being coordinated on the internet, by people who do not have to go through an official organization to do so.\n\n\"If you live in one of these targeted states where there is an office that you can go to and see, go tell the folks there about it, tell the people who you know about it,\" said one organizer.",
      "In May, the FBI released \"The Hillary Clinton E-mail Investigation,\" a heavily redacted version of the report the bureau released in April on its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. While the e-mails released in May include some information previously released on the FBI's website, like the names of e-mail users and their e-mail metadata, many details are hidden behind blacked-out text, including the identities of the individuals who sent and received Clinton's messages.\n\nWhile the e-mail investigation that resulted in FBI director James Comey not recommending criminal charges against Clinton has been over for three months, the FBI's FOIA website reveals more information about Clinton that has not yet been released. (You can peruse the FBI's e-mail archive, which was first posted two years ago, here.)\n\nOne e-mail sent by Abedin in March 2008 is classified \"Secret,\" according to the Justice Department's e-mail disclosure policies. A second e-mail sent by Sullivan in January 2009 is classified \"Special Access Program,\" the same \"Secret\" grade as the e-mail released by Comey. The third e-mail sent by Abedin is classified \"Confidential,\" which is the same level of classification as classified information on the WikiLeaks Vault 7 series of documents, released by the organization in October. The fact that there may be more classified information in Abedin's e-mail archive, and the FBI hasn't made it available to FOIA requesters, means that, at minimum, Abedin had a degree of access to classified information that Comey concluded wasn't sufficient to merit criminal charges against her.\n\nIt's not clear whether she's been interviewed by the FBI. In the meantime, what's revealed about Abedin's e-mail server is that it was run on an outdated version of Microsoft Windows, allowing unauthorized data to \"move among the devices within the domain, possibly even from device to device,\" the FBI concluded in October. The FBI also found \"no evidence that Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest update in the investigation follows the release of tens of thousands of e-mails to the Benghazi Select Committee earlier this week. Some of those e-mails, released through a Freedom of Information Act request, show that Clinton did not have a State Department e-mail address. But the FBI notes that Clinton and her staff used the same device for both personal and work e-mail. And, again, the FBI notes that \"no security controls are in place to prevent unclassified material from being transmitted on an unclassified personal system.\"",
      "It is a rare thing to see this.\n\nA player, so talented, has lost the plot so completely. His actions have gone too far in one direction for him to continue with this strategy, and he now cannot seem to return to that direction from which he came.\n\nThere is a reason why he had to start in 2013. And there is a reason that the 2014-14 campaign looks a lot more promising than the 2015-16 campaign.\n\nKessel got so much heat for his role when he first got to Toronto. Players were saying \"well his offensive numbers were down.\" Players were saying \"he was too slow to score.\" Other players weren't happy with where Kessel was fitting in.\n\nIn 2013, Kessel had the NHL's best Corsi rating. In 2014, he had arguably the best Corsi number in the entire league since he had become a permanent healthy scratch in 2013-14. In 2015-16, his Corsi was second in the entire league as he started playing more and getting more ice time, which made him an even better possession player.\n\nThis past season, Kessel started out on fire scoring 27 goals. In the early going of 2015-16 he had 21. Over the final 30 games which he went off for 17 goals, however he saw his Corsi drop to 44.5%.\n\nKessel isn't really on the ice as much as he once was. He is not getting the offensive zone starts he once did and he's not looking as creative in creating offense. His shot attempts have also decreased dramatically, from 25.4% of all shots taken in 2014-15 to 20.4% last year, to a mere 14.6% in 2015-16.\n\nYou can attribute a lot of that to an offensive-zone turnover rate which was up in 2014-15. But there is more to the declining Corsi numbers.\n\nCorsi is a player's ability to get an expected value of shot attempts on goal. In other words, what if an average player with average shot quality could play at a higher pace and get more total shot attempts in a game than a scoring superstar can? If those two players take the same amount of shots into the NHL shot-suppression machine, their expected shot production will be the same.\n\nWith a Corsi of 44.5%, Kessel does a better job than ever with limiting the amount of shots that find their way into the net.\n\nThis is a fantastic trait to possess.\n\nFor a small sample size there have been other players in this past season who were more successful at limiting shots, such as Brad Marchand and Alex Ovechkin. But these are really small sample types and they're not very helpful if you're trying to determine what type of impact Kessel is having on limiting shots and playing with more creativity.\n\nThere are many reasons for Kessel having such a big drop from 2014-15 to 2015-16. The most notable one is that his shot quality dropped a fair amount. His shot attempt rate was a little higher than the league average as he was playing more, but he went from a Corsi of 50.5 in 2014-15 to 45.5% in 2015-16, which will hurt his overall shot suppression, at least for now.\n\nHis shot attempts were better, but they had a smaller effect.\n\nAnother one, which is quite important for Kessel considering he's playing so many shorthanded minutes, is that he hasn't changed the number of shots he takes. He is getting just as many shots from more dangerous spots that he has in the past so his ability to limit shots has not decreased dramatically.\n\nThis would be an excellent explanation for the drop in Corsi numbers. Kessel is taking fewer shots than a player of comparable talent would have on the same ice time.\n\nHere is where the Kessel numbers can be better explained and improved. The last couple of seasons, Kessel has seen his 5v5 CF% get more and more favorable. This means that if you look at his 5v5 CF% from 2014-15 to 2015-16, you would expect it to get more and more favourable. It did not.\n\nTo put it mildly, Kessel's team has not been the most efficient one at 5v5 hockey.\n\nAnd that is exactly why he has seen his 5v5 CF% get more favourable over the past two seasons. He is not getting to the open ice. He is not getting to the right spots in the offensive zone.\n\nHere is a visual to illustrate how much Kessel has changed his linemates and in turn the players around him. The lines that Kessel has played are labeled by position:\n\n2014-2015: Kessel centering Matthews-Malkin-Gorges.\n\n2015-2016: Kessel centering Kadri-Eichel-Weagle.\n\nThe numbers for",

      "TRAVERSE CITY -- The Detroit Red Wings have had two chances to take a playoff series against the Washington Capitals, but haven't gotten any closer.\n\nBut the Red Wings made sure they wouldn't get away without finishing the job on Friday.\n\nZach Nastasiuk scored the first goal of his NHL career, Henrik Zetterberg got the game-winning one-timer, and the Red Wings beat their opponents 2-1.\n\nWashington coach Barry Trotz called the goal a power-play goal when the puck went off his stick. And his players aren't buying it.\n\n\"That's what we're good at, we're good at turning pucks over as a team,\" Capitals forward Andre Burakovsky said. \"That's what we did. The other team's good at scoring goals, it's a good thing. We should score more, it's a good thing because we're good at it. He just didn't do a great job of turning it over.\"\n\nDetroit defenseman Mike Green said his line has been giving up a lot of chances lately. He said after the game the Capitals know what it means to give up a prime scoring chance.\n\n\"We had a great opportunity, but all of a sudden they're up on us a little bit -- and it wasn't just one,\" Green said.\n\nGoalie Jimmy Howard stopped 18 of 19 shots in his first start since April. He made 24 saves in a double-overtime win in Chicago three days ago before getting the news he wouldn't be pitching again.\n\n\"I think it's always about confidence for me,\" Howard said of playing against the Wings. \"It doesn't matter what I do in practice or what I do on the ice if you're up by two or two-and-a-half goals I have to focus on these minutes. Hopefully you're going to have these types of games. We've had enough these past two or three games in a row.\"\n\nTrotz said Howard's confidence is fine, he just doesn't want to have to rely on his performance against Detroit this season.\n\n\"Jimmy's made a lot of big saves for us, big games against some really good teams,\" Trotz said. \"Just want to keep those confidence up, let him get through these few ones where he's not going to get that game in a row. We're going to put him out there and let him have those tough games, but I mean he can definitely do that.\"\n\nNastasiuk was playing with Henrik Zetterberg when the puck went off of his skate and into the net.\n\n\"I just tried to give him the confidence that just like when he was younger, I used to give him the confidence to do it as well,\" Nastasiuk said. \"He scored, that's good, that's a great power play goal.\"",

      "Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford threw a pass in the Lions' loss to the Steelers Sunday because he thought a ball had deflected off his left shoulder and into the end zone, his first such pass since Dec. 9, 2006; the last time he threw a pass like that was in a preseason game.\n\nStafford was sacked by Steelers right tackle Marcus Gilbert. On his own 32-yard line, Stafford scrambled for 7 yards to the Linc, where he threw a quick-slant deep in Steelers territory. The Steelers defense then stopped Stafford's run for a four-yard loss. But the pass was incomplete.\n\nStafford missed the next five games with a broken fibula, missing a Lions win over Chicago on Dec. 22. He came to the sideline that day to tell coach Jim Schwartz that he thought a ball had deflected off his left shoulder.\n\n\"Staffinty said something like, 'Coach, I'm good,'\" Schwartz said. \"That's what we call it in that locker room. If he thinks there's something out of the ordinary out there, it's not a good thing but it's a great thing if he can just be more aware of it.\"\n\nThe Lions are 0-8 when Stafford is injured, and Schwartz's assessment was a bit different on a couple of other plays Sunday. On a fourth-and-1 at the Pittsburgh 42-yard line, Stafford had one last chance to get the ball downfield in time.\n\nIt was third-and-3, so the Lions knew he had to pick up at least six yards. But on the right hash, at the Pittsburgh 17-yard line, Stafford hesitated, looking like he might try to keep the play alive in case he lost the snap. He was then hit from behind by outside linebacker Jarvis Jones, who also had a sack.\n\nHad Stafford held the ball long enough, there was a chance he at least had a chance to get in the end zone. But he had no idea whether the Steelers had a good coverage on rookie cornerback Ross Cockrell, forcing Stafford inside. So he scrambled for 7 yards before being tackled for no gain.\n\nThe play was one of many that made Stafford appear unprepared for some of the high-stakes matchups the Lions are usually asked to play. He said he's only going to try those shots if they're needed. He still said he'll try to throw deep downfield, but only when he's sure he is making the right read.\n\n\"My main focus is to play well every single time I take the field,\" he said. \"And if we don't get the ball, I'll do what I always do. Just go play great football.\"\n\n---\n\nFollow David Mayo on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/David_Mayo",

Dirt Jumping is played while jumping, and is often used to set up kills for players. Each player has three jump distances between themselves and the closest enemy, and they can only jump a single distance from another teammate. The number after the range is how much jump distance an enemy would block, or how much the player can extend his jump distance.

      "In the world of software innovation, the future is one of constant change. One of the most critical shifts that software developers, and users alike, will experience in the next few years will be the shift from the traditional model of software development towards a more agile development model. In this article, we'll look at how developers can make themselves comfortable and proficient in adopting these new frameworks and practices in the process of building software systems.\n\nThere are quite a few software development patterns that are considered to be \"keystones\" of software development. These common development patterns are most often discussed in the context of software development methodologies, and in particular they tend to focus on specific tools, technologies and frameworks used as part of the traditional development framework. These patterns are not necessarily required components in an agile product development process, but they are helpful to understand the underlying philosophy underlying agile software development.\n\nA typical developer would look at these patterns in the context of an \"ideas pipeline\" for building software systems based on the idea that they are a starting point to further experimentation and exploration. However, in this article we're going to focus on how developers adopt agile development practices in the world of developing software systems. There aren't specific tools or technologies that are essential. Instead, these patterns lend themselves well to the agile development methodologies. In order to fully embrace this agile model, you'll have to get comfortable with these different approaches and practices.\n\nWhat is agile?\n\nThe agile development process was first introduced by Eric Evans and his colleague, Ken Schwaber. The concept of agile development came out with their book, Six Revolutions for Software Developers that was released in 1996. In their book, they explain the terms agile and waterfall using this diagram:\n\nIn their description of agile development, they defined it as an \"extensible model of developing software to meet customer needs.\" In other words, in terms of traditional methodologies, what makes an agile development process unique is that it allows the development team to iterate much faster than the traditional model.\n\nAgile development involves a development process whereby the team moves along a \"development trajectory\" as they move along the way from \"vision down to code.\" This development path does not have a defined goal or destination.\n\nAs the developer works on the software system they create it towards each of the six key steps described above. Each key component of the software system has a different life cycle. The longer that it takes to complete step 2 (i.e. step 1 of this development pathway) and the less that is working, the longer the software development cycle tends to be. The goal is to make the life cycle as fast and full as possible.\n\nThe developers in an agile team typically follow a workflow where:\n\nThere is a sprint cycle that typically lasts 1-6 weeks (a longer cycle may be used if an ongoing problem or problem domain needs to be addressed).\n\nThese sprint cycles can be broken down to smaller steps.\n\nThis development cycle is considered to be iterative with a goal that can be met by the end of the development cycle.\n\nThis development cycle can be completed within a few days if an iteration is needed for implementation.\n\nThis development pipeline is considered to be an important part of agile development because it increases the time-to-production and makes it much easier for the customer to get support, if things go wrong. However, agile development is important for another reason, as it enables the developers in an agile team to iterate much faster than their traditional methodologies.\n\nWhat is an agile development cycle?\n\nWhat is a typical agile development cycle? If you want to do the job right in the real world, one that enables you to learn new things quickly and without fear of taking too much time or missing the next big \"idea\" in a row, you'll have to follow an agile development cycle. Here are a few different stages that we typically see in an agile development team.\n\nFeature development\n\nIn order to deliver new features to the user and to develop a stable and sustainable product/market fit, the developers in an agile development team work from a feature development direction to a system-level feature. This is when a piece of software is fully integrated into the user's environment. At this stage, the software system's implementation is considered complete and it is often considered that the software has reached the final stage in it's long life cycle and that is, it's integration into the user's environment.\n\nUser Stories\n\nWe all know what a user story is, but most of the software in a typical company is usually developed by a bunch of different teams that create them in different modules. At this stage, the developers need to define new users that need to be accommodated in the software and create a set of business rules that need to be implemented.\n\nIterations\n\nIt is not unusual that we see iterations of the initial features as the feature is being built, especially if the development team is still working",
      "\"They had a lot of help getting here,\" he said. \"No one came up here by themselves.\"\n\nIn a small trailer behind a bank adjacent to the park is the first of its kind ever constructed on the U.S./Mexico border in Arizona.\n\nThe wall, built by the nonprofit Customs and Border Protection, will have solar panels to generate electricity, heat for hot showers and use a sewage collection system to treat human poop before moving it in the opposite direction as well, according to a CBP press release.\n\nThe wall is part \"of one of the largest new border construction projects in American history,\" said CBP director Kevin McAleenan. \"It symbolizes that the future of our relationship with Mexico is as important as the present.\"\n\nAs part of the wall, more than 5,000 miles of fencing will be constructed, with 2,000 meters of new \"infill.\"\n\nThe wall will prevent migrants from entering the United States, while simultaneously securing the border. The Trump administration believes that a wall alone will not stop the influx of immigrants. Instead, it plans to speed up the deportation process, increase Border Patrol manpower, and \"secure the border\" in a way that will discourage further immigration.\n\n\"The real challenge is enforcing our existing legal immigration system,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said. \"If you don't have people entering illegally into the United States, you don't have them coming through the border in the first place.\"\n\n\"It is just a great example of the incredible progress we've made. I think that when you look at recent news stories, we've really set a high standard and everybody wants to do well in the U.S.\"\n\nIn July 2011, a pair of Border Patrol agents approached a man who was hiding in the bushes along the U.S. side of the border. The migrants were attempting to cross on foot. The agents asked the man to remove his shoes, and when that proved insufficient, the agents kicked the man once, twice and once more in the knee while he was still trying to get away on his hands and knees.\n\nThe agents placed the man, then identified as Honduran national Carlos Guerena-Hernandez, in the holding cell to question him. The questioning was recorded in excruciating detail by a Border Patrol investigator, using the name John Kelly, who recorded the questioning in Spanish with a translator in the next cell over.\n\nAfter an hour, Guerena-Hernandez was finally put in handcuffs for the time being. He was charged with reentering the country illegally. He was released on $1,100.\n\n\"After that incident we stopped letting migrants through the desert that had such a low chance of being smuggled across the desert on their own,\" ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan told The Washington Post. \"For us, we always ask ourselves – what is stopping the migrants? And that was the answer to that.\n\n\"If it wasn't for our agents, there may not be any migrants entering the U.S. illegally today. We are doing our job, and that is protecting the homeland of this country.\"\n\nHOMELAND SECURITY IN TROUBLE? TRUMP BLASTS IMMIGRATION STATEMENT, SAYS CHAIN MIGRATION IS 'A MISSION' OF UNITED STATES 'POLITICAL FAMILIES'\n\nA new U.S. Department of Homeland Security report published in November found that nearly 42 percent of unaccompanied minors apprehended crossing the border from Mexico come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The report did not determine how many of them were from Mexico and how many had been there for at least 10 years.\n\nIn March, a new report found that U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended an undocumented immigrant and his family on the southern U.S. border nearly 30 times a month in the period covered in the report's report. More recently, U.S. Border Patrol arrested another undocumented immigrant and his family in April and May.\n\n\"Over the first five months [of the year] we arrested approximately 3,200 aliens on immigration violations,\" said acting ICE director Thomas Homan, \"and that was double what we did in the same period last year. If you include the families…that's nearly 4,000 individuals.\"\n\nIn the report entitled \"Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Actions,\" the report said that border enforcement costs are $12,074 and that the Border Patrol \"invested\" another $1,839 in \"other immigration enforcement efforts.\"\n\n\"We've stepped up arrests by more than 40% versus 2016,\" Homan said, \"and in fiscal year 2016 we seized nearly 710 vehicles, and that's in addition to the vehicles seized in fiscal year 2015 of over 400 vehicles.\"\n\nHowever, the Trump administration wants to expand the number of immigrant detention centers in order to detain more people, while simultaneously allowing immigration judges – who are supposed to",
      "By Michael Snyder.\n\nHow do you deal with the fact that you are a very wealthy man? I suppose it is possible to ignore the news of massive increases in the wealth of the top 1% and not allow your emotions to get the better of you. There is one way however, and that is to change the world as we know it.\n\nAs we have already seen, the richest 1% of the world's population owns as much wealth as the bottom 90%, yet nearly all of the country's wealth is kept outside of the American economy. If only we were able to create an economic system which put money into the pockets of the average American, there is absolutely no doubt that the top 1% would shrink as a percentage of the entire world's population.\n\nAs such, I have decided to do something about it. By working extremely hard on a website which makes it easy for people all all over the world to buy the stocks of the 1% on margin, I am now hoping to revolutionize the way that the 1% of the world makes large investments.\n\nWhen you go to the website www.Stock-X.com, you are taken to a page where you can click on each of the \"share classes\" that you would like to buy. When the \"Buy Shares\" button appears on each of the share classes, the shares that are being bought are actually shares in your own trading account. All stock trading is handled centrally by the company I work for, so the shares which I bought are owned by my broker, but I was able to buy them all without leaving my computer and thus without having to send them to my financial account.\n\nThis is important, because if you go to the website with an account already opened at your bank or brokerage, you would have to send everything over in the form of a wire from the broker to the broker as they will not let you cash out stock positions with a wire. With this system, I could then cash out my own trades and buy new shares from my broker, without having to worry about the wire issue.\n\nAs the website's founder told CNBC:\n\n\"When people start to take their money out of the market and don't want to trust the institutions that are entrusted with their money… they go to stock trading websites like ours.\"\n\nHow does Stock-X work?\n\nYou can buy as many stock shares of any of the companies listed on the website as you would like. However, each share, or stock, is not really very much, you can buy 1,000 shares of Tesla, for example, for $100 each. In this way you are going to be paying $100 for each of your shares as opposed to just being tied to an index fund that has the same price for each of the stocks. By buying in the right share class instead of buying the entire class, you can diversify your holdings and ensure that your financial future is not being tied to the stock market in the slightest.\n\nOne thing that I did have to mention is that you should be extremely careful about investing in the stock of public companies like Facebook. The stock of the company is currently up nearly 1000% in value, which is way out of proportion with the overall stock market of the country, and so we cannot recommend investing in the stock. However, there are ways that you can get around this. To do this, you would first have to buy shares with your private bank account or brokerage account. After each trade, you would deposit money into the broker's account which would then be then used to buy the shares from the stock market.\n\nThat is, you would be giving the broker 10% of the money you put in to buy the shares, and the broker would then deposit that 10% back into the account of the person who just placed their purchase order, and then you will deposit the money into your savings account, and then the money that is now in your savings account would be sent the account of the other person who had placed a buy order.\n\nTo do this would save you over 10%, but we were going to try this anyways. At the end of the day, this would be money that you would have to put into a separate savings account. That said, at this point I am still in a position where I would prefer that you not invest in public companies. Why? Because if something happens to the stock market, you will be absolutely wiped out by your losses, and if something happens to the world's financial system, you will lose the amount that you have already invested.\n\nStock-X.com\n\nThis is just one of those websites that would be completely free to anyone that would want to use it so long as you did not go and trade shares of individual companies as well.

      "The last few years of the 21st century have brought about a dramatic transformation of American society. It's the most important transition most of us have seen in years, because these changes are more fundamental than most people understand. They are redefining the relationship between people at the top and the rest of us. And they are radically transforming both work and our economy too.\n\nIn my recent book, The Longer You Look at it, I described the shift as the Great Acceleration. It began in 1999 with the advent of the Internet, which was an important step forward. But a new invention took off a few months later, when Amazon.com debuted its online bookstore. Amazon made it easy for many more people to shop, and it made it possible for small local retailers to create and dominate online sales. Then, several years later, Google became the largest search engine out there, and Facebook came along as yet another popular social network. This allowed even more people to share and discover things with each other – more people looking at the same stuff, more people buying the same stuff.\n\nBut there was another way of looking at the shift, too. The growth in online searches during the internet era had been slow – it had been a trickle. But the Great Acceleration had not been going on for nearly 20 years. And it was fast. So fast in fact, that the last few years had generated only 2 percent growth in both the number of searches and the length of time people searched.\n\nWhat changed? Why were we so slow to adopt these new technologies? Why had so many people and businesses been waiting so long for them to come out on the market and gain serious market traction?\n\nOne explanation is that it wasn't until Google that we were fully aware of the Great Acceleration. Our cultural values and habits had been set in place, and when Google got its start, so many of us thought it was something that Google was simply doing, a normal part of the business as it had been for so many years.\n\nAnd it sure hadn't seemed strange. Before Google, there was a great number of companies that sold search engines, from BlueKai to AltaVista to Baidu to Intuit Inc. (they all changed their names several times during these years). Google's founders had already had success in the computer search business before they ever started their company. In its earliest days, they made a lot of money selling direct-response ads. If you had an ad that said \"Buy this item\" and someone looked up the item on the Internet and bought it, you'd get money from the advertiser who had spent the most money looking up a specific item. This meant that the advertiser would get a profit that you could spend on your product. A lot of companies tried to do something like this. Amazon.com tried it to the extent of buying Yahoo's search business in 2005.\n\nBut Google didn't want to do Amazon's business. Google wanted to go beyond ads, and it did.\n\nWhy do we know that Google wasn't doing this as a normal part of the internet business? How could we possibly have missed all this before? After all, this was an organization that had already gotten a lot of traction in the web search business by starting with the product that most people already used on the web – their web browser. They were already building one that would make it easy to put information on the web. How could there be something even more interesting that would take this idea to the next level and do something that would shake up our entire way of doing business?\n\nThe answer is that we didn't miss it. We didn't even think about it. We just assumed it had always been there – just that we hadn't ever noticed it before.\n\nSo why didn't we notice it? Because the Great Acceleration hadn't been going on for nearly 20 years – and even if it had, we were still a part of it.\n\nThis is where new businesses and new services and new technologies usually stop taking off. It's about time to stop thinking about the Great Acceleration and start thinking about what's coming next.\n\nIt's important to realize that the Great Acceleration is not a single thing – it can't be. It's not the Internet, it's not Amazon, it's not anyone or anything other than us. No single company or person is responsible for this transformation.\n\nIt can't be reduced to the changes of the last few decades – the dramatic improvement in the quality of American education, for example. All of the trends, such as rising incomes and declining poverty, have happened at similar rates before. But as people get better at achieving what they want (or have to do to make ends meet) they are then less willing to spend as an average of 12 percent of their income on necessities (food, housing, health care, etc.) – and they're willing to spend the rest buying things that are only relatively cheap in the digital era",
      "A little-reported statistic is that Americans are among the most anxious people in the world.\n\nAs Gallup reported over the weekend, anxiety has been in the news more than a few times over the past year. Americans are more anxious than ever — in 2013, Gallup reported Americans were the most anxious in the world by a wide margin.\n\nAccording to Gallup, Americans' \"overall well-being, which includes overall life satisfaction, job satisfaction, physical health and well-being, fell by 1.3 percentage points to 65.2 percent\" in 2013.\n\nWhile Americans' anxiety levels have improved over the past few years (when they went from being the most anxious people in the world in 2009), they are still at their highest levels ever recorded.\n\nThe only major uptick in Americans' state of anxiety from 2009 is that of depression. Gallup reports that \"upward fluctuations in the prevalence rates of depression in recent years may be linked to improved access to antidepressant medication such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram.\"\n\n\"Other factors have contributed to the increased rates of anxiety,\" Gallup reports. When people feel depressed, they are more depressed and they take more antidepressants. And when people are anxious, they have more anxious thoughts, which in turn make them anxious.\n\nThe good news is that some studies are suggesting that we can lessen our anxiety and depression.\n\nOne study was published in 2014 in The Journal of Psychotherapy and Psychosomatic Nursing. Researchers studied the effects of a mindfulness-based technique known as Acceptance & Commitment Therapy or ACT on the prevalence of anxiety disorder, depression, and low mood in adults. They concluded that ACT's approach significantly reduced depression rates while significantly promoting improvements in emotional well-being.\n\nAnother study released in 2013 in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that a brief course of mindfulness meditation reduced levels of depressive feelings in clinical anxiety disorder patients, while increasing levels of positive emotions. \"Meditation's effects may be mediated by alterations in brain connectivity,\" the researchers wrote. \"Moreover, meditation may promote recovery from anxiety and depression.\"\n\nMeditation may also protect against chronic diseases. A small study led by University of California, Los Angeles professor Steven S. Jones found a possible connection between a \"mindfulness meditation\" practice and protection against heart attack, stroke, dementia, and some types of cancer.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health reported in 2014 that a small study of meditators and non-meditators found that mindfulness improved the ability of meditators to control their breathing. For non-meditators, it helped them control their breathing faster and slower; and as a result their ability to monitor their physical reactions to stress dropped.\n\nThe authors said their study \"suggests that meditation might promote cognitive control over the autonomic nervous system in ways that protect against many chronic diseases.\"\n\nAnd that is all to say nothing of the recent findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences indicating that meditation may \"reduce anxiety symptoms, especially in patients with depression.\" And the growing body of literature suggesting meditation may actually lead to greater happiness. The science is all pointing in that direction.\n\nA recent paper published in Psychological Science suggests that meditation decreases the perceived negative content of our thoughts, which makes us happier and calmer.\n\nAs researchers explained in the paper, meditation \"reduces the perceived negative content of a person's thoughts by enhancing activity in certain areas of the brain that are associated with positive affect and mental well-being.\"\n\n\"What this means is that if an anxious or neurotic person meditates, what is perceived as the negative content in the subject's thoughts is reduced, and by association, the content of the thoughts themselves, such as their negative affect, is decreased,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe idea is that over time, meditation can reduce the content of negative thoughts and make people feel more pleasant.\n\nIn their paper, the researchers asked the participants to perform three types of mental tasks while they focused on either their emotional reaction to negative thoughts or their cognitive response to other negative thoughts. During the first round of tests, the study subjects were asked to imagine the negative thoughts in their minds. When they were asked to perform the second round of the test, they were told to focus on the cognitive response to the thoughts.\n\nThe researchers found that participants who first imagined the negative thoughts reported being happier the entire time and had a lower desire to do the third round of the test. The authors concluded that participants who engaged in mental imagery had a greater state of positive affect and \"experienced reduced negativity at the cognitive level.\"\n\nSome of the most powerful evidence for the idea that meditation can reduce anxiety and depression isn't just coming from scientific studies alone — much like the mindfulness meditation research being conducted by UC L in 2014, some of the most effective forms of meditation in everyday life are actually pretty easy to learn and practice.\n\nAccording to an article published in",
      "In the past 18 months I have lost several 100-pound women. I have lost hundreds of pounds, but I've always had one thing in mind: to get back to my pre-baby weight.\n\nWhen I lost so much weight I became concerned that I would eventually be overweight, just like I was at 23. I'm an emotional person, and I felt like I still had a lot of things to unlearn about my body that I had learned during my pregnancy. However, I quickly saw that a lot of the things I had learned about my body during my pregnancy were not really relevant to new motherhood (like not putting on enough weight or not being good at maintaining a high level of fitness when you're pregnant). I was so grateful to be in the best shape possible during pregnancy, but it wasn't as important to start off my new life as I had once thought.\n\nWhen my doctor suggested we try to lose body fat so that I would be at a healthy weight when my baby arrived, I thought he was nuts. I felt incredibly nervous and even somewhat ashamed about having gone through with having a baby before I gained a significant amount of weight.\n\nI know some women will say, \"Well, I didn't start a new life and all that matters to me is me being healthy when I have a child,\" but that isn't really how I think. I've always cared deeply about my physical well-being. At 23 I was overweight but it didn't make me unhappy. I knew in my heart that I was healthier than other women I knew, but I thought it was still important to feel good. And at 35 I was already feeling good, thanks to my daily cardio routine and eating habits. Now I'm healthy and don't feel any of the sadness I felt about losing my baby weight.\n\nThere are a few strategies I use to stay motivated and motivated in my new baby weight goal.\n\nRead my blog post, What Is Your Favorite Strategy to Stay Motivated?\n\nStart with simple things\n\nI like to think that we have a few simple things in common, like a preference for running over the track, or a love of yoga…or, of course, our preferences in food. I start by asking myself \"What would happen if I was to go to that restaurant and order that drink?\" If it turns out I have already gone there a bunch of times and always felt comfortable eating there and ordering that drink, then I know that I can try to go to that restaurant a bit more often instead of avoiding it for fear of giving myself anxiety.\n\nI also like to start with small changes. For example, if I notice that I'm eating more often, I can start walking as I do so.\n\nTry new things\n\nWhenever I have a new baby, I think about the benefits of trying new things on a regular basis. The most basic benefit is that there is usually time to do some relaxation techniques and practice mindfulness techniques like breathing.\n\nTry doing one thing as much as you can. For example, instead of eating the same food every single day, start cooking the same way every single day. Or instead of exercising the way you usually exercise, start walking a few minutes each day or doing a new exercise.\n\nTake control of your life\n\nIf you are in a relationship and are in the gym, then be in the gym. If you are in an office and don't like working out then be in an office. Don't feel like you have to do the same thing day in and day out. You can do more or less. It's your life. Do you love to do cardio? Start exercising. If you hate cardio, maybe start a new activity such as yoga.\n\nI also think that changing your attitude about your life is often the most important thing. I used to hate going to the gym (it seemed too hard to me) but recently I started lifting weights and started doing some cardio. I am amazed at how much my mood changes to more positive, even though I still do it quite a few times a week and have lost a few pounds.\n\nI don't think we actually think about changing our attitude so often…even when we want to. When we start exercising, we begin to enjoy it and get more used to it. It becomes less daunting and we get excited and feel like we can do it every day. Once we start doing it, we feel more satisfied, not just about doing it, but about what we do. We don't even need to be motivated anymore. We just decide to start exercising, and life gets better.\n\nWhen is it time to end the weight loss effort and get back to pre-pregnancy weight?\n\nFor a few months postpartum, you should continue to see small steps into your postpartum weight loss, but gradually you'll begin to notice your weight begin to rebound. I generally think about that rebound as about six months postpartum until you are",

This is an exciting and difficult time because we're playing three weeks in a row now and then playing three weeks in three months, so it's like, are we going to be focused in our training?

The ACLU is responsible for the program, according to the New York Times.\n\nNew York City and the New York Police Department have a long history of anti-bias and tolerance.

Caption Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party's convention in Cleveland. Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at Trump Doral golf course in Miami. Carlo Allegri/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nThe day after his speech in Cleveland, Donald Trump addressed a largely hostile crowd of thousands to rouse them for his forthcoming speech — though not in person.\n\nIt's an unusual tactic, so unusual that some in attendance thought they were watching a video of Trump's speech in a mock-up.\n\nSo why are Republican leaders in Cleveland, with their traditional venue of a convention hall, not giving Trump his own convention hall? The answer lies in the rules of the GOP convention, established in 2012, which bar a sitting president from presiding over or speaking at its proceedings.\n\n\"All presidential candidates must clear the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the presidential nomination at the convention,\" said Rob Stutzman (@RSstutzman) July 18, 2016\n\nThe problem, Stutzman points out, is that this means that Trump could lose the election and still win. That is, he can lose and still become president.\n\nOn May 8, 2016, the day of a Mayoral primary, Donald Trump won the New York primary and finished second in the Connecticut primary. At the time, his campaign was confident that he would ultimately win the Republican nomination.\n\nBy August, Trump had a chance to actually become president and, at the last minute, he reversed his position and said he was no longer withdrawing his candidacy but was instead just giving a speech on immigration. The New York primary fell on a Saturday in September, which was an acceptable day to lose.\n\nTrump said this, according to Stutzman: \"We're gonna make America great again. Believe me. We're going to make the United States of America great again.\"\n\nBut Stutzman believes that Trump didn't fully realize that he would lose on the day of the primary. So, he thinks he would have lost anyway.\n\n\"[Trump] should have told them what he intended to do when he was elected president,\" Stutzman said in a statement to Politifact. \"Instead he decided to give his supporters what they wanted and try to prevent [Hillary Clinton] from winning the White House.\"\n\nTrump's speech in Cleveland has no such rules.\n\nStutzman's statements are also not consistent with RNC rules, which state: \"A sitting president may not address the Republican National Convention, a convention of a national party or the Republican Party,\" according to a rule passed by the RNC in 2012.\n\nTrump, however, has always been an exception to this rule, which, like the other rules, is also inconsistent with the rules of presidential nomination itself. All presidential speeches before the Democratic and Republican conventions all have a limit.\n\nThe rule for the Democrats reads, \"a sitting president may not address the Democratic National Convention.\"\n\nFor the Republicans, a sitting president can address their party convention at the earliest date possible because of the new rules passed under President George W. Bush.\n\nThe rule that has traditionally applied only to vice president. It reads, \"No sitting vice president shall be allowed to address either convention.\"\n\nFor the Democrats, vice presidential candidates like Al Gore or John Edwards have been allowed to speak in prior years, but Trump himself has never been one of them, according to media reports. As noted above, both Bush and Romney were presidential candidates in their respective party elections, but did not do so. However, it is clear Trump is in the category of one such exception.\n\nIn fact, the only exception to the Republican Party rule has come from a recent history among some Democrats — for a time it was Barack Obama and Joe Biden who could speak on behalf of any Democratic convention. Obama ended up being the nominee that year and was actually sworn in on the day of the Democratic convention, while Biden didn't take the oath until two days later (June 14), but the Democratic Convention was still held.\n\nIt is still unclear how this will play out on the floor of the GOP convention in Cleveland at this time. It is possible Trump could actually lose that week and still receive the nomination, but it is possible Trump could simply win the remaining two states and be elected president, even in this scenario.\n\nHere's Stutzman's full statement to Politifact:",

He also suggested he wouldn't have taken part in the UFC 184 pay-per-view event if he was \"on the fence\".\n\n\n\"I'm not resting on my laurels, no,\" he said.\n\n\"I just need to continue to get better. I've done it for the last couple years but it's time to really put people to test for their ability.\n\n\"I always thought I could beat the best ever, like Anderson Silva, Jon Jones but it's about putting people in their place to show that my ability can be matched, and I look forward to seeing what happens.\n\n\"I have a full training camp under me, and I'm looking forward to continuing to grow as a fighter.\"\n\nJones' fight with Cormier took place at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

      "By Dan Merica (CNN)\n\nHere's what you need to know about the new CNN Poll of Polls:\n\nThe polls are based on landline and cell phones, interviewed online and by cell phone, with a total sample of 942 likely voters. The polls are conducted online and by cell phone, and both methods have a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points for overall results, plus or minus 4 percentage points for results among registered voters and registered voters. There is no minimum weight for the subsamples, and they are combined into a single estimate for overall results.\n\nRead the methodology here.\n\nThe poll comes as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has surged in the Republican race, while the front-runner Donald Trump is under renewed scrutiny for his handling of anti-Clinton issues.\n\nThe results:\n\nCruz is the first choice of 22% of likely GOP primary voters, followed by Trump, with 21%, followed by Ben Carson at 12%, Carly Fiorina at 10%, John Kasich, with 10%, Chris Christie, with 9%, Rand Paul, with 7%, Jeb Bush, with 6%, Mike Huckabee, with 5%, Jim Gilmore, with 5%, and Bobby Jindal, with 4%.\n\nAsked about Cruz and Trump, 30% of likely GOP primary voters said that they would look favorably on Cruz, while 43% would not like the two men.\n\nFifty-seven percent think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while 30% don't.\n\nAsked about the choice for president, 24% said Cruz, 22% said Trump, 14% said Carson, 12% said Fiorina, 10% said Paul, and 7% said Kasich.\n\nThirty-four percent said Clinton would be preferable to Cruz, 20% preferred Trump at the moment, and 13% would prefer Fiorina.\n\nClinton is widely seen as the \"strongest\" candidate on national security, with 61% of likely Republican voters saying so. She's seen as the candidate who would \"do the best job fighting terrorism,\" with 46%, but she's only in a tie for second place with Cruz at 11%.\n\nSixty-four percent said they were less concerned about terrorism as a result of Clinton being in the race. Meanwhile, 41% said they had less worried about terrorism as a result of Cruz being in the race.\n\nWhen it comes to ISIS and other national security threats to the U.S., Clinton leads the list, and by a large margin, with 57% saying they are \"very worried\" about the ISIS threat compared to just 30% for Cruz and 22% for Trump.\n\nWhen Clinton and Sanders trade spots, Sanders was seen to be the one best positioned to defeat Islamic State, although that's more of a theoretical outcome than an actual possibility for the primary to hold the nomination. Forty-four percent said Sanders would do better in this fight, and 37% said Clinton, but the numbers show Sanders' weakness on this point. He had the support of only 25% of likely caucusgoers.\n\nOn the questions of honesty and trustworthiness, Cruz was seen to have the best overall brand, with 48% having a favorable view of him, followed closely by Trump (44%), and Carson with 43%.\n\nThis poll was conducted using interactive voice response with live interviewers, including 453 registered voters who said they're Republican or independents leaning toward the Republican Party.\n\nAll media outlets are welcome to reproduce, reproduce, modify, publish, publicly display, broadcast and distribute such material.

      "TALLAHASSEE — Florida's highest-paid state workers are now getting a raise for the first time since 2011, when President Bill Clinton signed a law that capped their pay at $120,000 a year.\n\nThis year, top state workers will get an additional 3 percent salary boost — a bump from the current 2.25 percent. That's good news for those who helped raise taxes for the 2014-2015 fiscal year by an average of 7.5 percent, and for those who work in the state government.\n\nThe increases will take place over the 2015 budget year, which begins July 1.\n\n\"It's great news for our taxpayers,\" Gov. Rick Scott said at a news conference earlier this month announcing the raise. \"There was quite a bit of work done during this last legislative session that helped us bring all the state employees' pay at the federal level in line with their Florida counterparts.\"\n\nThe raise is part of a larger budget surplus for this coming year, which is forecast by the Florida Department of Management Services to top a record $11 billion.\n\nFlorida's salary cap for state employees is $140,931. The highest-paid state workers are currently getting a 2.7 percent pay increase, with the 2 percent increase taking effect in July.\n\nThe state Legislature passed the salary cap bill in 2011, which capped the cap at $119,000 a year and eliminated the automatic annual increment that the Legislature would push up their pay based on increases in the nation's average salary.\n\nBut the law also called for annual increases for state workers by inflation that would not go back into effect until 2021.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats clashed during a two-day special session in June 2013, and many people saw the wage cap legislation as punitive toward state employees. It also made it more difficult to negotiate union contracts. The Legislature failed to override the veto of Republican Gov. Rick Scott and the cuts became law.\n\nThe 2013 law also created a 1 percent cap for all new state employees.\n\nA total of 33,000 state workers will get raises next year, with a slight increase in state employee pay compared to last year.\n\nAmong the state's top earners, the median state-employee wage of $107,560 is now 4.1 percent higher than its 2011-2012 mean. That is the second straight year that state pay has increased, and the median state-employee pay increased 2.7 percent, according to the most recent salary estimates from the Florida Department of Management Services.\n\nThe average pay of state workers will increase to just more than $115,000 this year, an increase of 2.7 percent since 2011.\n\nScott, who has championed state workers' pay with an emphasis on productivity, said pay increases have allowed state agencies to hire more people, save them money, create better wages for workers and improve service.\n\n\"Today's minimum wage worker brings a lot of value to our economy,\" Scott said.\n\nOn the plus side, state workers will also be paid 7 percent more this year for health insurance. For some employees, it's a lot: the median state-employee health insurance cost of $4,000 increased by 6.5 percent in state-employee pay over the last year.\n\nOther increases are expected next year to be spread more evenly across employees.\n\nTo view the complete salary bill, click here.",
      "The \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" movie opened over the holiday weekend and is still breaking attendance records as well as box office records. Many people are surprised by the positive reviews that the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" movie received, especially after its $160 million budget.\n\nThe book \"Fifty Shades ofGrey\" sold more than 10 million copies, and it continues to be a best-seller on Amazon. The movie itself has not been able to surpass its predecessor, which sold nearly 20 million copies.\n\nAlthough some people are disappointed in the movie, the book is still still flying off the shelves, but some have been looking for ways to earn money to be able to buy a copy of the movie.\n\nEntertainment Tonight's James Lipton went undercover at a bookstore in Toronto, Canada to try and buy a copy of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Lipton purchased a copy of the book for just $7.25 (about RM65) and was allowed to take a photo of the cover before he paid, which allowed the retailer to verify that it was the correct page.\n\nWhen his credit card was charged, Lipton took a picture of the receipt with the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" copyright.\n\nAccording to Canadian News, it cost the bookstore just RM6.50 for the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" book. Lipton was allowed to keep most of the money after his purchase and returned the book a few hours later.\n\nIt seems that the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" movie has a lot of fans outside of the United States, Canada and the UK.\n\nOn October 21, 2017, a man in the United States wrote up an entire blog about how he was allowed to buy \"The Fifty Shades of Grey\" movie. On his entry, the man wrote that he went to Barnes and Noble near him. Then he got up and did a bit of researching online and checked out the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" store near him in Seattle. The store actually posted an advertisement on their website, and all one had to do was buy a book at the store in Seattle and enter a code to buy on Amazon. After finding the correct title for the book, the man was allowed to take a photo of the cover and scan the barcode to verify that he had bought the book.\n\nHe did not tell any of his friends that he had bought a book from the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" movie. He also didn't tell anyone of the entire \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" story and how he was involved in it.\n\nHis blog post went viral and his actions were well-received by his readers, with many praising his ingenuity and kindness for not only buying the movie in the first place but also for allowing others to enjoy the book as well.\n\nOne of the best responses to his \"book steal\" was posted by one of his readers. The author wrote, when someone tries to sell you something without your consent and you are a fan of that object, what you do is, you go directly to the source.

      "Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren blasted the House Republicans for what she called \"totally unacceptable\" legislation targeting women's health, writing Monday in The Boston Globe that the legislation is \"the latest evidence that the GOP is hostile to the health and safety of women.\"\n\nThe GOP-sponsored legislation, which was announced July 14, would cut funding to Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides services to millions of people. The funding is essential for the organization to continue providing women with birth control and preventive care like cancer screenings and breast exams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nIn explaining her opposition to the legislation, Warren specifically called out Sens. Lamar Alexander, R., Ohio, and Patty Murray, D., Washington, for \"unfair and irresponsible cuts\" to Planned Parenthood, which have included funding for family planning exams.\n\n\"As members of Congress, we have the responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars don't pay for the abortions—including those in which a woman suffers from untreated cancer or serious fetal abnormalities—of nearly 3 million people a year,\" she wrote. \"Planned Parenthood's services are essential to women's health. Yet to pay for them, Republicans would cut off a women's health care provider, defund Planned Parenthood and replace the money with tax breaks for millionaires and big businesses.\"\n\nThough Warren acknowledged that \"Planned Parenthood has been the largest provider of low-cost family planning services\" for \"more than 60 years,\" she continued, it's unclear how the new funding cuts would allow for more family planning services. But Warren is no stranger to criticizing Republicans for cutting funding to women's health programs. She also wrote about their policies in her book on the 2016 presidential race, Our Country Deserves a Better Deal.\n\nIn addition to the cut in funding to Planned Parenthood, the new GOP health care legislation also includes a provision to let hospitals use an annual cap of 11.5 percent of total hospital funds to provide family-planning services, a reduction from 18.5 percent currently. The bill also eliminates Obamacare protections that keep insurance plans that cover abortion from discriminating in certain circumstances, a move that could allow states to allow insurers to ban insurance plans that cover abortion coverage.",
      "We hope.\n\nOn Wednesday the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved the draft of a proposed $7 billion cut in military funding in the annual defense appropriations bill, a cut that's sure to draw fire from Pentagon brass. That's despite the fact that the new draft is unlikely to ever be voted on by the full chamber — which is where a big piece of the proposed cut came from.\n\nDuring committee markup Wednesday, Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) called for two major cuts: $4.7 billion from the Army — the biggest cut the draft calls for — and $2 billion from the Navy.\n\n\"These are significant cuts that affect our readiness and our capabilities,\" Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale told the House Armed Services Committee on Monday. \"The committee should send this proposal to the desk of the commander in chief immediately.\"\n\nAs for the budget bill itself, the bill would raise the caps on defense spending as mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act to $525 billion in the next fiscal year and to $516 billion in fiscal 2018, and then to $518 billion in fiscal 2019. But, if all goes as planned, the bill would also reduce spending on overseas contingency operations — a.k.a, the war budget — to $50 billion in fiscal 2016 and $49 billion in 2017, compared to $70 billion in fiscal 2014, according to the committee's draft.\n\n\"The draft bill does not appear to address the serious national security challenges facing the United States,\" Rep. Jim Moran (D-VA), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement after the markup when the committee finished. \"Unless changes are made to the bill, the budget compromise will undermine the nation's ability to deter and defend against major conflicts around the globe on the verge, and potentially for the long term.\"\n\nDuring a press conference with House Armed Services leaders after the markup on Tuesday, Pentagon Sec. Ashton Carter declined to comment on the House's concerns about a Pentagon budget that is on track to consume a larger share of the federal deficit than any other in history.\n\n\"Let me give you my best estimate today. The Department of Defense's plan to meet funding caps set out by the Budget Control Act does not threaten our strategic priorities. … We are confident that we have adequate funding to meet our missions,\" Carter said at the press conference.\n\nRep. Walter Jones (R-NC), who also helped draft the Pentagon's 2013 Defense Management Directive (DMD) that called for the first ever caps, also refused to put much stock in the House defense budget, saying that the new draft is only a first step toward a bigger budget debate in the months ahead. \"This is a first step,\" Jones said.\n\nBut it doesn't look like much of a step. The House Armed Services Committee held a hearing on Wednesday on how to make the federal budget work efficiently. And after the hearing, Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ), who chairs the Air Force Subcommittee that handles the Air Force budget, said she doesn't believe the Army is under an enormous threat. \"I don't see them becoming more vulnerable. I see them being more modernized and more relevant, and being more relevant to a future threat environment,\" McMasally said.\n\nThe White House has previously urged Congress to make some kind of deal on the Pentagon spending cap as the country faces an ongoing defense spending deficit. And just last Thursday the White House signed on to a letter sent to Congress by four former Republican defense secretaries calling on members to \"re-center funding and priorities in the Defense Department and in the broader U.S. national security strategy.\" (The letter did not, however, specifically mention cuts to the Air Force or the Navy in its recommendations.)\n\n\"As the president and his Secretary of Defense lay the groundwork for comprehensive deficit reduction, Congress should re-centER funding and priorities in the defense Department and in the broader U.S. national security strategy,\" former secretaries Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Donald H. Rumsfeld wrote in the letter.\n\nIf no deal is reached, and if the Pentagon budget gets as deep into the red as the White House has called for, Congress will need to either revisit the cap, which was created during the height of the George W. Bush administration, or find another way to reduce the budget.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia",

      "Rape or sexual abuse in the military is all too common for female soldiers. The military must take immediate action to eliminate the growing problem, according to the Pentagon's inspector general.\n\n\"Rape and sexual assault of female service members is unacceptable and must be stopped,\" Inspector General Michael E. Missal wrote Wednesday in a letter to Defense Secretary Ash Carter saying the Defense Department had not done enough to address the problem.\n\nAccording to Mr. Missal, a report released last year by the military's Inspector General found that the number of substantiated allegations of rape or sexual assault by military members reached nearly 1,200 in the fiscal year through September 2014, an increase of nearly 30 percent since fiscal 2011.\n\nAbout one in four active duty female service members was raped or sexually assaulted, according to the findings.\n\nThe Defense Department has been plagued by reports of sexual misconduct by male and female service members.\n\nIn December, a report by the Pentagon's Inspector General found that there had been at least 15 sexual abuse cases involving active-duty military in the past five years that have gone unreported because they did not involve a servicemember accused of rape or sexual assault. In many of those cases, investigators were unable to identify a victim or the perpetrator.\n\nMost recently, in May, a Pentagon report revealed that three female military members in recent years had been raped. As The Washington Times reported earlier this year, an additional eight reported cases since 2012 have also been classified as rape or sexual assault.\n\n\"We will continue to hold military leaders accountable to ensuring the safety of our women and soldiers,\" Ms. Carter said in a statement released Thursday. \"Sexual assault in the military remains a serious problem. This report confirms the severity and breadth of it and reinforces our commitment to eliminating it as a threat to our national security.\"\n\nIn response to the reports of rapes and sexual assaults, more than 50 sexual assault prevention and response teams across the military have been deployed during the last few months.\n\nAs of Wednesday, there were 1,065 cases of sexual assault or rape involving active duty forces. Of those, more than one in four reports involved a person accused of rape or sexual assault and nearly half involved an incident involving force, the Pentagon said in a summary of the report.\n\n\nCopyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

      "On this page:\n\nDescription\n\nThere are many types of listeria for which there is no commercial vaccine in the U.S. Although the disease is treatable, many people have had to undergo hospitalization due to the illness. As of 2018, the FDA has approved a vaccine to prevent listeria illness. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism that can survive and cause disease in the form of listeriosis, a rare condition in which symptoms may not appear until after several weeks have passed from the initial infection. It is thought that most people are infected by consuming the food or beverages of someone who has listeria. Listeria has been identified in dairy products, food, water, pet food, poultry, fish, eggs, and wild game. Listeriosis can result in serious illnesses, such as meningitis, or can cause long-term, life-threatening problems if not diagnosed and treated early. One of the major threats to the public health is that while listeria can be treated, antibiotic drugs don't always work and many people with listeria infection still suffer from the infection.\n\nListeriosis symptoms\n\nListeria may initially cause a \"bad feeling\" in the stomach, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and sometimes fever. This is known as \"first-degree\" listeriosis. The symptoms worsen and a person's weight or overall health may deteriorate, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The severity of the illness depends on the type of listeria.\n\nA person who has just been exposed to Listeria may feel no ill effects at first. However after several days, the body forms antibodies in response to the bacteria, making the person more likely to develop a high fever, chills, and abdominal pain. People who have Listeria monocytogenes infection are at increased risk of developing life-threatening problems from the infection if they do not receive prompt care for themselves or become ill in a high-risk group of people.\n\nIn the meantime\n\nListeria causes life-threatening infections and other medical problems that can take a long time to develop, even after the infection has been diagnosed. If Listeria is acquired from food or water, prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent the need for hospitalization or unnecessary additional hospitalizations.\n\nMany health care organizations offer free or low-cost testing for listeriosis. The Minnesota Department of Health offers free testing in the United States, Canada, and most European countries. The University of Minnesota Immunization Service offers a free listeriosis test in Minnesota and a test that tests for listeria in Wisconsin. Contact your county health department for a referral.\n\nListeriosis can be treated with antibiotics. People who have Listeria monocytogenes infection do not need to take medicine, but others need to be cautious while not sick.\n\nPre-existing diseases can cause the illness, especially if people have previous gastrointestinal (GI) problems. People should keep their intestines and throats healthy to prevent other potentially serious intestinal infections. Most cases of listeriosis in the US are caused by Listeria monocytogenes infection, but other types of bacteria have been implicated. If someone has had diarrhea recently they should see a doctor, and if they have a recent cold they should take it very seriously.\n\nPrevention\n\nThe FDA has used the Listeria monocytogenes vaccine to prevent serious outbreaks of listeriosis. While there is no approved vaccine for the prevention of listeriosis in the U.S. there are safe and effective vaccines to prevent other bacteria, including E. coli and Salmonella. Some preventive measures are taken during food preparation, such as ensuring that food and drinks are prepared properly.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all people between the ages of 1 and 64 years do not eat or drink raw eggs or foods made from whole-grain, whole-wheat, or pasta.\n\nPreventing illnesses from food and water also is important.\n\nIt is important to be aware of other risk factors for listeriosis, such as obesity and immunosupression, among groups of people who may be more likely to develop a listeriosis infection.

      "By: Matt Gagnon, Ph.D., DVM\n\nIt is generally believed that a cat can live for anywhere from five to 10 years, and some people even go as far as to think that cats can live for over 30 years. Cats have no need for food but rather for water and food. Cats will eat almost anything you put in front of them and when they refuse you food for a few days due to a bad smell, it's usually caused by the cats lack of appetite.\n\nAs long as a cat has access to clean water, food, and shelter, they will live well without food. When food is provided to a cat they are more likely to eat it, if it is not, they will eventually starve. They will eat anything they can fit in their mouths but they will also eat whatever they can find in the house and on the ground as well.\n\nA cat's diet when young and in its first few years is often comprised entirely of pureed vegetables and fruits. This is a cat's natural food and it won't be long before it is able to eat any meat by adding a little protein or fat along with it along with their vegetables. They will also eat all types of vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, watermelon, potatoes, and green beans. All three of the most commonly seen vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, and watermelon, will cause them to excrete an odor and should be avoided. Fresh vegetables are a better choice as the cat will tend to have more overall appetite and thus more of their food is absorbed into them. This also applies to any type of meat.\n\nOnce a cat has matured into one with a more natural diet, you should change some of the things you give it. Most young cats should be fed a cat food that has a lot of protein, fat, and fiber. This is usually in the 30% to 36% range. As they get older they will begin to be more able to digest meat and a more refined diet will be offered that contains lots of vegetable matter in addition to a higher amount of protein.\n\nA young cat should only be fed in two ways, a dry dry or moist, or a moist. For a young kitten, it's best to give them a dry dry food. Wet food is better if he is older and will want to eat the wet food instead of the dry. Give your cat a small, one pound, dry amount every other day until they are about six months of age. If your cat is a mature adult, feed them a wet wet dry every single day at this stage of your cat's life.\n\nThe following is a list of common problems that cats can present due to overfeeding:\n\nDiarrhea: This is usually the biggest problem with overfeeding. The cat will begin to purge the food into its body and will need to eliminate its bodily wastes.\n\nThis is usually the biggest problem with overfeeding. The cat will begin to purge the food into its body and will need to eliminate its bodily wastes. Liver Failure: A cat's liver plays a major role in the digestion of its food. If the cat is starving, and the cat has over-fed, it will probably start to lose their liver as a result. Also, if the cat has kidney problems, this could make the kidneys work much harder as they produce less toxins.\n\nA cat's liver plays a major role in the digestion of its food.

      "In our continuing efforts to educate our readers on the latest in global and national political developments and happenings, The BRAD BLOG will be providing you on a \"listening tour\" of key international and political events. We hope to bring you the latest details on the latest geopolitical news – from a global perspective. We invite you to take a look at our \"listening tour\" at the bottom of the page.\n\nOur \"listening tour\" will take us on in the following six international hotspots this summer:\n\n* The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, with an eye to the possible implications for the Middle East peace process\n\n* India and Pakistan to discuss expanding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to include civilian nuclear power\n\n* The growing tensions between Qatar and its neighbors, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain – plus its implications for the U.S.'s regional foreign affairs architecture and relations with its Gulf allies\n\n* A major political crisis, as in Greece and its potential implications for the debt negotiations, Greece's Eurozone membership and its impact on the European Union itself, and Italy's referendum in regards to EU membership and what to do next\n\n* The upcoming Greek parliamentary elections – which would potentially determine whether the country stays in the Eurozone or goes its own way\n\n* The growing influence of Russia in the Middle East and in the EU's Eastern neighbors\n\n* The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the wake of Operation Pillar of Defense in Gaza in the most recent Israeli military offensive, which began on April 10\n\n* The EU's own financial woes, from the ongoing Greek crisis, to the ongoing debate over Greece and Greece's possible exit from Greece after a failure to reach a deal on a new bailout.\n\nOur \"listening tour\" will begin in Greece, and our specific topics of attention will begin to shift from Greece to other EU countries and European region's as it relates to Greece, before ending with Egypt, and a possible move towards a \"Greater Israel.\"\n\n\"The list of events is growing as there are some major developments in the European Union. A great conflict looms on the horizon and Greece is looking uncertain as the political factions battle over which way Greece will go.\" – Global Research.\n\n* * *\n\nThe current Greek crisis started in 2010 when then-prime minister George Papandreou decided – against the advice of international financial markets and with no official parliamentary mandate – to reject the terms of his country's bailout agreement with the European Commission. The terms include austerity measures for Greece and are designed to bring Greece into line with EU regulations.\n\nGreece's Euro Zone membership meant that the country was technically independent and it was not obliged to abide by EU laws. That independence has led to an increasing divergence of interests between Brussels and Athens, as well as disagreements over the role of the European Union in addressing Greece's economic woes.\n\nThe growing tension between Qatar and its neighbors, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, plus its implications for the U.S.'s regional foreign affairs architecture and relations with its Gulf allies (which has seen it threaten to sever diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab Gulf states) has caught the attention of The BRAD BLOG. The regional power struggle is rooted in Qatari claims to all of the Arabian Gulf, which includes a border dispute with Bahrain – which has taken a hard-line stance toward Qatar.\n\nOn May 1, the Qatari Foreign Ministry warned the GCC states of the consequences of not following its line.\n\nThe ongoing Greek crisis that recently exploded into violence has also taken on a geopolitical aspect in its impact on Greece and the Eurozone, with the potential of bringing a partial-exit of Greece from the Eurozone into focus.\n\nSince the beginning of the Greece's financial crisis, the financial aid program has been on a downward spiral since 2011. This trend has been supported by the Greek parliament's reluctance to support the bailout measures proposed by the ECB and International Monetary Fund.\n\nAt the beginning of May, as the Greek parliament was discussing a new budget and a request for a three month extension of its bailout with the European Union and the IMF, the Greek government received a letter from the governor of the Bank of Greece, Yannis Stournaras, indicating that his resignation was imminent. This would be a significant political blow to the new Greek government as it would be unable to seek another bailout.\n\nThe Greek government responded in a letter to the European Commission outlining its concerns about the terms of the loan requested by the European Union. The proposed debt repayment obligations alone would amount to about 20 percent of Greek GDP – a significant burden for a country that has already been suffering from two consecutive quarters of contraction and would likely further drive the country into a severe economic crisis.\n\nThe letter pointed out the Greek economy suffered from excessive debt at a time of its sovereign debt crisis, with excessive debt having been incurred without sufficient justification.\n\n",

      "How will our world change – if at all – as a result of the U.N.'s climate change summit? That's what the U.S. Institute for Policy Studies and a group of environmental and public health experts are asking you, with one simple question: \"What will the impact be if and when the U.N. Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meets its goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, to achieve 'the 2nd World Energy Revolution,'\" at least by 2100?\n\nThese \"experts\" have spent the last several years studying what exactly will happen if the U.N. Conference of Parties (COP21) meets its goal of reaching such a goal, and they are preparing to submit a report on those predictions to the Obama administration in the first week of the meeting.\n\nAccording to the American Institute for Public Affairs, the research team of seven included former senior U.S. negotiators at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, former senior U.S. officials at the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, and the International Monetary Fund's former deputy managing director Peter Rue, among others. That research will be published as a report in the first week of September 2016.\n\nThe Obama administration has called the international climate negotiations \"historic\" for their attempts to create international agreements to address climate change. But the question remains: Will those efforts succeed in preventing further degradation of our planet's climate? Will the changes that will result from a meeting between 195 countries – including the United States – achieve their goals, and is it possible that their progress and success, as a whole, will be \"unreal\"?\n\nFor the first time in U.S. history, it is possible that \"climate change impacts have reached a critical level – and our climate is changing,\" according to former Vice President Al Gore. \"We are at that tipping point – at the top of a mountain in Antarctica, the snow starts to drift to the sea. It turns into storm surge. Then, the mountain is washed away, and the ocean surges over it – over the island of Tarawa in the Pacific. Or we are right there, in the Pacific – the tsunami has hit.\"\n\nThe experts say that if we do a good job implementing laws that protect people against being \"dragged from their homes,\" our world will not be significantly changed by COP21. The biggest changes will, indeed, come from the implementation of policies on a global level – not at a national level. But, the report notes, the policies implemented by individual states and even states themselves may influence the trajectory of a change in global temperatures and temperatures could make our world significantly less livable in the short term.\n\nTo read the entire report, click here.",
      "T-Mobile announced last week that it would be testing a new network in select markets — and now it's ready to make that network official. The Un-carrier just launched its first network test in Atlanta. The trial is being run by T-Mobile and BRC Telecom, a subsidiary of BRC Corporation, for the purpose of studying the \"network impact\" of implementing LTE, as well as to provide better service to metro Atlanta's urban cores.\n\nT-Mobile says it will run a small number of customers on the network over the next few months, and then ramp up with more, all with the goal of turning Atlanta into the third \"LTE network certified city\" in the world. That's no small feat, as the US only has one or two cities with active LTE operations.\n\nAtlanta is just the start, though. T-Mobile is looking in addition to Atlanta for new tests in the South and Midwest.\n\nAt this point, we aren't sure exactly how many customers are going to have access to the network this early, either within the local markets or to those outside the city boundaries. In Atlanta, there are only a few places where the company said it planned to operate tests, including Brookwood and Reynoldstown, both of which are just a few blocks of metro Atlanta. T-Mobile says it plans to expand further into a few other locations (though it did not provide specifics).\n\nIt's unclear if T-Mobile will open up the network for more use after a test period, or if T-Mobile already has plans in place to expand when it's operating without a clear launch plan.\n\nAtlanta isn't the only new test market for the Un-carrier. T-Mobile opened a regional network testing office last week in Knoxville, Tennessee, and this week announced plans to launch LTE network tests throughout New York City (more on those shortly), Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix. This week saw new coverage launches in Austin, Houston, and San Antonio, as well.\n\nT-Mobile has been moving quickly across multiple US cities — particularly in the last couple of months — to gain a foothold and expand to the remaining ones. It first started rolling out LTE in the western part of the US in late 2015, and has since opened up nationwide service.\n\nThe company's efforts to reach new customers — particularly those outside areas where it already has a footprint, like cities and rural areas — have resulted in T-Mobile recently reaching a series of milestones. It's also begun to expand internationally, with the announcement this week of new international markets, and it's getting serious about launching international SIM cards in a bid to penetrate emerging markets where it's already available — like India.\n\nT-Mobile has also been making good on its promise to bring down prices and improve its network as it moves forward. It announced last week that it has reached 800 million customers outside the US, and its last two quarters of financial results have been impressive.\n\nT-Mobile's move to launch further testing in metro Atlanta is the latest proof of this, although it's not yet clear how long it will run. We've reached out to T-Mobile for more information and we'll update this post.",
      "It took quite a while to get all the documentation out of the CORE. For now the documentation is provided in the git repo here.\n\nCORE is a general-purpose, high-level, open-source framework for implementing real-time software-defined radios (RADs) using the Rust language and standard library. CORE is intended to be a first class citizen of modern day embedded systems development.\n\nWhat makes CORE different\n\nCORE aims to provide:\n\nhigh performance, flexible, high-level programming interfaces\n\nthe lowest common denominator in both language and library APIs\n\na complete implementation of RFC 827\n\nsupport for all the standards and specifications for software defined radios (SDR, RF), including FSK, SITORI, and P25\n\nRust as a first-class citizen of embedded systems\n\nas a first-class citizen of embedded systems easy to use C code with Rust, providing a common C-like experience, as well as a set of high-level methods for interfacing with any radio\n\nCORE is written using one single, unified, C language and library. Rust acts as the compiler on top of this C, and it's easy to write the desired Rust code, and even compile it at runtime.\n\nThe language and library APIs are unified across the whole framework, which allows for the following benefits:\n\nthe code is very idiomatic: there is no need for any type annotations\n\nit's well-typed and self-documenting, making it easy to get right\n\nit's well-tested by the community\n\nThe Rust compiler is able to compile CORE programs on the vast majority of real hardware. The C core of CORE relies on a few different libraries:\n\nRDF (pronounced rust-dude) is the standard library, providing definitions and functions for common protocols such as RDFa, SAML, and JSON.\n\nRTFM (pronounced rust-do-m) is the standard library for generating radio transmissions, and implements an SDR (Radio Data Language). Rust plays well together with RTFM so we decided to merge them together so the rest of this document uses the terms RTFM and SDR interchangeably.\n\nThe official CORE documentation is the authoritative reference source for what CORE does. It is hosted by https://wiki.coresrf.org and is maintained over a variety of different wiki environments.\n\nThere is documentation available for CORE for the following platforms:\n\nArduino Due, B+, Nano, Nano+\n\nCORE-M, MEGA, Mega+\n\nRaspberry Pi\n\nRaspberry Pi 2\n\nTeensy++ 2.0 (the Raspberry Pi core supports Teensy++ 1.0, but currently Teensy 1.0 only, but the documentation is still the main reference for Teensy++)\n\nRaspbery Pi Zero W\n\nRaspberry Pi Model B\n\nRaspberry Pi 3\n\nTeensy 3.0+\n\nRaspberry Pi B+, A+\n\nRaspberry Pi Zero W\n\nARMv8 devices\n\nA full overview of the supported hardware can be found on the ARMv8 section.\n\nA quick walkthrough of the CORE C runtime can be found here.\n\nArchitecture\n\nCORE consists of a high-level API and low-level binding to the software defined radio (SDR) hardware. The high level API calls are composed of generic methods that accept SDR data (with optional metadata), decode that data, and build a SDR packet, respectively.\n\nThe low level binding (CORE.h) is a single C header file, called Core.h , with definitions for various low-level functions. There is a separate file, Interface.h , that defines the interfaces to the CORE.h . The low-level API calls call CORE::CORE::SDR::c_init , in CORE.h , which initializes the CORE::CORE::SDR::c_init instance.\n\nSDR library\n\nThe SDR library defines a high-level API to interface with the most common SDR radio hardware, and provides a C API for interfacing with any device making use of SDR. This is the code that CORE.h depends on to be compiled. The SDR library also defines three low-level classes:\n\nSDR::SDR::RadioDevice, instantiates radio device instances based on the specified model and data.\n\nSDR::SDR::RadioStream, exposes an object containing radio data that can be read from a stream.\n\nSDR::SDR::RadioIntervalT, defines how often in seconds SDR streams will update their data.\n\nSDR libraries also provide a C API to interface with SDR-compatible radio hardware that",

If a lot of people are into what you're about, it's an indicator you could be doing something right.\n\nHow do you get better at talking to other people?\n\nYou don't want to go on the internet to read about how to be more popular or to learn all this shit that makes you a better looking person.\n\nDon't do that.\n\nGo find your local bars, go to a show, get a couple of friends to join you. Get in contact with other women. Find out how to get to know your peers as they talk to you. Do it at parties, in groups of friends, during dates, and make it a habit instead of a set of exercises to try out after having a really shitty night after a few drinks (it's so different at parties compared to a casual date).\n\nYou aren't the only hot, attractive woman in the world. Don't try and do something that would only work for a select few. Go hang out with other girls. Learn how to make conversation.\n\nHow do you get better at knowing how to fuck?\n\nWhat's more valuable than just knowing how to fuck?\n\nSo many guys that get into BDSM don't do anything with it that's actually BDSM. They do it because they want to feel like they're in control, like they control things.\n\nI'll say it again. The only purpose to be playing with stuff like rope is, first, to know how to do it. Second, for people who already know how to fuck themselves.\n\nI don't know about you, dear, but I can tell that a lot of guys take on learning things that are really, really not what they are looking for. I see this all the time; it's really sad. I get on Tinder and see that pretty face and I tell myself that she's going to be my dream girl and that I need to get to know her a bit better before my heart gets all melted by her.\n\nIt's very easy to fall into the trap of thinking that's what you want. It doesn't matter who you are; no one is in control. The most powerful person on Earth can't control where you'll be at the end of the night but you have the power to learn things.\n\nIf you want to have a bad time, learn how to get off. If you want to have a good time, learn how to have a good time.\n\nHow do you get better at being sexy?\n\nI've learned a lot by reading my own words. They are the worst. I didn't do enough research, I didn't use all the words that are appropriate. But that's my fault anyway: I didn't start researching at a very young age.\n\nI still regret not getting naked earlier and getting my first exposure to the idea of sex and sensuality when I was in college. I knew about pornography at the age of 12 but no one told me how I could use it.\n\nMy mom was a teacher and my grandma was a midwife and, like, they've been doing that since my grandmother was probably 13 years old. I was still growing up and I was too young to ask, \"Hey! I've always wanted to have porn!\" But what my grandma taught me was if you want to have a good time, you need to know what you're doing.\n\nShe told me to use my imagination, not her. You need to have a lot of fun, she said, and you need to have fun with women.\n\nI remember one time my grandma just walked up to someone at a party telling them that I could give them a blowjob if they wanted one. And it wasn't her. She had them walk up to me and I told them that they're beautiful and I'd love to suck their c*cks if they made a move on me.\n\nI got a few offers from women at parties, but all of them turned me down (but that's another story) and I got a lot of comments from men like, \"That's the worst I've never heard,\" or \"That's the first time I've heard of that.\" And I'm like, \"It's your choice; it's your world.\"",

      "As the year-end deadlines approach, students are bracing for their end-of-term exams as well-being.\n\nAfter a strong start to the year, and an increase in the number of students choosing not to take the end of year exams, many students want to take their time to recharge their brains before taking an examination that can dramatically affect their grade, and sometimes their entire school career.\n\nThe U.K. has the highest number of students in the world willing to forego one or more exams — a whopping 1.37 percent — which is the highest among OECD countries. That compares to 1.05 percent in Australia and one-fourth of students who declined an OECD study — a study of 14 countries. At a conference in London on Friday, the University of Westminster School of Clinical Medicine noted that the number was on the rise.\n\nThe number of students choosing not to take an end-of-year, final examination is on the rise, and the number not applying for university is on the fall. A new study by the University of Westminster School of Health Professions at the University of Westminster provides insights into the choices students are making. (Reuters)\n\nSome schools encourage students to postpone their exams through extracurricular activities, including sports (as in the case of British teenager Sami Ullah, who was suspended from his sports club for not taking his exams). But research shows extracurriculars don't usually motivate their students to go for it, and they don't improve their grades as much as taking exams. Instead, they delay and postpone to give their brains a break.\n\n[When students skip school, it can be a big problem]\n\nBut more and more students are choosing not to take exams at all. The research by the University of Westminster School of Medicine looked at 1,500 students, some of whom would choose not to take an end-of-year, final exam if they could. Students in Scotland, Wales and Ireland were excluded because their exams are optional, and the study focused only on the U.K. And students in Wales were asked their views on how much an individual exam could impact their education, the way in which they could benefit from studying an intensive course, and whether university was their \"go-to-place.\" All U.S.-resident students were included.\n\nThe researchers found that many students said they were more interested in doing something other than studying in university. And many students told researchers they would defer because the exams were too difficult or because they didn't want to take an exam on time, a type of pressure they associate more with the classroom than university. One-third were unwilling to even take the same exam as a friend, the researchers found.\n\n\"These results suggest that even a single exam can have a profound impact on student welfare,\" the study concludes.\n\n[Study: Students who took the SATs and IBs are less likely to go to college]\n\nOn the bright side, not all the students who said they were unwilling to take end-of-exams actually said they didn't want to go to university in the first place. Only 14.1 percent of students who were unwilling to take exams went directly to university. And 11.5 percent who were unwilling to take exams instead of school said they would be \"very happy\" if they had to finish up their secondary education early, and only 7 percent said they would not be.\n\nBut the majority of students who were unwilling to take exams decided to do something else with their time, the survey said.\n\nIt is not only the end-of-year exams that students are postponing. The number of students who haven't applied for university (a common reason cited by parents) fell slightly from 2012 to 2013, but it is still on the rise.\n\n[My daughter didn't get into college. So why don't I regret it]\n\nOn top of those two causes, there are other possible explanations for the declining application rates. A growing number of students are choosing not to go to university at all, for a variety of reasons. That includes opting to study abroad instead — which is growing — and because of the higher costs, the higher likelihood that they will need to borrow more money to help them finish school.\n\nAnd more young people are choosing, and completing, a second or additional degree. With the growing number of students choosing not to go to university, the United Kingdom is now the No. 3 place in the world for second-degree education, according to the International Institute of Education.",
      "The new study, published online today in Nature, suggests that the mechanism driving carbon storage could eventually be a more efficient way of reducing carbon emissions than the current system of cutting back fossil fuels and shifting more manufacturing to developing countries. The findings also help explain what is causing global warming.\n\n\"We are still a long way off achieving carbon neutrality\", says lead researcher Andreas Lehner of the Department of Physics at the University of Vienna. \"But we are starting to think about how carbon can be managed at different scales. In some ways, it is much tougher to achieve this than we thought.\"\n\nLehner and colleagues from Germany, the United States, Denmark, and the United Kingdom used computer simulations of chemical reactions to simulate how plant particles, called root exotica, capture carbon dioxide from the air and store it in underground cells where it can stay for an extended period. Previous studies have shown that leaf nodules, which grow on the stems of grasses and other plants, also are capable of storing CO 2 . In the new study, the scientists turned their attention to root exotica. That's because the plant's roots tend to be at higher latitudes and lower oxygen levels, and because their leaves, usually leaf nodules, grow on the surfaces of soil where the gases from the plant can concentrate.\n\nThe researchers focused on two ways that plants can store CO 2 in soil: by breaking up carbon dioxide molecules into oxygen and carbon monoxide molecules, and by trapping CO 2 molecules within a chemical form called carbonic anhydrase. This enzyme does not work so well in moist soils, but does work in cold soils, where it captures carbon dioxide from air as well as water. Some previous studies also have shown that trees absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere and store it in soil by releasing nitrogen that is then re-used to feed young trees.\n\nBut some experts have wondered whether plants could also contribute to the carbon sequestration process by breaking up carbon dioxide molecules and storing the carbon in their roots. The team's computer simulations showed that carbonic anhydroteases in plants capture carbon dioxide and then store it in the roots of the plants.\n\n\"At that scale, it is much more effective than carbon dioxide removal by the leaves,\" Lehner says.\n\nIn a separate experiment, the team also observed how carbonic anhydrase works in plants and animals. The team took soil samples from the United States and planted them in the laboratory. After a couple of years, the researchers found that the researchers' simulations predicted how well the plants were absorbing CO 2 from the soil, including at the roots. The team concluded that when soil gets too high in carbon dioxide, the plants and animals are able to better process it and turn it into more useful materials.\n\nLehner says that for future carbon reduction efforts, it might be useful for governments to consider both ways to sequester carbon. The researchers believe that the way to reduce carbon dioxide levels is to have a global emissions reduction, but that if people in developing nations are to reduce their use of burning fossil fuels, it should also be possible to sequester the emissions.\n\nThe scientists say that the study shows that the world is still in the early stages of understanding how carbon gets stored in soil. It also could be useful in modeling future carbon budgets, says coauthor and University of Vienna professor Stefan Bränström.\n\n\"It can also help with research into how plants and animals can both sequester carbon and how that can be combined with current carbon removal techniques,\" Bränström says.\n\nReference",
      "A Florida police department is apologizing to a 13-year-old girl after sending her threatening emails that used racial and sexual stereotypes.\n\nThe girl was one of the victims at a March incident involving St. Petersburg, St. Clair county police officer Mike Carroll told The Huffington Post on Thursday, adding that officers received the texts shortly after the story broke.\n\n\"They're sending messages to children, they are doing this on social media. … It is disgusting to us,\" Carroll said.\n\nThe texts, which have been posted to the city's Facebook page, include references to young black males, and a man having \"big black dong\" and a woman talking about \"caucasians\" having \"big balls.\"\n\nOne email was sent as a prank, Carroll said.

      "When I saw this game from a friend of mine I fell in love with it instantly. It's a super cute and easy to play game made exclusively for kids. I bought it for $.99 at Amazon's Appstore on release day. It's on sale right now for $3.99 after just over 4 days on sale ! The game is free to download and play so that should get your attention as well! I can see why it's so popular with kids. I had a blast playing this!\n\nReview\n\nGame of Life\n\nWhat is Game of Life?\n\nThe Game of Life is an endless game of matching colors to form a single pattern. The more colors you match, the bigger your game. However, the farther away your pattern is from your starting point, the more challenging your life will get.\n\nThe difficulty of the game increases exponentially the further away your pattern gets from your starting point. It is impossible to reach the furthest corners of a Game of Life board if it is at the center. If you can reach them, you gain the most points: blue = 0, green = 1, red = 2, purple = 3 and black = 4.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs in most games, players arrange colored tiles in an endless grid of 4x4 squares. In the center of each square are three blue squares, green squares and purple squares. It is impossible to move horizontally in the center without first moving one square to an adjacent piece to the right. You need to take a second step to your right first to arrange the correct combination of colors. It's not that hard so the more you play the easier it becomes! In fact, just look at this picture showing the grid above and you should be able to see that not much is needed to make the grid:\n\nEach color has its own set of three starting points. You have to match the two tiles closest to each green square to its blue square, to match the two tiles closest to each blue square to its green square and to match the two tiles closest to the black square to its purple Square. In addition, you have to match the three colors in the remaining three tiles. Since you don't need to make a matching square that connects all your colors, just have white, red, purple and black colors. White tiles and red tiles will match each other. Red tiles will match with orange and black tiles, which will match with the other two colors. If you match all the tiles in the pattern, you will end your life. However, if you get a black tile, you lose.\n\nWhy is this game so awesome?\n\nIt is just one and a half minutes of your time to learn how to play and learn how to play well, because the rules are clearly stated. And if you are familiar with the rules, you can make all the same moves you could in a normal game.\n\nEach player starts with 9 colored balls, which you can purchase with your life to start a game. You can move them around if you like, but it depends on how you use them. You can put them in the \"Lucky\" square and move them around to try to score more points than your opponent with their own colored balls. Or, you can put them in the \"Tossing\" square and toss the balls, thus scoring points by getting a piece of colored grid out of a square. However, don't do this often, or use your balls in the same square too often because the colors start getting less and less lucky.\n\nThere is also a scoring table in the board which is visible from the start of the game. There are 10 columns and 10 rows. Columns with more colors are worth more points. If you match the colors of the last column, you score 10 additional points.\n\nYou only ever get one life, so that is important to remember.\n\nIf you score 1,000 points, you win.\n\nIf you get at least one color out of all 12 columns, you score 1000 points.\n\nIf you get at least one color for all 12 rows, you score 2000 points.\n\nEven if you get all the colors with no matching in each column or row, you still win.\n\nIt is also extremely fun to see how far you have come from the start. If you have moved all the way to the furthest corner and the green square you have matched has one adjacent to it, you have won! The farther away you go, the more points you can score.\n\nThe game also works well on iPad!\n\nYou can see the screenshot below:\n\nYou can play on iPad because this version has some very nice features such as the score chart and the life counter.\n\nThis article explains all the basic Game of Life rules and what you should know before playing.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this lesson as much as I did! There is no way you could learn all these Game of Life concepts from just",
      "\nIt was a week that saw all four Republican presidential candidates in attendance for a prime-time GOP debate. But it was also a week when the Republican Party's new-found focus on the economy helped the candidates make their strongest pitch yet: that they deserve to be elected president just like every other successful politician.\n\nIt's rare to see presidential candidates taking a policy position that is as far to the right as Marco Rubio, who's pledged to dismantle the minimum wage, let student loans rise unlimited, dismantle Social Security and Medicare, and dismantle Obamacare.\n\nAnd the candidates rarely go as far as Donald Trump, who, as president, might just dismantle much of the Affordable Care Act — the signature achievement of President Obama — but also throw millions off of their health insurance.\n\nBut what the four candidates did say can only increase the chances, if they're successful in their bids, that they will be elected president.\n\nRubio: I believe the government has two basic roles in our life: We have a role in protecting lives, and we have a role in making sure that every American has a role in their own life.\n\nThat can only be good for the economy, too, because when people are living in fear and economic security, then they're not going to want to get ahead.\n\nBen Carson: It's a very difficult world out there, and if we had an intelligent government that was willing to get us out of the mess that we were in, then I actually believe that our country could thrive again — but the government won't. We have to take over that responsibility and we have to have an intelligent leadership.\n\nWe have to have policies that get us out of the mess that we're in.\n\nTrump: We will be able to pick the right people. We have to let people come in. They're coming into our country now, they're coming over to our country, they have no idea what the — what they're getting into. They have no idea. And we are losing a tremendous amount of money doing it the way it is. We need a much more selective — I'm looking only for the really good people — so that we can really help the country. And the country will be better. It'll be much better, and the country will flourish — and people can come here.\n\nThere's just one problem with that, though. The United States has much lower population growth than does Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, any of those rich nations and many others. That would have made Trump's solution more feasible in the past.\n\nRand Paul: The real solution to poverty is the free market. So, we need to have a tax that gets rid of income tax that we can't afford. We need to eliminate the IRS. There is only government money. So we get rid of that and let people set up their own businesses. But with that said, for us to be able to have a vibrant economy we've gotta have freedom of trade and a free market, people can move around and they can create jobs — they need a job.\n\nYou do not need an economic crash to create people with jobs.\n\nJeb Bush: They want to do this by making me worse, because I want to abolish government. I call it abolishing government because we get everything we need just like we got it in the 19th century. I have a plan to go back to the 19th century, 19th century values. That's what this country was founded on. That's what this country will become. And we're gonna make America great and great again.\n\nThe candidate that makes me feel safer is the person that actually understands this.\n\nChris Christie: When I'm governor, we'll repeal the death tax, and let people keep their estate tax. We'll let corporations bring back money that they're stashing overseas and use it back in America. Because what they spend in the United States should be invested here. They shouldn't be spending it on something else. They shouldn't be spending it on something else that's going to hurt us.\n\nWe want freedom and liberty. We want freedom and liberty — and our nation can be great again.\n\nMarco Rubio, when told that this question was a bit extreme, responded by saying: \"And when I'm governor, we'll repeal Obamacare as soon as we can, along with replacing it with something that's better.\"\n\nAnd they have. They've repealed Obamacare — that is, more than 50 Republican senators voted for the Obamacare repeal bill; and, for the first time in American history, Republican senators voted for a health-care bill of any kind.\n\nScott Walker added that one of the first things he would do as president is to give Americans access to medical marijuana:\n\nThe fact is, I believe in science and we don't need these crazy laws from the federal level that put people in cages for using or not using medical marijuana. I would have the Department",
      "I want you to take a moment right now. Don't worry; I'll wait.\n\nImagine that you could walk inside a wall of glass and see all the world's information—or see a single piece of it, perhaps in a computer screen. In that place, you would find yourself surrounded by thousands, if not millions of computer programs, each playing on their own program, each running a sequence of commands, each running through its own process. There would be computers, all around, connected to each other, a vast computer network, the likes of which you had never seen nor heard of, and in it all would be your friend Mark, your boss. Mark would be able to walk through the glass wall of a computer program, communicate with you electronically, and show exactly what you had done, what you'd done, what you were planning, to everybody all over the world. The computer program you had seen would exist in another, larger computer network, somewhere else in the world. It would be the product of a vast mind, a mind that was bigger in space than it was in time. All of you together, and you all in turn, all the members of the human race—or your descendants—would be living inside that giant mind as its creators imagined it, as it was intended to be. Imagine that Mark was talking to you, and that in between his words you could see the entire web of computer programs, their operations unfolding simultaneously.\n\nNow close that glass wall of glass. You see that a computer program running is always in two minds simultaneously: one in its program and the other in a remote system (the network); these two minds are usually locked in communication with each other through computers. But at any given time, there are thousands of computer programs running, one running in each mind. To one mind, Mark will always be talking to you, but to another mind, there may be a message in Mark's voice, though you, sitting here in glass, must not be able to hear it since it is in another, larger computer database.\n\nAnd as the network grew, and people started to make computers out of everything from vacuum cleaners to calculators, it became possible to imagine a world of millions of computer programs, each running somewhere else in the world, each doing some function. The whole world computer network would extend back beyond our three dimensions and reach back into the quantum realm of the smallest possible particles, the quanta of matter.\n\nNow, imagine that you could walk around this complex of millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of interconnected computers, interacting at different levels with all of the other programs running there. Your program would only be seen by computers running programs with the same name as yours; there would be no program to interact with, and no one else visible. You would therefore be able to see a world where the programs of the network were, so to speak, in an organized hierarchy, their programs all being executed from top to bottom, but the hierarchy did no more than serve as an analogy. In reality, the programs were all running together in the same system, the whole of the network being a single program that was running in two minds simultaneously.\n\nThe network of computers could become something we knew to some extent, which was the Internet. But as with the Internet, it was different from the Internet in a fundamental way. The Internet was built to connect all computing centers so that one machine could control any computer anywhere in the world at any time, so that, for example, if you were traveling across some country, you could take your laptop with you, click on a link in the middle of China, fly to Texas with it, and then land in California with your desktop computer ready to go. But the whole point of the Internet was to connect and communicate any computer anywhere by means of a computer network, a network that was much larger and much more powerful than anything that had existed before the Internet.\n\nThe Internet was a single computer network running in many different countries and many different locations. Yet this single computer network could support millions of programs, each running anywhere in the world at any time, and a central server could keep track of millions of connections over all of the computers in the network (which, by the way, were all running the same programs or were \"self-replicating\"). So, in principle, we had a single worldwide, networked computer network capable of supporting a computer network that would bring the world together. The world computer network would not have to be run along the same lines that the Internet would eventually be run; the very fact that it would be networked would make it feasible, a hundred and fifty years ago (but even now it is conceivable). But it would still rely on a particular kind of computer network, a centralized server of computers running the same kind of software and software programs that run everywhere. The centralized server would be connected to all of the computers in the network and keep track of all of the computers connected to it.\n\nThere",
      "In the final two games of the season, the Detroit Lions were forced to put themselves in a position where they needed to have faith in their defense. Without cornerback Darius Slay, their run defense was very poor as they allowed 132 yards on 39 carries against the Dallas Cowboys, and the Packers' strong rushing attack got back into the game.\n\nTheir running game was the main reason the Lions had a chance to keep from dropping in the bottom of the NFC North and finish the season with a 4-12 record, and the team kept it close enough to allow them to get some wins while hoping no one else could get close.\n\nThe Lions were able to score a couple of offensive TDs, but were able to keep out the Packers on defense. After a strong start to the season, a couple of games later they started playing much more conservative and they allowed Green Bay to run away with the game, and after the bye, Stafford and his receivers were making things go for them.\n\n\nThe Lions' offense wasn't perfect, but their defense wasn't a lot worse than any other team in the NFL. This wasn't a team that was out of place and looked unprepared when one of their stars had to go down with an injury and another who missed some time after that. As a team they did what they were asked to do.\n\nThe Lions went 7-7, not terrible, but not good enough. They are 1-5 in the games they have played with their two best players on injured reserves, and the two teams that make it to the postseason have won only three of the ten games they've played against each other. As fans, we should be celebrating the success. It's been a great season, but we are still a poor offensive team.\n\nThe Lions' Defense is a different story. If the running game isn't fixed, their defense is going to be their downfall as they can easily get dominated by a good passing team.\n\nThe Detroit Lions Defense is a mess of a unit.\n\nBefore tackling the issues with the Lions, let's take a look at their key pass rushers, which are usually the best part about their defense. First off, I would like to thank the incredible Mr. Rotoviz, who put together a table and some statistics from his study regarding who is ranked in which spot based on their pass rushing productivity as well as efficiency.\n\nYou really need to look into the stats. When looking at pass rushing stats, there are three numbers you should be concerned about – sack numbers, hits, and hurries. Sack numbers aren't directly related to how good the defense is, but they show how many times the rusher had to make a tackle to get a sack. Hurries are a measure of how good the defender was on the tackle, while hits are a measure of overall impact in getting pressure on the quarterback.\n\nWhen looking at the defensive stats, you see that the second defensive end, who may play anywhere from 0-5 tackles with 1-4 hurries, is ranked 29th in the league. Those players are a lot weaker on the defensive side of the ball than their counterparts at the other two defensive ends, and the defensive end off the bench, who might only have two to three tackles and a couple of hurries, is ranked 16th overall. That would explain why the Lions were so inept against the Packers' run game as they would only come after the quarterback and the running back only occasionally, as opposed the Packers who would rush the quarterback frequently and keep him off the field.\n\nThe defensive tackle is also ranked last overall, at just 35 for the season. Most of the names on this ranking list have been playing significant roles on their team for several years and they should still be able to perform well. Defensive tackles can be very good as long as they are consistent, but if they cannot hold up against the passing attack, they will struggle.\n\nAs for the remaining defensive end position, this is also a weak spot, with the three defensive ends ranked in the bottom 16 of the league. Not only might guys like C.J. Mosley and Nick Fairley be better in 2015, but you may also see defensive ends like C.J. Mosley, Jason Jones and Jared Odrick return on defensive line in the NFL, rather than start over in Detroit.\n\nThe final spot in the NFL for a defensive end is at tackle, for which the Lions finished dead last, while the Chicago Bears placed just above them at 19th overall. This is especially alarming due to the Lions' inability to move the pocket and their limited success on the ground this year. If the defensive end position starts to improve, then the Lions are going to be a much better unit.\n\nThe offensive line was another big issue for the Detroit Lions last season, though things are much better this year. Their sack numbers are actually better than last year in large part due to the fact that they sacked Aaron Rodgers seven more times in the two games they played",

      "\"The United States has … committed to spend more than $1 trillion on national defense in the next fiscal year, a $1 trillion increase from last year, a total for seven years higher than its historic average.\"\n\nThe president has made clear that he sees U.S. military spending as a critical component of American national security. He said as much when he said in an Oct. 28 speech before the Council on Foreign Relations that the United States must invest in its military \"like never before.\"\n\nBut we're not sure the president's words translate into spending increases. The budget Obama presented in August — and the one his administration released Wednesday — projects a small increase.\n\nThe president's $835.5 billion spending request for fiscal 2013 is about 2.5 percent lower than last year's spending plan. It's lower this year than it was in 2011 and 2012. Overall, federal spending in the United States for 2013 is projected to increase $56 billion, or 2.1 percent compared with 2012, according to the White House budget.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House released Obama's fiscal 2013 budget proposal that calls for $585 billion in spending and $46 billion in new taxes in the coming fiscal year. As many have noted, the higher budget figures put Obama's spending proposal above the 2010 \"sequester\" levels of cuts set to begin in January.\n\nThe proposal would make a big difference. The sequester, enacted in January 2011, capped defense and domestic spending at 2012 levels for the first couple of years. The budget deficit then was projected to decrease in the years that followed, but the cuts have not actually been passed or enacted.\n\nThat gap between the president's vision on \"defense spending\" and what is actually planned for next fiscal year is largely thanks to the fact that the Obama administration has not decided what to do with the reserve funds created by the 2009 economic stimulus plan. They represent nearly 10 percent of discretionary revenue, including both federal tax collections and other sources such as state and local taxes.\n\nUnder sequestration rules, the president would be required to cut back the reserve funds to zero in fiscal 2015, assuming Congress passed an identical measure for fiscal 2014.\n\nTo read more about how these reserves affect the budget and the budget debate going on in Washington, check out The Washington Post's Fact Checker column.\n\nThat means that, even with those reserves, if Congress cuts spending now, the president would have to cut back on his defense spending request from a projected $530 billion next year to about $500 billion in fiscal 2016.\n\nSo how can the president's budget be more spending than defense?\n\nThe plan released Wednesday cuts only $51 billion from the discretionary budget, which includes everything from food assistance and student grants to the arts and homeland security. That translates into a $1 billion increase, or 3.8 percent, from the proposal announced in August.\n\nBy comparison, Obama's budget proposal from August reduced spending by 2.6 percent next year, reducing spending by only $49 billion.\n\nThe plan reduces the national debt by $478 billion, a figure roughly $50 billion higher than the administration estimated it would be.\n\nThe plan would also cut taxes by $113 billion, an increase of $52 billion, including the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts. The plan calls for spending $913 billion, or 6.1 percent, on discretionary spending and $719 billion on \"taxes and revenues,\" for a total of $1.015 trillion — or 5 percent higher than the $979 billion requested last year.\n\nOn the tax side, the president would also raise taxes to close $125 billion in annual deficits. The plan would increase taxes on individuals making $200,000 or more this year and raises them by up to 5/8 of 1 percent on individuals making between $250,000 and $500,000 and by up to 2.4 percent on individuals making between $1 million and $5 million. It would also increase individual tax rates for individuals making more than $250,000. On couples making over $450,000, the tax rate would increase by 2.5 percent next year, and for households making more than $900,000, the tax rate would jump by another 2 percent.\n\nThe president would cut corporate tax rates by 5.4 percent next year, which would raise the rate on the average wage in the United States from 28.1 percent, which is the highest in the OECD, to 29.3 percent, which is the third highest. That would raise average wages by about 2.5 percent next year, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nThe White House proposes $934 billion in tax revenue, but a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimated that the tax plan could raise about $966 billion if it was fully paid for rather than relying on savings from other parts of the budget.\n\nOn Wednesday",
      "The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has ruled that a New Jersey teacher who used a sex-ed lesson to teach about \"fidelity\" may be sued by his former student.\n\nThe school district's sex-education course, developed under a 2002 state law, called \"A Child: Personal and Family Readiness,\" included a section called \"Healthy Relationships,\" according to NJ.com.\n\nThe lesson noted that \"fidelity in relationships, including sexual relations, is a very positive life skill.\"\n\nThe teacher, Michael LeBlanc, then encouraged the student to use the class to teach about the \"health risks of cheating.\" He asked his students, \"Did she cheat on you, did she lie?\"\n\nThe student then replied, \"No sir, I didn't cheat on you,\" according to court records obtained by NJ.com.\n\nWhen LeBlanc then asked his former student, who identified himself as \"Jason,\" \"did she cheat on him,\" the student replied, \"No sir.\"\n\nMr. LeBlanc then asked his students to compare Jason and the cheating boyfriend, and one student compared their sexual histories. \"Jason was a good guy,\" he said. \"He liked me for my body and my personality,\" the student said.\n\n\"I don't believe him,\" LeBlanc said, according to the student. \"Jason said he had sex with that girl [Jason, who is now 20]. That's the guy you liked then,\" LeBlanc said, according to the student.\n\nThe teacher then told the students, \"You have to take the girl with her, because if she cheats on you, you can't be on the team.\"\n\nThe district's attorney argued that LeBlanc's use of the language didn't warrant liability under the sex-ed statute, because the course wasn't mandatory.\n\nBut lawyers for the student and the student's mom brought a complaint, saying the lessons infringed on students' First Amendment rights and constituted an illegal endorsement of infidelity.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit sided with the student and the parents—including a woman who lost her job because she objected to LeBlanc's relationship-oriented lectures— arguing that the sex-ed lessons were both unconstitutional and violated the student's free speech rights.\n\nThe court also noted that the classroom discussion was not \"in any way related to the course,\" with neither the teacher nor his students offering any academic instruction. Even more telling, according to the Seventh Circuit, the students had their own teacher and even an office for the student to communicate with their parents.\n\nIn a lengthy opinion, however, Circuit Judge Susan Graber agreed that it didn't matter whether the lesson was mandatory or not for the teachers in the lawsuit because their sex-ed lessons didn't have a \"non-mandatory aspect\" because the course wasn't \"required as part of a student's formal school education.\"",

      "The United States' national men's soccer team is currently at a crossroads, having suffered a difficult 2-1 loss to Guatemala at the National Stadium in Guatemala City on Oct. 14.\n\nIt was one of only two defeats in 10 games for the Americans (4-6-2) entering Saturday's matchup against Costa Rica (11-5-4), an opponent that has scored 13 goals and conceded only three (one goal off of a red card) in seven qualifying matches. While the Americans have seen some improvements in the results column, many wonder if things are getting worse for the U.S. with the team unable to find consistency.\n\nA glance at recent U.S.-Guatemala matches can show just how much those who follow the competition feel the U.S. is struggling. The Americans were outshot 31-17 in the Oct. 15 match against El Salvador but the match was a stalemate and the win in Guatemala was only a 1-0 tie. They were also outshot 17-3 in the Oct. 15 match vs. Honduras and only a late stoppage-time goal put the Americans ahead. But the Hondurans found the back of the net through a second-half own goal in a 2-0 win at MAPFRE Stadium in Columbus five days later.\n\nThe next two games of the group stage of the tournament are just three days apart, meaning the Americans will play a two-game stretch of World Cup qualifier matches in which they have a chance to make things better. The three teams (Costa Rica, Cuba and Panama) battling for the final two spots in World Cup qualifying are the only ones to have yet to be defeated in a qualifying match. The U.S. hosts Guatemala on Sunday and Costa Rica on Oct. 21.\n\nHere are five key reasons for the U.S. men's national team and fans to have high hopes against Costa Rica Saturday in Columbus.\n\n1. There's a new man in charge ... so long, Jurgen Klinsmann. The U.S. national team had a rocky ride under Klinsmann — or, at least, the direction it was headed. And that has certainly not changed in the time since last October.\n\nWhile he might be the U.S. coach, Klinsmann has a lot to answer for. The U.S. won four World Cup qualifying games in a row only to lose and draw matches over the two consecutive weeks ending with a 2-1 loss to Honduras and then a 1-0 loss to Mexico that cost the Americans their place in next year's World Cup.\n\nAs the manager, Klinsmann could have easily gone to the coaching staff and asked them to do away with what he called \"the game plan,\" a phrase he repeated often in an interview after that Honduras loss.\n\nBut instead of taking a different approach, Klinsmann stuck with the old adage about always playing to a certain degree of comfort: He called the Mexico match the most comfortable for him in the six years he's been the national team coach.\n\nKlinsmann should have never been promoted to the top job at the age of 47, and that was largely the fault of former U.S. national team staff member Steve Sampson, who was the managing director of soccer at the time of Klinsmann's appointment.\n\n\"We made a wrong judgment in terms of the promotion of Jurgen Klinsmann. We weren't able to convince Jurgen Klinsmann to make a change,\" Sampson said last month. \"Jurgen Klinsmann has done well for the United States national team and I think at the end of the day you look at where we are as a program and we need continuity. Jurgen Klinsmann is there for a purpose. He is not doing it on his own, the players are going along for the ride but we are doing it on Jurgen's behalf.\"\n\nKlinsmann's replacement, Bruce Arena, took over for Sampson. In his first two months behind the U.S. national team bench, Arena has started off with a victory after a loss against Panama. Saturday at Columbus is only Arena's seventh game as national team coach, but he knows he has a good opportunity to show that he's the right man to take the U.S. forward.\n\nDon't expect Arena to have a long, hard look at those past losses against Honduras or Mexico. The American coach believes results are about what they are, whether they were deserved or not. His message to U.S. fans remains that you must believe too.\n\n\"I think the way we've won under Jurgen is a lot of people were wondering when this would happen,\" Arena said before a friendly in March against Bosnia and Herzegovina. \"But that's the beauty of it, if you look at who's won the games that we've not won, it's been teams that",
      "This article will show you how you could have your company pay for health insurance for your employees. And you get a few interesting bonuses for the effort! There are many benefits to having health insurance in most countries, that I have explored in many of my other articles. You will find a list of the ones in the previous link. However, there might be one you haven't considered. If the company that pays your employees for health insurance is a government entity that has a mandate for health coverage (ex. Canada and the US), then you can pay for the health insurance yourself without any tax penalties. If the health insurance is in the form of a health savings account (HSA), then you won't be taxed for the money you save, and you will be able to use it to pay for health insurance for your employees. For an employee under your company's umbrella, you may even be able to contribute up to half of the first $2,000 of salary each year toward the health care expenses of any of your employees. This is a pretty unique advantage in regards to health insurance coverage.\n\nSome people consider the HSA, a \"preferred savings vehicle\". In my opinion, these types of medical savings (aka savings in insurance), are a great way to fund your retirement! When you use the money from your HSA (or your traditional insurance) savings, you can put it in the stock market, fund a 401(k), or any other retirement asset you feel comfortable with.\n\nFirst off, lets clear out the question whether the money is \"preferred\" or not! Preference is really a question of how much tax benefit you are choosing to receive for this. The money that is put into the HSA is 100% tax deductible if you choose to take the money out of the account. It is 100%-free if you do not! So, this is all subjective. You know how you would feel about this if the tax benefit was something like half of your salary (or even less than that!). You probably don't choose to take the money out of the HSA, but I have seen this happen a couple times. I'm sure there would be people who would think this was unfair to them, and would not want the money to have come out of their savings in any way. The fact that the HSA pays for 100% of your premium, eliminates this issue, in my opinion.\n\nSo the HSA is considered as a Preference Savings Account (PSA), and is a common option for people just starting retirement. There are a number of options for HSA savings accounts in general, and you will get a lot of value out of them. To start an HSA account, you will have to decide where to set aside the money, and if you want to put in less than $2,000. You can also pay a small sum of 1% or more to be able to put in less (although no tax credits come with this option and you can't claim the tax credit for this, in which case it is zero money), or put in more money to be able to put in higher amounts. Again, you get a lot of value out of the HSA, and I would like to get more into why there might be some value in this, but it does go into more detail than you would find on the website. As with all insurance options, there are certain risks. You can go bankrupt, because you have a pre-existing condition that you need to have insurance to cover, and most employers do not want to guarantee this, especially if they have the choice of putting in a lump sum, or paying out over time. It is also important to realize that a pre-existing condition is different from some other health reason. A pre-existing condition does not really mean you have a long-term health problem, but it could mean that there is one or an issue that you have had for a long time that your doctor has never seen. It might be because your body has been rejecting drugs your doctor has prescribed, or because the drug is just not working for you. Some common pre-existing conditions are diabetes, thyroid problems, liver problems, a bad blood clotting disorder, pregnancy, etc.\n\nIf your employer offers an HSA, you will pay nothing at all to open the accounts, nor anything until you take out money. You are required to deduct your contributions from your yearly salary. If you decide to take money out of the account once a year, it will cost you 20% of your weekly pay at the time your money goes out. Once it is deposited, the amount will show up on your T4 and pay slips. For simplicity, I will assume you decide after your first year of the plan, that you want to save the additional $2,000 over your salary that the HSA pays for, and withdraw the $2,000. If your company only offers the money out in one lump sum, at tax time, you will pay a tax penalty of",
      "It's still early in 2013, but a recent Pew Research Center poll on internet privacy suggests a new divide over how much people want Google and other tech companies to take privacy into account when you click and buy stuff online.\n\nAccording to the survey (pdf), 56 percent of internet users believe Google should take \"great care\" to keep your Internet activity private, compared with 40 percent for websites to take reasonable care, and another 14 percent said Google shouldn't take any steps to secure users' online information.\n\nInternet users aren't all as confident in Facebook's online privacy as they are in those of Google and Twitter—41 percent said Facebook should take precautions, compared with the 39 percent who wanted Facebook to take no steps.\n\n(For the record, Facebook did not respond to the question.)\n\nThe poll was taken before news that Facebook was collecting the phone numbers for around 500 million people to use its new Timeline feature, according to Bloomberg. But the survey points out that it's hard to find a consistent relationship between privacy settings in different types of applications.\n\n\"When we asked about their general confidence in Facebook to keep their information private, nearly half said they had enough confidence to use it, while 39 percent had some confidence and 22 percent very little,\" the report reads.\n\nWhen asked if they wanted specific companies to secure their online information, Google and Twitter are more popular than Microsoft and Yahoo, though their proportions are quite small.\n\nThe survey results are probably no surprise to the folks at Microsoft, which has been embroiled in a privacy feud with Google since last year over a feature called Google Wallet that Google was allowing users to use to send purchases to a credit-card company's network. (A federal judge in January found the practice to be illegal.) Microsoft stopped offering the feature, and, in April, Google said it would begin allowing the feature to expire.\n\n\"We are continuing to work to create more privacy and control for our users,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars. \"Some of that work includes working with technology partners to enable users to opt-out of online service activities, and the use of behavioral advertising to serve up personalized ads that more closely align with users' interests.\"",
      "I know it's almost spring and the time with friends where we sing all the songs about how we met and have a good time together and how happy our lives will be, is always so special.\n\nBut not for this group of people.\n\nOne of the most difficult times in my life is talking about this period with other people, or with friends I may or may not meet again. You see, I was a child molester. I was a man who groomed boys, especially young girls. I was a man who got off by assaulting, torturing and abusing other human beings. My actions were not unique to our society. No more than a car accident is, no more than a fight is, no more than an assault is, there are similar events on occasion. What was unique to me was my conviction and commitment to sexual activity with children. No child should have to go through that abuse, and yet that is what I did.\n\nI learned quickly that some people would rather believe I am a monster than accept that I am human beings with the same feelings and needs as the average person. That is a choice I was never able to change. And as it should be, I will continue to stand up for those who need my support.\n\nI'm writing because of the bravery of many other survivors. They are living their truth, standing up for themselves, but not necessarily having the support of others. It is a difficult time for people who have undergone such horrible things, yet still believe in themselves and their abilities. They go about their lives, and they fight to be taken seriously, as if their wounds are nothing more than a bad haircut or a bad date.\n\nMany of their stories may seem trivial, like a funny story about a guy you dated when you were dating him and got a job offer, or some such, but it does not matter, this is a commonality. You cannot escape the fact that child abuse happens throughout society, and that for some there are very powerful forces to protect other people with impunity. It is very hard to talk about, but at the same time it is important to understand that the child molester/rapist is not unique, and there is a name for this phenomenon: power-abuse. In fact, it is not the power that he or she has, or the ability to inflict violence on others, but the desire to wield power as a means to exert control.\n\nI have chosen here to focus on the male sex offenders, because that is what most people associate the most with child molestation in the media today. But that is not entirely right. There are females that sexually abuse children, and I see no reason why we should exclude them from the conversation when other men abuse their bodies to molest others. I have also chosen to focus here on those who abuse children who are younger than 8, in order to keep from trivializing the issue. What I don't want to do, however, are minimize the seriousness of the abuse, or the harm done to the child.\n\nI have found it difficult to write the past on paper. It should have been so simple. Just get treatment, get it done, leave the pain behind, and I would do the same. I would be as willing as anyone to believe that this is simply a bad haircut. I would see it as another day, another haircut, another boy. But instead, I am forced to write this, because it is the truth.\n\nI have heard a few people, both men and women, say \"Oh my God! He doesn't look like a child molester. He must be fine and it does not look that bad on him.\" I would beg to differ. This is not a joke. I can see no light in his eyes. I see no compassion in his soul. I don't understand why anyone would want to treat him in a positive light at this point.\n\nSo, yes, this is real. I am writing this to show others who would have never experienced the pain I did, the darkness that I have seen, just how difficult the path has been. I hope that if someone has this experience they will see why it is important to be open and honest about the abuse itself.\n\nI wish someone had told me all this years ago, so I could have had at least a small amount of peace. I wish I knew the answers now, at least some of them, and could put them back together and make sense of everything that has happened. I know that those of you who are still living with your past and who have not spoken about it, don't know what pain exists until you feel it. And I know that this is also true for you. It may take time for us to learn what we need to understand, what it means to be OK.\n\nI would like to offer a sincere thank you to those of you who have reached out to me, and to those who have encouraged me to continue the conversation. I am",
      "The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on Friday, July 2, dismissed a lawsuit concerning the legality of the U.S. federal government's ability to forcibly send unaccompanied minors by the tens of thousands across its border with Mexico.\n\nCristóbal J. Moreno-García, the judge who heard the case, issued a scathing dissent, criticizing the majority opinion as \"not only a travesty of a reasoned opinion, [its] reasoning is riddled with errors, misstatements of law, and unjustified judicial assertion of law,\" and he concluded that the case is likely to be quickly dismissed. In Moreno-García's view, the administration's policy is so outrageous as to be \"bordering on the illegal.\"\n\nIn this column, the Center for Immigration Studies senior fellow Katherine Mangu-Ward offers some analysis of the case against the Obama administration — and the possible outcomes — as well as reasons why the ruling may come too soon. If the court upholds the Obama administration's policy, what will \"undocumented\" migrants be permitted to do? And what will they be able to do to secure their futures?\n\nMangu-Ward offers these answers and more in her article, \"Moral Hazard,\" below:\n\nIn this post, we offer an analysis of recent statements made by President Obama about the border crisis in response to questions at the annual White House correspondents' dinner. In his remarks, the president said:\n\nThe most important thing we can do is to secure our borders. And while everybody's got to do a little bit more on immigration reform, and we've done our part, let's figure out how we enforce the law. But there is an easy fix that is going to make a big difference… As soon as I see children coming to this country, and as fast I get in our administration — I meet with my attorneys and our officials are reviewing policies that are already in place, I do not have to go back to the Congress to get a new bill. It's already going through the Senate. I will sign a comprehensive immigration bill. That bill will include a path to citizenship — and that's something nobody's ever done before.\n\nThat's a clear and decisive statement. To say that securing our borders is enough – that securing our borders is the best thing that can be done to solve the immigration crisis – is a statement that defies easy analysis. This is especially true when one considers the way in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has ruled in a series of immigration lawsuits brought by children crossing our border with Mexico to avoid being sent back to their parents in Mexico.\n\nIn most of the cases, the U.S. district court judges who have presided over the cases have sided with the Obama administration when it comes to the administration's position that children's families must be separated from each other. That is, if they can be separated from their family members, then they must be separated from each other. And in these appeals, judges have ruled against the government's \"safe harbor\" approach, which would grant the U.S. government the authority to grant temporary permits to illegal aliens in order to allow those individuals to remain in the U.S. without fear.\n\nTo be clear, the appeals court rulings are not always a vote in favor of the immigration \"reform\" the Obama administration has been advocating. In fact, quite the contrary. In the past 5 cases, appeals judges have allowed the administration to avoid an immigration review by declaring that the administration's policy did not have the potential to drive the border \"dangerously out of bounds.\" So, if someone arrives with children already in custody, the government can let them stay, even if the children and their families may have been brought over here in violation of U.S. immigration law. And the court has even allowed for the administration's \"safe harbor\" approach to stay. In one of the cases involving the \"safe harbor\" approach, the court held that there was no proof that the \"safe harbor\" was necessary to allow unlawful immigrant children to stay in the country.\n\nIt appears that these rulings have been influenced by the fact that the appeals court majority has a conservative reputation. Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who is also President Barack Obama's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, is a close personal friend to Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. A couple of weeks ago, Abbott tweeted that Judge Barry was an \"upstanding member of the legal community.\" Abbott went on to write that she \"will always support Judge Barry.\"\n\nThis is just the latest evidence that the Obama administration has made tremendous efforts to appease liberals in general as well as those in the immigration advocacy community. Obama has made several statements about \"reforming\" the immigration system in ways that the \"legal\" community and media are supportive of, yet the American people don't agree with. As we have written about previously, the Obama administration is committed to an overly expansive interpretation of its interpretation",

But again, that was denied by Danish goalkeeper Nicolai Johansen, who was forced to make a couple of saves in the game.\n\nHowever, a brilliant play in the 79th minute saw Litmanen take an amazing shot that was only saved by Johansen on the goal post.\n\nThe Czechs came close to doubling their lead in extra time in the 90th minute when Jan Paluska headed the ball into the net after a brilliant sequence of pass and shot from the right side.\n\nWith six minutes to go Czechs, the Czech Republic, Norway, Slovenia and France will kick this World Cup Playoff round off on France.\n\nThe Czech Republic will close out their game vs. Denmark this Friday at 8:30pm with their match vs. France, the final match of Group B, also at 8:30pm in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Czech Republic and France will wrap up Group B on June 4, with a play-in round match taking place in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn the Czech Republic's last game vs. Norway on May 31, they fell in a thriller 4-1, putting them at the bottom of Group B with all three points.

      "How do you use a knife (with or without a handle?\n\nThe basic principles are the same though. In fact, many traditional and modern knife makers use the words \"throwing knife\" and \"throwback blade\" interchangeably.\n\nA knife designed with a handle has many advantages over a similar knife without: One, you're not necessarily going to hold it when you're throwing it – so there are no chances on messing up the handle or cutting yourself. Two, with or without a handle, you can't accidentally throw it on your head when you're jumping from a bridge. Three, throwing it is very versatile. You could also easily set it down on a table and use it as a chopstick for soup, or keep it next to your bed, where the sun will burn through your jeans the next morning.\n\nNow let's talk about how to use a knife without a handle or handle with a handle.\n\nThere are three basic principles to keep in mind when using a knife with a handle:\n\n1. Keep the knife at an angle to the ground when throwing it.\n\nIf you're throwing it at an angle, it will have a better chance of catching a fish. For example, if you're throwing it towards water that is above your waist height – like a pool – you need to take the knife out of the water and hold it from side to side. It should have a constant angle between you and the water that is at least 3 to 12 degrees from horizontal.\n\n2. Let go of the knife once you're throwing.\n\nIf you think \"I'm just going to hold this down and throw it\" you're going to be disappointed. If you let go of the knife too early you're going to let the fish swim right up to the handle.\n\nHere are two video on this, \"let go and release with your hand on top of the knife,\" principle:\n\nIf you can get this right you will have the knife going in a straight line, so you're avoiding the problem of not catching the fish in the middle of the boat or in the ocean.\n\n3. Place the knife in and out of the water repeatedly until you're ready to throw it.\n\nJust like when throwing, you need to start with a steady hand (not grabbing for the line or something like that) and throw the knife at a consistent angle for a little while. Don't have the knife in the water when you just throw it. It's too hard to catch the fish.\n\nPracticing with your knife is always a good idea. It will help you get the timing down. And don't forget about the \"drop-in\" technique that I talked about below.",

      "I love the little things in life. Like the smell of freshly baked choco cake. How about the fact that you were the last person I called last night, or that I just really like this pair of socks I found at the hardware store. There's so many things that are great about life that I have yet to share. To me, the things that make me happy are the things that no one else seems to experience. I am, after all, lucky. That's what makes me happy. I want to share the things I think make me happy as often as possible. You won't believe what I think is the greatest gift ever…\n\n3% of everything we buy goes directly to one cause and organization. One, The Red Cross.\n\nSeriously. It's only 3%…\n\nThis has become a huge part of my life recently. At the beach with the family I usually spend a good 30 minutes talking about the wonderful things that this charity does for our community and all over the world. My favorite thing to talk about is how I believe that if everyone donated one dollar of every item they purchased to The Red Cross I would be able to literally double that amount very soon. This charity gives to EVERYONE and I have no doubt in my mind that if you donate 3% of everything you purchase, you can double the money you are giving without having to give away any of your time or money.\n\nWhat are You Giving?\n\nJust kidding. You won't be able to double your money. So, while you are donating, think about what you are giving away.\n\nYou can check out some of the great organizations that The Red Cross gives to here. If you are going through rough times, this could be a life saver. The National Organization for Women (NOW) is a 501(c)(3) organization that is committed to equal pay for equal work. There's even the AID (American Enterprise Institute ) which is dedicated to finding opportunities for America's young women and girls.\n\nThe Red Cross doesn't just give to one organization, they donate to all over the world. I am not even joking…it's amazing what they spend the money on every day. You're going to be amazed by the things they don't.\n\nAs you can see I am not including food or other necessities on the list of items that they donate to. It does make a difference in how much money The Red Cross spends, so I included it and it didn't cost me too much. You might not be able to afford that…but you can certainly buy a couple of things in your budget that are amazing for the world.\n\n3-day holiday gift sets\n\nI am a big kid.

      "The US Army is set to announce that the M109A6 Paladin has arrived in Aberdeen, ahead of an initial deployment to Poland, in support of NATO's enhanced Forward Presence in Europe.\n\nThe Paladin was developed in the 1930s as a light-weight, one-piece, wheeled tank that could move easily through forests, fields, and cross-country roads. When new, the M109A6 was known as the \"M4\" in Europe, and the Army still uses the model on its M113 models.\n\nIn March, US Central Command (Centcom) announced the deployment of 12 additional M109A6s to the 34th Army Group as part of its enhanced Forward Presence in Europe mission that supports coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Paladin, with its advanced technologies, weapons, and crew, is designed to meet a range of operations against both a direct enemy threat and from the rear, supporting a rapidly deployable force.\n\nThe new deployment to Poland is part of a phased deployment of the Paladin on six vehicles. This deployment includes an additional 10 Paladin vehicles in Lithuania, Romania, and Poland. More Paladin vehicles are being delivered to support this deployment, and all of the US Soldiers who will use the Paladin will be equipped with US-manufactured Mk19 30mm. gun modules and M203 grenade launchers.\n\nThe initial vehicles are being delivered to NATO countries, but are also being deployed to several other potential users, including the Polish Army, with the addition of the 1st Cavalry Division, as well as some units and elements of the Lithuanian 3rd Infantry Division, to the Paladin deployment.\n\nThis deployment will support the enhanced Forward Presence mission in Europe and its partners throughout the Alliance through interoperability, interoperability demonstration, and partner readiness improvements.\n\nM110A1\n\nIn addition to the Paladin, a new version of the M110A1 tank is entering service to replace the M108 model deployed in Afghanistan. The M110A1 features a new turret and hull configuration designed to improve its accuracy under adverse conditions.\n\nThe main weapons are a 90mm M1A1 Cannon and a 30mm M2HB Heavy Machine Gun. The M109A1 was developed from the M101A1, a predecessor to the M108A1 tank, and is a multi-mission, armored wheeled tank with a 105mm gun or the heavier 130mm M1 Gun, either as a main weapon or in the 120mm gun turret.\n\nA total of 2,060 M108A1s are currently being used by the US Army in Afghanistan, while another 1,240 M109A1s are in the pipeline.\n\nThe new M110A1s are being built by General Dynamics Land Systems Inc. in Lima, Ohio and will be built at the LTV Tank Plant in Lima, Ohio. General Dynamics has delivered some of the first tank production M110A1s to the US Army.\n\nThe M110A1 will replace the M109A1, along with the M109A3 (currently in Vietnam), and the M109A5 (currently in Afghanistan), and could also replace the M113. There are plans to convert some of M113s to M105A1s, which have a 105mm gun instead of the 120mm, to improve mobility and survivability, but the M110A1 will take over much of the M107 capability now in service.\n\nM109A2\n\nThe other long-range vehicle to be replaced in Afghanistan is the M109A2. With a total of 3,520 units built since it was introduced in the war in Iraq in 2003, the M109A2 is manufactured by General Dynamics Land Systems in Lima, Ohio. The first of the 3,260 M109A2s introduced in Afghanistan has been withdrawn, however one of the tanks could be delivered to a possible future use in Afghanistan, depending on future troop levels.\n\nThis system of vehicles, which features a 120mm gun, improved suspension and steering, has been in service since 2003. Its main weapon is the M240 machine gun with a crew of two. While the weapon system has proven effective in Afghanistan, a significant risk is its poor reliability in snow, muddy conditions, and high temperatures.\n\nWhile in service, the M109A2 has been involved in more than 130 accidents, and a recent report from Defense News suggested other Army systems were also being \"unreasonably\" prone to failures.\n\nM109A2s can also be equipped with a 120mm gun turret – the current configuration, but not the newest version of the M109A2.\n\nThe Marines will also receive at least six M109A2s, with the vehicles equipped with an M240 cannon and two 30mm M2HB Heavy Machine Guns.\n\nM109A3\n\nThe Marines currently have a number of M109A3s in Afghanistan with one being withdrawn in the coming",

      "\"A man was murdered and his girlfriend was raped in her home. Police investigated, found a gun, and the home was put up for sale. Police tracked down the buyer and killed him. A jury in California, without knowing about the murder weapon, sentenced the seller to spend 24 months in jail because the house was dangerous.\"\n\nThe statement is false. The sentence was not because the home was hazardous. The murder weapon was never found. Instead, the sentence was for a second-chance home repair scam that started as a house warming party but ended in the death of a man and his girlfriend.\n\nOn Monday, August 30, 2010, a man named Timothy Brown was killed and his girlfriend raped while they slept in their room at a condominium in Riverside, California. An intruder broke in while the couple was having sex. The defendant, Robert Scott Green, entered the room with the intention of hurting both of the victims, only to find that the bedroom lights were still on. He turned on a flashlight and attempted to rape the victim, only to have the woman kick him out of the room and alert the cops. The responding officers found evidence of sexual assault, including a condom on the woman's body. Officer John Coronado reported, \"Both parties had injuries consistent with rape\" but the woman had no injuries consistent with \"forced entry.\"\n\nWhen Green's co-defendant, Steven Cuff, was arrested soon thereafter, police learned that the couple had been living in squalor. The laundry room had just one bed, a bathroom with the lid missing, and a dirty room with dirt sheets on the bedding and the floor. The bathroom and kitchen had no running water, the bedroom had no furniture and the front door had been left open. There were no working water, sewer or electricity lines in the three rooms. All of the windows had been boarded up or boarded up incorrectly.\n\nWhen police spoke to the woman living in Green's room, she claimed that the men were the ones who forced their way into the room and raped all three of them. Later, Green admitted to the murder and rape by telling her he only admitted to them because he wanted her to take responsibility for them. He said, \"I want you to take responsibility, to accept your fault. It's not fair that you sleep with me and I have to take responsibility for it, and I'm sorry for everything.\"\n\nIn June 2015, a California jury convicted Green of first-degree and second-degree murder, assault with a deadly weapon without intent and kidnapping. The murder weapon was a gun that Green apparently brought from his home in San Diego where the murder weapon had been abandoned. The murder was committed while the apartment was being offered for sale in a county that has \"just cause\" requirements. The defendant was convicted of murder but not of rape in a case that was very unusual in the annals of criminal justice and the media.\n\nGreen is likely to go to jail when he is released after serving two-thirds of his sentence. The second-chance home repair scam, as described by the defendants, is a scam that originated in San Diego. The scam began as a \"halloween-type\" holiday called \"Halloween for Pets' Day\" at the same apartment building where Green and Cuff lived. Green began the scam with the promise to fix the kitchen's leaky faucet, fix a broken fridge and fix a leak in the bathroom's shower in exchange for $300 (which would be paid by the victim later, but not in time to prevent the murder). According to Green, the apartment manager told him to call back on Halloween and he would do the job for a \"little extra.\"\n\nAt this point, Green became concerned that his customers wouldn't be able to get their work done. He said, \"I thought, if I wait until after to see if anyone calls, maybe they'll call again and there still wouldn't be a job done.\" So, he decided to add a requirement to the scam by asking the customers to provide their home phone number and a $80 deposit in order to obtain a job done.\n\nHe then demanded an additional $15 in deposit if the job wasn't done and an additional $80 if it was done, along with a one percent fee on future bills that were subsequently paid. He told the customers that if they got the job done within two weeks they'd get the money back plus their deposit back plus a $60 credit. When Green had finished doing work on other customers' homes, he told his victims that they could get their refund back plus his fee plus additional $60 on top of their deposit. \"If I don't get it done within a week, I don't get any money.\" According to testimony by the former victims, Green told two of them that if they didn't return the work, he would pay someone else $100 to find a job faster. He charged both customers $100 on two different occasions, but when they called him to tell",
      "Borussia Dortmund has been forced to delay their UEFA Champions League quarterfinal second leg against Bayern Munich as the Bundesliga club was hit by technical problems from Wednesday evening. There has also a chance that the player with the most number of Champions League appearances during the career of Bayern's current manager Pep Guardiola (26) could miss Dortmund's clash.\n\nDortmund was first to suffer technical issues on Wednesday night, as the Bundesliga side suffered technical failure during the second half of their match against BATE Borisov. The stadium then received even more severe problems and in the meantime, the match was called off, with Bayern going 2-2, thanks to goals from Javi Martinez, Marco Reus and Thomas Muller.\n\nWith Bayern now having to play away next week, the players are now considering all possible ways of stopping the Bavarians from becoming the first European club ever to win two successive titles, since they did so back in 2009 and 2011. Dortmund, however, have already announced that their remaining Champions League matches may be postponed, which could mean another two weeks off from soccer for Guardiola in Germany's top competition.\n\nDortmund are still hoping to reach the Champions League finals if they can play Bayern without any problems, and have been left without any options when problems from Wednesday, when the stadium was hit by a large fire at the nearby stadium site in the early hours of the morning, took the worst aspect of both the match and Dortmund's situation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dortmund and their fans were lucky to see some light at the end of the tunnel as the club announced that the game will still go ahead, but at an \"unfavorable time\".

      "In the first two decades after World War II, the vast majority of women lived in countries that allowed abortion. But after 1973—when the United Nations voted to declare its \"decisive success\" in banning anti-choice laws—the world began to shift. Some 50 countries have adopted abortion bans by imposing criminal prosecution of the procedure. In the United States, meanwhile, the right to choose the timing and method of delivery in cases of rape and incest became a right recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992.\n\nThe United States was the world's first country to enact women's rights laws that included abortion regulation. By the end of the twentieth century, more than 75 percent of women worldwide lived in liberal and socially democratic countries that allowed abortion. By 2011, over 75 percent of women lived in countries that criminalized its use.\n\nWhile the rights of women have steadily improved around the world, the situation remains fraught with injustice when it comes to women seeking abortions. In many countries, women are still criminalized under their own government's laws, even though many liberal countries explicitly outlaw criminalization of abortion. The only legal, legal abortion services in many developing countries are provided through the public health system, at very high cost.\n\nIn other cases, women have been driven underground by oppressive governments, which often treat the procedure—and the women who rely on it—like a \"social evil.\"\n\nIn the United States, the right to care for one's reproductive system was enshrined in the Constitution. And since the Roe v Wade decision in 1973, more than 40 states have recognized this right. Today, about 150 million women experience unplanned pregnancy. The United Nations estimates that an additional 800 million women worldwide also struggle under high costs and unmet healthcare needs.\n\nSo it was that on February 16, 2012, the Center for Reproductive Rights, along with our international partners, filed a challenge to laws that force women to carry pregnancies to term against their will from other countries through criminal prosecution. We hope to see our case go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBecause of the critical nature of our defense, we have secured some important support from groups with deep connections to reproductive justice. The Center's challenge, known as the International Human Rights and Women's Rights Initiative, has received support from Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Women's Dignity Institute, and Women for Women International.",
      "When you're an aspiring writer, you want to write a book that the world will look back on and say 'she got it right.' When you're a writer who isn't an aspiring writer, you want to get every little book right and get in and out of the library on a regular basis.\n\nThe trouble is, most aspiring writers aren't really aspiring writers. I hate talking about how not-an-ambitious writer I am, and I should probably stop it. I don't have the chops for that sort of thing.\n\nA writer doesn't have to get the book right. Writing is a process that changes you. It takes you from good to great, for better or worse. I'd suggest that you don't waste your time trying to write a bad book, or hoping that the first couple of dozen hours on a blank page will somehow result in greatness. You're going to have to start with your book, and not get stuck on minor details. Here are some guidelines for starting out on your quest for greatness:\n\nPick your story. The story isn't something you read for structure or a plot. It's a way to express who you're and how you think. Your story is the catalyst for your book. It's the beginning, middle, and end, and sometimes it might look different depending on the world you're writing in. If you're writing on or in Earth, the story will likely be about people and creatures who exist in a more complex environment. Your story is going to be about what makes people who they are, what drives people to be good, and what makes them want to do bad things. Your story must be rich, interesting to the point that I want to see it through. There's a very simple trick when it comes to picking a story to create: look at that story you just read. Look at everything it had to do to get where it was.\n\nHave fun. Writing is work. Writing is hard. It takes a lot of time and practice, and sometimes you have to ignore the world and live like a peasant. You have to be comfortable being uncomfortable, if you ever want to get good at it.\n\nYou don't have to wait until your book is finished to start reading what you got written. Go read it online and then read it again. See if you can read your book in different ways, in different words, in different voices. Read your book all the way through to the end, maybe one-shot it. Look for places where the book gets you to dig deeper into something. What made you want to write that part of the story? Write that part and get ready to read it in a different way. Read your book until it hits you where you want it to hit you.\n\nYou can read another book. You just have to find that story. It has to be there before you start.\n\nIf you want to give your writing a shot, there are no shortcuts. You have to put in the work. You have to give up something. You have to make a lot of changes.

There are many different types of parts to have in a car, and some have been tested and are approved by some regulatory bodies. Some parts are made in Europe, including some transmissions and drive shafts, and some parts are made in the US, including some parts of the powertrain and exhaust system, and some parts of the engine itself, and others parts are international. The parts most likely to require regulatory approval are the engine management software (EMS), the fuel mixture switch (FMS), and the drive systems (DME) and the engine control unit (ECU).\n\n2. The EMS works by communicating with the car's electronic control units (ECU, DME, powertrain control unit) and various various sensors that collect information about the car's location and performance. By adding and controlling sensors during the car's operation, the EMS can provide the car with much more accurate data about the car's power production and engine load. When the power unit is not responding to the signals from the EMS, a number of things can occur as a result: the car may be operating incorrectly, the car may have been left idling and is therefore generating significantly less power than indicated by the EMS, the engine speed may actually be lower than indicated by the EMS; the EMS may not know how to calibrate, or perhaps the EMS, due to its complexity can be slow at reacting to changing conditions and conditions may change during the period the EMS was calibrating. If the EMS cannot see the car's performance, then there are two things that can happen: the EMS may not work at all, or the car may run more slowly when it should not.\n\n3. Before a vehicle can be certified, it must undergo several safety measures. The vehicle must have at least two of the following things, or it will not go over its safety requirements: at least one air bag; an automatic transmission (AT) or continuously variable transmission (CVT); an automatic braking system (ABS); electronic stability control (ESC); a generator; an air conditioning system; an electronic fuel injection sensor (EFI) in the fuel tank; an air conditioning control circuit; an ignition system that uses a fuel injection sensor; a catalytic converter or a device that captures exhaust emissions; and a safety/security system. Additionally, a vehicle must have at least one of the following: a trunk door lock device, or an alarm system; an emergency brake module that will turn off the vehicle's engine if the key fob and ignition switch are not in the 'on' position; or other safety devices (such as a locking device that allows the keys to be stored away from the ignition). Lastly, the vehicle must be tested against the appropriate safety standards, including the Canadian Standard for Vehicles of Special Interest for Safety and Security, SAE J211E-03, The Canadian Standard for Vehicles with Specific Requirements, SAE J211E-05.\n\n4. As a rule, all new cars must be tested against the Canadian Standards (CSIC) which are based on the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The CSIC are intended for cars that are currently sold in the United States that are on the market at the time the car tests are performed.[1] Once the Canadian CSIC is completed, a vehicle must be tested with the U.S. Standards; if the vehicle is sold through Canada it does not always require the U.S. Standards, and it depends on the Canadian market. The Canadian Standards are similar to the FMVSS and both can be applied to some cars, but there are two major differences: The Canadian CSIC has requirements from the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The U.S. FMVSS has requirements from European Safety Law and regulations.\n\n\nAdditionally, some Canadian Standards are for vehicles of general interest, such as those for emergency or security vehicles and those for vehicles that perform other functions.\n\n\nOnce the Canadian CSIC has been completed, the vehicle must be tested in Canada.",

      "Dogs will go through some pretty incredible phases as they grow up. Some are excited, some are anxious, some are downright frightened, but most of us are well aware of the time and stress it takes from when a dog was a puppy. Dogs grow, and even grow a bit too fast. They grow their ears, their bodies, their minds – but they also grow their teeth, which can grow from a size a human would find ridiculous to something we'd find pretty easy to deal with.\n\nIt looks like an adult dog can grow up to a whopping 1,200 teeth in just 10 years. The average human grows about 250, according to this article, and a human baby growing up to 8-10 pounds (it's estimated he had between 500-700 teeth at the time of his birth – and growing).\n\nAnd that's just the starting end. At age 2, a typical adult can have about 300-500 teeth.\n\nAnd that's just the start.\n\nNow it's our turn.\n\nHow Much Dental Care Do Dogs Need?\n\nThere are many different types of dental care for dogs, such as root canals, extractions, crowns, or both, which we will talk about in the next section. You can also opt for preventive or restorative dental procedures like dental implants. In fact, some of the most common dental diseases in dogs are caused by poor oral health conditions.\n\nDental health conditions can be hard to spot even when they are getting serious. To help prevent or treat a number of them, check out our guide for the Top 10 Most Common Dental Care Issues in Dogs.\n\nHow Will My Dog Live Without His Dentures?\n\nYour dog most likely will never grow out of the dental health problems he's dealing with now. The good news is most canine dental conditions can be completely remedied by early oral health care.\n\nA dog without braces or mouthfuls of teeth in his mouth may look a little disheveled, with loose teeth and gums. But dogs with these dental issues will live a better life than most people.\n\nMost dentists recommend getting a puppy who weighs around 1-1.5 pounds when they start to brush and floss his teeth (and also when he loses those teeth and starts to lose them). This will build up your dog's dental health a bit, and when it's time for his teeth to be fully grown, you can replace them.\n\nIf a dog's teeth do grow naturally, he probably won't need any dental care. Dogs who live their entire lives with a denture or mouthful of teeth tend to have a number of dental health issues due to the size of their teeth and lack of dental care around the time their teeth first formed.\n\nWith time, they can become bigger than you would imagine (even dogs who have been around puppies for years and have lost their teeth may still be getting bigger and larger over time, according to the National Dental Association), which can make their mouths even harder to clean.\n\nWhen to Stop Brushing and Flossing\n\nYou don't need to regularly pull your dog's teeth out or replace them. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that unless these things are causing your dog any distress, and you need to help him out by providing dental care to keep him comfortable.\n\nThe American Dental Association recommends that the average pet dog be braced, with his entire mouth restrained at all times for about 15 seconds every hour until age six. After that, the routine is to brush once every three days before bed.\n\nAt some point, your dog probably will have to stop doing these things, but it may never be a huge issue. In fact, the average American dog has between 20-35 thousand teeth by their 6th birthday.\n\nYour dog may be able to survive without braces or braces while he lives in a home with proper hygiene, unless things are really out of control, or it's affecting your dog in a way he isn't having fun with or comfortable with.\n\nDogs who get regular dental care are more likely to keep the smile on their faces and look less like they've gone to the dentist.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBraces and braces aren't always the answer, and they won't fix everything. But they can help keep teeth looking great and protect teeth from growing out of shape or breaking (or falling out).\n\nIf your dog is having problems with your teeth or other dental health complaints, talk to your dog's veterinarian. They can come up with a plan that will help, and if you don't get it right off the bat, you may need dental care later on.\n\nAnd remember, it doesn't hurt to spend some money on healthy chew toys or chew sticks to encourage good brushing and flossing habits. If you use them, your dog will thank you for it.",

      "An ancient stone tablet is being sought for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as part of a legal battle by the Jewish family of a man who was shot dead in a Chicago park with a knife in 2015 while he held a placard.\n\nA man with a knife is attacked by a victim with a placard in the middle of the Grant Park Conservatory on June 1 2016, when a protest against police brutality erupted. AP / Jim Young for The New York Times\n\nChicago police officers have charged two black men with murder in the June 1 fatal stabbing of an unarmed 20-year-old with an American flag placard in Chicago's Grant Park as protesters protested against police killings of unarmed men in Louisiana and Minnesota.\n\nJuan Thompson was fatally shot while holding a flag carrying an image of Donald Trump during a protest marking the one-year anniversary of the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Mr. Thompson had a history of mental illness and an arrest for domestic battery, according to a criminal complaint filed by a Chicago police officer.\n\nMr. Thompson, who lived in Chicago's southwest suburbs, was among the many Americans marching across the nation's capital and elsewhere to decry racial inequality and police brutality on June 1, 2016, in reaction to the police killings of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge on similar demonstrations.\n\nRelated Video Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announces the launch of an investigation into what happened on the day that Chicago officers shot and killed 22-year-old Tony Robinson, a black man with a suspended license who lived in the Chicago suburb of Oak Lawn. Photo: Getty\n\nAs demonstrators marched, they shouted that Mr. Thompson had a gun and said he was shot when he reached into his waistband, according to a news release from the prosecutor's office. Chicago police officers said at the time of the shooting that Mr. Thompson had threatened them with a knife when they responded to a call from another patron, whom police say Mr. Thompson was threatening. The man was not present at the time of the shooting, police said. The officer who fired at Mr. Thompson has been placed on unpaid leave pending an investigation.\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has said that the officers who shot Mr. Thompson were justified and should not face criminal charges because they believed the threats that the man had made. The man, who is black, was carrying a pocket knife and was armed with a pocket knife and a flag in a \"protest environment\" that was \"dangerous and extremely violent,\" according to the criminal complaint, which said Mr. Thompson tried to \"mow down people.\"\n\n\"We can only hope this is resolved on a legal basis,\" said Richard Moskowitz, a lawyer for Mr. Thompson's family.\n\nThe Chicago Park District is seeking return of the stone tablet bearing the words, \"In the names of our fathers, brothers, and sons, we will fight against all hate and violence,\" as part of a legal battle. The tablet was a gift to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1992 from the Israeli government.\n\n\"If there's some justice, that monument will be returned to the people of Israel for burial and it will be given back to Chicago City Hall for a museum that reflects reality and human history,\" said Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nMr. Thompson's mother, Barbara Thompson, said she has been unable to contact her husband since the shooting and that he had been receiving visits occasionally. He is survived by his wife, a brother, and two sisters.\n\nIn a 2015 interview, Mr. Thompson said that he was depressed and had schizophrenia and had been hospitalized several times for psychiatric treatment, including as recently as 2009. \"I know what a bomb is but I don't know how to build one, and if I build it, I blow a hole in the ground,\" Mr. Thompson said then, according to the Tribune.\n\nPolice have not identified any suspects and said they were looking for a group of nine males who jumped the fence and ran into the park after being confronted by police. Officers on patrol heard shots and saw one man carrying a handgun, police said.\n\nSince June 1, more than 200 protesters have been arrested and some 10 officers wounded.\n\nTwo people who live in Oak Lawn have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city, arguing that they were wrongly targeted when the protests broke out because of the area's predominance of African-Americans. According to the lawsuit, the city \"has engaged in a deliberate pattern of discrimination\" by restricting access to parks, traffic islands, and other public facilities.\n\n\"The city's continued and willful policy of keeping black people out of city parks is patently and blatantly unconstitutional, and this lawsuit is intended to hold the city accountable for its unlawful discrimination in violation of equal protection law,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nAssociated Press",

      "The best place to start when learning how to program is with an introduction. To help readers get into the habit of learning by programming, let's give a short introduction by showing them what programming is, what the language is called, and what it looks like when all that's involved is an interpreter that executes the program and interprets its output, called the compiled program.\n\nWhat is programming?\n\nProgramming in computer science involves performing a set of computational operations on one or more inputs or outputs. The programming language used is a representation of this data which may contain variables and procedures, and can communicate with the computer by sending and receiving data. There are three main types of programs commonly used: the executable, the interpreted, and the compiled.\n\nA compiled program is a program (in this example one that prints \"Hello, World!\") built up from an interpreter (i.e. program written in machine language) and the actual data that the interpreter outputs (also known as the machine code).\n\nThe machine code in the output of a program is the same as the program code, only it is represented in machine syntax. When the actual implementation is implemented by a computer instead of by a human, this representation allows the computer to run the program much faster than a human would have been able to do without it. This is done by translating the instructions, or the instructions as they happen to look (i.e. the machine code), into instructions that are both correct and fast.\n\nWhat is an interpreter? A program written in machine code (a binary number sequence) consists of instructions that can be run by means of the programming language. The instruction set of the programming language is known as the standard. The interpreter translates the instructions that are part of the standard into a form in which they can be run by the computer. A machine is a tool that converts input to output and can be thought of as a translator between machine syntax and computer syntax, translating the input from a format in which it can be processed by a computer to another format in which the computer can process it.\n\nIf we have an executable program, it looks something like this:\n\nint main (void) { printf(\"Hello, World\n\n\"); return 0; }\n\nAnd here are both the first and the second part of the program after translation by the interpreter:\n\nint main (void) { int i = 12; printf(\"In case you're wondering, I'm a real program: %d\n\n\", i); return 0; }\n\nAfter translation by the interpreter, the resulting executable program is:\n\nint main (void) { char *p = \"Hello, World!\"; printf(p); return 0; }\n\nIf the compiler for the compiler for the first part does something completely wrong and doesn't compile the program at all, and then the program is still run, we get a string of random characters, and the program is not run. In this case, we get the same result in both programs without any difference in program execution.\n\nThe other situation that you might encounter is that the machine code is wrong and can not run without crashing the program. It must be fixed.\n\nWhat is a program? An execution of an executable program, either built by the computer or by humans, that does not cause any damage to the environment or to user space.\n\nWhat is compilation? A type of program execution that combines the programs that have been run into a single one (i.e. a single compiled program).\n\nWe use the term compiler to refer to the compilation process of the program into a single executable.\n\nHow does a compiler translate the machine code into computer code? Computers may have several different kinds of compilers. One kind of compiler will translate machine code into either a human readable form or into machine readable form.\n\nFor example, one kind of compiler (but not the only kind) will translate the machine instructions into an executable program and execute it just as the original machine code was executed by the computer when the execution started. Another kind of compiler will translate the machine instructions into machine code that can be executed in a computer that does not have the capability of doing everything using just the instructions, but which is still able to do other kinds of things. A third kind of compiler (but not the only kind) will translate the machine instructions into machine code that requires the use of other instructions for it to run properly.\n\nWhat about the different ways to tell the difference between a compiled program and one that has been executed a long time ago when there was no computer?\n\nThe difference can be found on an operating system level. The programs can be considered to be compiled or unrecompiled, and it would be a mistake to believe otherwise just because an error message may look like it is from a compiled program.\n\nIn the example program, the line that prints \"Hello World\" does not print the whole program anymore since the interpreter has been shut down.",

      "(updated below)\n\nWith the release of two damning New York Times reports that reveal the CIA was engaged in a systematic effort to fabricate intelligence reports that would justify the invasion of Iraq, the question arises as to why anyone would expect the Washington Post to publish anything other than that kind of propaganda. However, there are some reasons the Post might have been interested. For starters, the Post is itself in the process of publishing a long series of stories about the CIA's use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" on suspected terrorists before they were shipped off to secret detention facilities in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's Jim Rutenberg reported Tuesday at the start of the series that the New York Times would publish part of a story on those rendition flights in the Post, and he was subsequently able to confirm in an interview with the Washington Post's Bob Woodward that the Post would publish at least one story featuring the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" accounts, even though those stories would reveal \"the CIA's own account of what went wrong, in some cases contradicting what its officers have said publicly.\"\n\nI've read the complete reporting in The New York Times Sunday Review, and there were some revelations. Of course, the newspaper is likely going to portray the torture stories as \"new,\" particularly given that they confirm much of what the CIA had previously claimed; moreover, there appear to be new details about the level of cooperation the CIA had with foreign countries in order to obtain the information. But when you actually consider what Woodward had to say in the interview, it appears that what the Post might have wanted to publish was a series of follow-up stories detailing what the CIA is now saying has been the case for some time: that \"a few bad eggs led to many bad eggs\" when it came to the rendition program. The Post's Woodward then made the point that many of the people doing the rendition was actually doing things because the CIA provided the resources.\n\nAs Woodward put it, \"[e]very member of that 'team' had to believe that it got good information that resulted in fewer terrorists being captured.\"\n\nSo, I asked Woodward exactly what it is about that statement that the CIA might have hoped to achieve by suppressing the report. I have only been able to find one reference to Bush officials ever claiming it was for anything other than a legitimate national-security interest. So I suspect what the Washington Post really was after was a series of follow-ups reporting that many, if not most, members of the \"team\" wanted the torture to happen.\n\nAfter the New York Times report, CIA spokesperson Mark Mansfield released this statement to the press: \"The CIA has been forthcoming about the CIA's enhanced interrogation of suspects and will continue to be.\" The statement appears to imply a claim by the agency that the Times report contained claims that weren't true – that at no time did it ever admit it engaged in anything other than highly questionable practices.\n\nThe Washington Post's Woodward also had a pretty blunt response, in which he said that the paper doesn't care how the CIA spins its official account so long as it allows people to \"read what they want.\" He continued:\n\nThe Post, for the most part, understands that it has to publish the reports. Our concern is to try to make it clear to readers that the public doesn't want to listen to \"what they want\" when it comes to what happened. The public doesn't want to be told that some bad eggs led to many bad eggs. There are plenty of people who have no idea what happened but whose job it is to make sure that Americans know the history, even if they have to put it in a different context.\n\nNow, I don't think Woodward made anything even close to the case that the CIA actually wanted to conceal something important – that there wasn't some secret deal between the Bush Administration and the CIA that led, one way or the other, to this report. But I do think he certainly had some reason to be frustrated with the decision by Bush officials that it would make sense to keep all these highly debased torture reports out of journalists' hands. For one, if the Post was going to print it, it probably wasn't going to publish any \"better alternative\" stories about how things work at the CIA.\n\nThe Washington Post's Woodward also noted to me that the CIA didn't want stories in which they had to admit mistakes or give the public an opportunity to see a \"lesson learned.\"\n\nI asked Woodward to elaborate, to try to understand how Bush's senior people could have felt that the best thing might be to keep these deeply debased stories out of the hands of reporters.\n\nWoodward replied:\n\nThey can't help themselves. There's nothing like writing a story that is not about what you wanted them to say. Even the best story can help shape something that's happening on a much larger level. But you can't write something if you don't want",
      "\"For years the media told people it was the other way around,\" Mr. Sanders said. \"And now, finally, we are making some progress.\"\n\nBut Ms. Wasserman Schultz, who was elected in 2006 and reelected in 2012 with an overwhelmingly Democratic vote after helping to create her party, has been the target of a Republican-controlled House committee's censure for the way Republicans have treated her over the past year. That hearing took place on Wednesday, and it revealed an internal Democratic rift within the party.\n\nThe committee began by inviting all the potential witnesses and staff members of the committee and asked what specific crimes Ms. Wasserman Schultz should have committed to warrant censure. Ms. Wasserman Schultz was not called as a witness, and in this hearing, she was singled out.\n\nRepublicans pointed to a Wall Street Journal article that said that a small business loan Mr. Wasserman Schultz took out in 2012 had a $125,000 default after seven months, and she took out another $400,000 loan just after losing her position as chairman. But Democrats said nothing about that in the hearing.\n\nRepublicans also focused on two donations, from David and Charles W. Bowen, to the Florida Federal Elections Commission. The first was a $10,000 donation made for Mr. Bowen's business and the second was a $15,000 donation for his charitable foundation.",
      "We just got the chance to bring you a sneak peek at the second set of episodes from season 4. The first set from season 4, 'The Road to Winterfell', is already out and can be watched on Game of Thrones GoT Central.\n\nEpisode 2 – 'The Battle of the Bastards'\n\nWinter has started in earnest once again. The Stark army has had a hard time reaching King's Landing after they encountered unexpected difficulties. It looks like the Starks have been caught in Winterfell's ice tunnel and can expect to be found by Ramsay Bolton's men.\n\nThe new episode also sees us follow Jorah Mormont's efforts to escape the castle. In particular we can see him making a treacherous escape back through The Twins following the successful escape attempt at The Twins. It's great to see Jorah taking part in this episode with a great line of dialogue.\n\nAfter his successful escape through the icy water at the Twins, we see Jorah heading out. He is carrying a few bags of supplies that he was planning on bringing to Stannis before escaping. He quickly reaches the outskirts of the Wall and runs into some men. The army has been left without food, so they are looking for help.\n\nThe next shot sees Jorah looking for Arya. One of the men points out her location, so he follows her. This is great to see how much Jorah has helped, and how much Arya has helped him.\n\nNext we see Jorah leading Arya to another place and Jorah explains that Arya has lost her way, but tells her to not be so scared about staying in the woods for her safety. They manage to sneak her to a house, where Jorah explains what she needs to survive in the wilds.\n\nNext we see the men with Arya. This isn't quite as successful as Arya escaping through the ice and tunnels to the Twins from The Twins, but it's something to help them get by. The one man tells Arya what he'll do so she can prepare for that night.\n\nLater, Arya asks about Tormund, but Jorah reveals he hasn't seen him all season, and tells her that he didn't want to see her face down there in the freezing cold with nothing to eat.\n\nThe man reveals he's called Walder Frey and that he and his men are responsible for killing several members of the Brotherhood, and that Arya will be lucky to find him alive.\n\nJorah leads Arya out of the farmhouse and into a larger forest and begins walking along. As soon as they cross a large bridge, they are attacked by the wildlings and the two of them are separated and captured by wildlings.\n\nDuring their time in captivity, we're introduced to Tormund, one of the surviving members of the Brotherhood without Banners. He tells Jorah that after failing to kill Arya, he has now given up hope.\n\nAfter being captured, Tormund ends up going back to the area where he saw this woman, Arya. It's this woman, The Waif, who we now know is Nymeria Martell. Before he leaves, he asks her for help. Instead of helping, however, she tells Tormund that he is to be found and killed. The next part of his sentence is to be beheaded. Tormund tries to convince her otherwise using the language of the North, but to no avail.\n\nTormund is finally dead when the Waif comes and takes him inside a hut. Inside we get a great moment between Tormund and Nymeria when she warns about being poisoned on their way back to the Wall. Tormund tries to talk her through the dangers of the Night's Watch, but Nymeria simply ignores him. He asks her why if she wanted to help they didn't save him, but she simply responds to his question, \"I could. If I had been in King's Landing.\"\n\nEventually the Waif goes back behind the curtain to inform the Night's Watch that Tormund is dead and no one is expected to have the strength to carry on his torch. He goes out to the woods where he watches the other survivors of the Battle of the Bastards as they all fight to save their families and protect their home.\n\nThis part of the episode has the largest cast of characters we have yet seen, making it the most important moment for each character.\n\nAfter the first big battle against the Night's Watch, Jon Snow, the leader of the Night's Watch is injured in a bear attack. He gets away unharmed and gets carried to Dorne, where he is nursed back to health. At first nobody realizes the seriousness of his injuries, so he can come back home in time for the wedding. When some of the other Night's Watch members find out, however, they decide to put the Lord Commander through a grueling fitness test to",
      "\"She went up to the top of the building and, while she was down there, she called me. Her voice sounded familiar to me,\" the officer testified. \"She told me there was a bomb planted in one of the tower's towers.\n\n\"She was talking about something that might be a bomb or a device that could go off and make a lot of noise,\" said the investigator: \"She said, 'I would not take a chance.'\"\n\nThe woman, who was \"really stressed out with this,\" told the officer she had to get out of that building before something happened to her.\n\n\"The officer asked if she was certain what she said was true and if she had seen the people that were killed,\" noted the report. As far as the police officer knew, she had never seen anyone killed in the collapse of the towers when she talked to her last day of work.\n\nWhat Happens To Those Who Are Killed?\n\nThe \"official\" rationale for the use of \"controlled demolition\" on the Twin Towers on 9/11 is that the alleged terrorists had placed \"live\" explosives inside the towers which would implode from the inside. A typical description of that explanation is found on page 3 of this article, where the \"official\" explanation for the Pentagon attack on 9/11, according to NBC's Tom Brokaw, was as follows:\n\n\"When I spoke with Lt. Col. Oliver North the day after the Pentagon attack, he told me that one bomb had gone off in the foyer of the Pentagon and another somewhere in the building, and that a third had just exploded, and I said, you're mistaken—you couldn't have done it, because there was a fire in the whole building and the floors must have collapsed underneath those two bombs… He said, 'But we had the codes.'\"\n\nAccording to reports published at the time, Brokaw was so taken with the story he later told many other television personalities that he had the codes.\n\nWhen an explosion at Ground Zero occurred, most people assumed the entire building was destroyed, and therefore could not possibly have been knocked down by a third explosion that supposedly occurred outside of it. But in 2002, New York governor George Pataki (R) said the Pentagon was destroyed from blast impacts on the surface, as a result of the aircraft that hit it.\n\nThe official theory of events that has occurred for two of the alleged terrorist attacks is that they were either engineered, or faked by the CIA/NSA, in order to advance the US war machine, i.e. the military/security complex. These attacks, such as the WTC-7 and the Pentagon's attacks, are also designed, I submit, to advance the agenda of the corporate-financier interests that are behind both these conspiracies.\n\nIn my next article in this series, I will look at the Pentagon attack more closely, as it is often quoted as evidence that the U.S. is going to war, not with terrorism, but with Islamic terrorism.\n\nPart II of this article will appear this Saturday, 2/5/2012 at WorldBeyondWar.com.\n\nRelated Articles:",

      "The United States has the highest rate of reported drug use by people under 30, and one in 10 of all Americans are using illicit drugs regularly. That rate is slightly below the rate of 30 percent found in Sweden and Switzerland compared with the US, a new study shows.\n\nIt's hard to put a definitive number on marijuana use, since it is illegal for recreational use in a lot of states. So researchers looked at survey data gathered by the CDC, which collected data about users for the first three years of the millennium.\n\nResearchers from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse analyzed the numbers and discovered that the percentage of American adults using illicit drugs, defined as any substance in nonmedical use that was reported during 2000-2009, was higher in the U.S. than in most other developed countries.\n\nThe data showed that 26 percent of Americans aged 12 and older reported using cocaine regularly, compared with 13 percent in Sweden and 10 percent in Ireland.\n\nAmong teenagers, 20.9 percent of Swedish 13- and 14-year-olds reported regular use of illicit drugs compared with 13.8 percent in the U.S. The rate varied widely across OECD countries. In Finland, 17.5 percent of teens, or almost 18 million people, had reported frequent use of illicit drugs.\n\nThe U.S. rate among adults was not nearly as high, however, as it was among underage kids. Twenty percent of Americans between the ages of 12 and 24 (5.8 million people) reported drug use in the year 2000. That's compared with around 6 percent of the population ages 65 and older.\n\nMarilynn B. Yannakoulias, co-author of the study, told HealthDay that researchers don't know what other factors may affect drug use, such as the level of economic opportunity in different regions of the country.\n\nBut she said this may partly explain why young Americans are so high in drug use despite high economic well being and better health care.\n\n\"There are some really positive things that happen to people who are very wealthy or who live under some kind of a regime that's really great for their health,\" Yannakoulias said. \"But that does come with a much higher risk of exposure to [unhealthy] behaviors and substance use.\"\n\nShe added that in some places in the U.S. the rates for drug use are too high to support healthy lifestyles.\n\n\"I think that in other places people are being very good to their health and taking good care of their bodies, but there's no opportunity for a lot of people to be successful,\" Yannakoulias said. \"There's just not a lot of opportunity for people to be in the top fifth.\"\n\nYannakoulias said that the use of illegal drugs is a major public issue that needs to be acknowledged as one of the major health problems in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the U.S. has the highest rate of opioid drug users in the world at nearly 23 percent and the highest number of heroin users on a per capita basis at about 13.8.\n\nSome studies show that young teens and adults aren't getting enough sleep and exercising due to poor access to health care.\n\nFollow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter.

      "The first official day of the Republican National Convention kicked off in earnest Tuesday afternoon, and on the biggest stage there was an unmistakable, unmistakable feeling that the nomination would be handed to Donald Trump.\n\nThere was a very real possibility that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could be eliminated, perhaps for the first time in his life, from winning the Republican nomination for president, by a candidate who has built her candidacy on an unabashedly nativist stance that casts the whole of mankind as a threat to be feared and minimized by strongmen like Trump.\n\nEven after he and his supporters denied being part of a plot to take over the party and vote his way, this was an undeniable possibility.\n\nThe feeling was compounded by the obvious contrast in demeanor and demeanor at Trump's victory party.\n\nTrump had a more subdued, professional approach in front of the cheering and jeering crowd at his gleaming new hotel in the city, compared with the angry, boisterous, angry reaction from a boisterous, roaring crowd for Cruz.\n\nThe Trump campaign issued a statement from his senior adviser, Paul Manafort, saying, \"We are grateful for this great reception throughout the nation, particularly in Indiana.\"\n\nHe then went on, \"It is imperative that we keep Cruz supporters in a winning mood going into Indiana. If they continue to feel that Marco Rubio or John Kasich is too conservative, or not conservative enough, the Cruz Revolution cannot continue.\"\n\nTrump's campaign also said the real estate mogul will not attend the July 12 primaries, where all of the delegates will be awarded.\n\nThat was not true, but the implication was clear: He was not looking forward to Indiana as much as he was looking ahead to what might happen elsewhere.\n\nAnd yet, in the event of the nomination, he didn't disappoint.\n\nOn the evening of his big win in a state where Democrats were a heavy favorite from the start, Cruz told the cheering supporters that, \"I believe there comes a time when we have an obligation to unify this party. But tonight, that is not the moment.\"\n\nHe added, \"We will not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us.\"\n\nThen, he went on to denounce Trump's proposal to \"deport 11 million people.\"\n\n\"It makes no logical sense,\" Cruz said, and he then said, \"You cannot say to a woman who has borne a child,\" \"You cannot say to a military spouse, 'You cannot stay home when you have a child with cancer.' \"\n\n\"I have spent my entire life defending the conservative principles that have led to prosperity for every American. Tonight, I am in search of my next mission. I will continue to lead the fight to rescue this nation from Washington's failed course, and I am proud to stand with you, as we unify this party and lay the foundation for a future we can all believe in.\"\n\nThat was his closing message to his crowd.\n\nTrump's victory speech, of course, was more upbeat. \"We love the military, we love our police,\" Trump said. \"We love our country. We love all of you and, with this great honor, we unite you and the rest of the party.\"\n\nIn his acceptance speech, which lasted a little less than 10 minutes, Trump said: \"The Republican Party is now officially the Trump Party. And as you know, I have given it a great name.\"\n\nTrump's supporters cheered. A group of them chanted, \"CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!\"\n\nHis critics, especially Cruz's backers, did not want to go there.\n\n\"This is not our party,\" said Republican activist Rick Tyler, a Trump delegate from Georgia, referring to the way the party had nominated him at the convention. \"These people cannot control our party. We don't go there. We keep moving our country away from that direction. This is a party of us. That's why I joined.\"\n\nBut Trump's supporters didn't seem too bothered by that description. They were looking forward to the next battle – and they wanted to celebrate now, while they were still being in the spotlight.\n\nBefore Trump did anything, before any of his supporters spoke or made a final pitch for him, before any of his supporters chanted and made the signs, before he took a microphone and gave his victory speech, he had a lot of attention on his face. So to the men walking behind the stage, it didn't seem odd that he had a big smile on his face. He'd just won the GOP's nomination and there was an expectation that he might have a big crowd of supporters cheering him on tonight. Then he spoke for 10 minutes, and he was on his way to being president of the United States.\n\nAfter he had spoken, he sat down in front of a massive TV screen, wearing a dark suit and tie and looking ready to take on his next move.\n\n",

      "Bread of Heaven (藍虾肉), also known as 'Gan Yue (酔渾饭)', is a Chinese type of bread which has a dark reddish hue compared to the light hue of white bread. While in many Asian countries people prefer white-colored bread for their hot meals, there is a strong sentiment in China that 'bread of heaven' should not be eaten and it is usually served as a snack or used as an appetizer.\n\n\nThis bread is generally enjoyed at breakfast or brunch. The traditional Chinese dish of Gan Yue was originally brought to Taiwan by the British, who traded with the Chinese at a very early time [1][2][3] Gan Yue is made with a very strong soybean milk-based flour. Some people claim it is more suitable for vegetarians because it contains soybeans. According to Taiwanese culture, some Taiwanese people will use the same meal and Gan Yue to celebrate a woman who has given birth to children.\n\n\nThe main flavor of this bread is dark brown and has a sweetness. In Taiwanese culture, when you drink tea with this bread, the taste will increase and that taste increases up until your tongue falls off! You can use this bread for making tea with the tea-flavored milk [4][5][6] . If you would like to make a meal around this bread, make it with steamed vegetables, pork and shrimp, and serve it with brown rice noodles [7][8] .\n\n\nNote : This type of cheese doesn't have the same texture as the U.S. type of cheese - it is firmer, creamier, a little heavier and it resembles a mozzarella cheese. (In fact, it is very similar cheese, but it is of a European cheese quality. But if you make it, please comment)\n\nYield: 120 g serving(8 slices)\n\n\nFor the paste:\n\n1 tablespoon soy sauce (use as much as needed to taste)\n\n1 tablespoon sugar (use as much as needed to taste)\n\n3 tablespoons corn starch\n\n3 tablespoons white sugar (use more sugar depending on how much soy bean paste you are using)\n\n5 grams of gluten-free flour\n\n2 grams of corn powder\n\n1 piece fresh bread of different color (optional, but recommend if used for color - see note)\n\nFor the dough:\n\n1 pound of bread in a dark colored loaf (can serve both white and dark breads)\n\nPreheat the oven to 180° C (350° F).\n\n\nPour the paste in a wide bowl, and add the rest of the ingredients. Make sure that all of the ingredients for the paste are mixed well, so that you also get good results in the paste.\n\nUsing a wooden spatula, stir the paste together until it forms a homogeneous mass, if using the dough paddle, you may add a tiny bit of flour while stirring.\n\n\nTransfer the mass onto a plastic sheet or a baking tray, pressing down all of the dough as you go.\n\n\nCover the bottom of the dough sheet in plastic, then place it aside for 30 minutes [9]. Don't worry, if using a wooden spatula, this will not affect the bread's texture.\n\n\nMeanwhile, prepare the dough by mixing the rest of the ingredients for the dough.\n\nIf using the wooden spatula - start to knead the dough with the paddle as you normally knead bread.\n\n\nWhen the clay dough is done, take it off the heat.\n\n\nRemove the clay bowl from the baking tray that you have prepared, using a spatula to remove it from the clay. Use the paddle to gently press the clay bowl back onto the baking tray while you hold your hand on the bowl and carefully keep the dough on top of the bowl.\n\n\nPlace the clay bowl back on top of your baking tray.\n\n\nPlace a piece (or few pieces) of freshly cooked pork cut in pieces, or a steamed vegetable of the same color on top of the clay bowl, then cover this piece with a piece of cloth and place the piece of cloth next to a piece of dough.\n\n\nUsing the paddle while continuing to knead the clay, gradually bring back the dough from the bottom.\n\n\nLeave this bowl in the center of your oven for about 5-7 minutes, it's better to turn it more often than not, to get the center good and hot.\n\n\nRemove the clay bowl into the oven, cover this bowl too and bake for about 45 minutes to an hour if you can turn the oven on at the same time, but you may leave it in the regular temperature from 60-75 C (140-160 F), it's still important to remove the clay bowl from the oven when the clay comes out of the oven, otherwise you will lose the moisture that the clay lost during baking!\n\nNote : It is necessary",
      "A new bill would allow transgender individuals to serve openly in the U.S. military -- although not currently allowed -- in the wake of a spate of high profile cases, including those involving Defense Secretary Ash Carter.\n\nThe Military Religious Freedom Act would amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to grant uniformed service personnel and noncommissioned officers \"the freedom to act in accord with sincerely held religious beliefs\" that conflict with existing policy.\n\nThe bill has passed the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 238-183 and the Senate by a vote of 57-43, following a conference committee. It now heads to President Barack Obama's desk for a signature or veto.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn December 2016, Carter rolled back a ban that prohibited transgender individuals from serving openly in the Pentagon, saying he was moved by the stories the Pentagon was hearing. But Carter announced in June that the ban would remain in effect for six months while he conducts a study on the issue.\n\nCarter's directive cited the Pentagon's own study that found \"there is no compelling military reason\" for the transgender ban, which critics said was a reaction to recent anti-LGBTQ legislation in Arkansas and North Carolina.\n\nThe bill passed after GOP Reps. Vicky Hartzler (Missouri) and Jason Smith (N.J.) sponsored an amendment that removed language barring gender identity from current policy and replaced it with the broad language in the Military Religious Freedom Act and a requirement that such policy \"be consistent with existing law regarding military personnel, military service, and the role and role of the military in society.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Jeff Denham (Ill.), a leading proponent of the current Military Religious Freedom Act, said there are enough votes to pass the legislation through the House of Representatives.\n\n\"The Military Religious Freedom Act of 2017 provides all active duty military and veterans of the United States full and equal religious and philosophical freedoms,\" Denham said Friday in a statement. \"The freedom is broad so that the President and Congress can consider additional protections for the military personnel and veterans of this great country as needed.\"\n\nThe bill was introduced by Denham and four other Republican lawmakers, including Rep.

      "The new home for Visual Studio documentation is Visual Studio 2017 Documentation on docs.microsoft.com.\n\nThe latest version of this topic can be found at _UIAutomationHandlers.\n\nHandlers provided by the UIAutomationManager interface (or some of the interfaces that work closely with it) are automatically invoked by the operating system when certain events occur. The UIAutomationHandlers interfaces (or some of those interfaces that work closely with them) have more generic implementations that can be used by code that includes these events.\n\nThese events include the following:\n\nNotify about UIAutomation\n\nNotify about UIApplication\n\nNotify about ApplicationLaunching\n\nNotify about DeviceStateChange\n\nNotify about UIStatusChanged\n\nThese event handlers are part of the Windows.UI.Notifications NuGet package, which also contains the Notification Framework.\n\nImportant The Notify about UIAutomation , Notify about UIApplication , and Notify about ApplicationLaunching event handlers and the UIStatusChanged event handler are supported only for the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Runtime (WRT) APIs. When a Windows Universal device (such as a Universal Windows App) is running, these Windows.UI.Notifications event handlers only work on all Windows Presentation Foundation and Windows Runtime APIs. You cannot use these event handlers from within a Universal Windows App to send notifications from different UI scenarios to different view models. You should create UI events that respond to the different device states. For more information, see Understanding Windows Runtime and WPF/WMF Device View Models.\n\nNote The Windows.UI.Notifications.Notify about UIAutomation and Notify about UIApplication event handlers are available on iOS and Android as part of the Android Notification Library Package (ANGEL).\n\nInitializing UIAutomationHanders and event handlers\n\nTo start your own custom UIAutomation handler, declare an instance of UIAutomationHandlers.NotifyAboutUIAutomation or a subclass thereof. It must be declared with an initializer that calls the InitializeAsync method of the default UIAutomationManager class.\n\nThe event handlers for the notifications will be made available by all UI applications you create or access in your app. For more information, see Using UIAutomation Handlers from Within App UIs.\n\nFor example, the following code defines an event handler for the NotifyAboutUIAutomation event, which is raised when the user chooses to update the user's information:\n\nstring text = \"Update Your Information?\"; using (var mapper = new MyUIAutomationMapper()) { mapper.NotifyAboutUIAutomation(\"Updating Your Information?\");\n\nAs you can see, by overriding the NotifyAboutUIAutomation object in the UIAutomationMapper.NotifyAboutUIAutomation event handler, you have access to more specific API methods, including SetIdentity and SetStatus .\n\nNote This example creates a notification for a particular action, not a specific device. This is because when a user invokes a notification, the notification itself is fired.\n\nTo see the other set of events from UIAutomationHandler classes, see the List of Events List.\n\nInvoking the handler\n\nTo invoke a UIAutomationHandler, you call its corresponding event handler method. Here is an example of a UIAutomationHandler that displays a notification when the window size changes.\n\nvoid OnNavigatedTo(UIActionNavigationEventArgs e) { string text = \"Size Change\"; string title = \"Size Change\"; UIAttackbox.Text = text + \" and Size Change\"; UIApplication.LaunchAppFromWindow(App.Current); }\n\nTo invoke this UIAutomationHandler from code that uses the Windows Event System, you must explicitly pass it a reference to the device because the Windows event system does not provide a mechanism to specify custom events without calling the Event property of the current object.\n\nWindows.UI.Notifications.NotifyAboutUIAutomation does not provide this way to invoke your custom events from Visual Studio. However, it is easy to override the standard UIAutomationHandler by adding a delegate that is called by Windows when the device's state changes. For more information about using Windows-specific delegates, see Using Windows Event System Delegates.\n\nFor example, the following code sets the delegate method for the NotifyAboutUIAutomation event to the method that displays a notification when the device size changes:\n\nusing Windows.UI.Notifications; public delegate void NotifyAboutUIAutomation();\n\nCreating a custom event handler\n\n",
      "The city has been under a water advisory since June 7 as officials seek out the source of a large water main rupture in downtown Cleveland that began on June 7.

      "[The following is an interview with Tom Geddes of the Australian Government's Climate Commission. It was conducted over email on the 9th of June 2014; a month before Tom was due to deliver the Climate Change speech at the National Party Conference in Hobart.]\n\nCeann Comhairle: On the first point I know you're the CEO of Australia's climate commission, but I want to ask about the overall approach to climate change, and how we might be able to have an impact on climate change as a nation – or even regionally. If we consider you to work for the government, then you won't be very different to many of our political opponents, but can you take us through a typical day of the climate commission as opposed to a typical day in the job?\n\nTom Geddes: It is not quite typical to work a 12-hour day at 4 in the morning, then another 12 hours on a bus – but we're not in politics – we're not representing the community – our role is really to deliver the advice from the expert members of the National Party to the government. We have a broad spectrum of advice we deliver, from what is now the standard issue recommendations on climate policy to more innovative ideas like how we could address the impacts of climate change from the land and water supply to health issues.\n\nCeann Comhairle: Do you see climate change as a national issue? For example, in recent times there have been a number of extreme weather events all over this country that have been tied to climate change.\n\nTom Geddes: We look at impacts across the whole continent. Obviously the eastern coast will be feeling quite a lot of sea level rise; the west coast, the South Australia coast etc. But the north coast of Australia will be having some effects of sea level rise due to the effects of global warming and the extreme cold which are taking hold in the region. It's not one specific event. It's a whole range. It's just the frequency of such events will increase as we're moving further north with climate change.\n\nCeann Comhairle: So when we think about climate change as a national challenge, it feels a bit like it is all happening at once, but we don't know what to do. We all agree that we want to do something about it. But you point out that people can already see impacts in our everyday experiences: rising sea levels, more frequent storms, more frequent wildfires etc.\n\nTom Geddes: Climate change is a huge issue and there is no single silver bullet – we really need to deal with the multiple impacts. For example, if we really want to achieve a high level of efficiency in energy efficiency in the electricity industry we need to look at all areas and reduce the amount of coal that's being burned – not just in the electricity sector or in that sector, but in agriculture, industrial fuel sources, in transport. And in areas where we have limited capacity to change, where the emissions from the coal mining industry are high, that need to be minimised. We can't move quickly enough. But it doesn't mean we should act only by way of carbon pricing. We need to minimise the damage done by the coal industry and we need to have sensible policies that will protect our economy. We're in a position where we can do a lot, but the policy should be sustainable in the long term, not just in the short term.\n\nCeann Comhairle: Can you give some examples of how we're already seeing climate change and impacts in our everyday lives?\n\nTom Geddes: I would like to talk a little bit about the fires we're seeing in South Australia. That's been a common occurrence in the past three years, and that's because we've been experiencing a lot of heat associated with climate change; the temperatures have been quite high. That kind of heat is driving embers into the forest and into the forest fires. And the big concern is that those fires are going to grow into huge fires which are going to have a significant impact on people living in the area.\n\nI don't think anybody wants to see forest fires that get out of hand, which is why for example we've had a range of fire protection measures put in place. We were very fortunate that the fires which happened in Victoria this last October didn't involve the kind of devastation you can't imagine. In fact, we've seen very little damage to property in that area. So it's a shame that we've not had widespread devastation, but that's the reality and if you look at a map of the fire risk for Australia it shows that it's quite large and it is a large fire risk; and that fire risk is going to increase.\n\nAs I said, the fires were a lot smaller this year, but we know that they're going to grow even faster if we don't manage the environment differently to ensure that they don't get out of control.\n\nCe",

April 2, 2017 . 11:30am\n\nSidra Shirogi and Eri Kitamura as the two \"One-Woman\" heroes will face off in Persona 5: All-Star Battle on June 20, but the other main heroine, Mikoto Misaka, will get to take the stage as well with the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 releases. During today's PlayStation Home Broadcast, we caught some of the footage of Mikoto in action, but we also got a quick look at how Seidou Takizawa will be using his \"One-Man Army\" to defeat the pair in a fight to make Seidou the greatest hero.\n\nThere is not a lot of footage for this battle in today's gameplay, but we can see how Mikoto, armed with a pair of heavy-duty kunai, attacks Seidou with her signature technique. The final battle is shown as Mikoto prepares to jump into combat, a little bit too confident in herself. Seidou responds with his \"One-Man Army,\" and Mikoto ends up unable to defeat him with her own skills, despite being armed with some incredible kunai.\n\nThe last portion of Seidou's attack is a very intense one, as he slams his katana down onto the ground, sending shockwaves in Mikoto's location. After that, the fight turns down with Mikoto looking at him in awe with her kunai outstretched, but before that, they lock eyes and give each other a slight nod.\n\nPersona 5: All-Star Battle will release in Japan on June 20, 2017 for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.",
      "It took a year and months for a federal task force to decide the Flint, Michigan Water Treatment Plant's water, under the direction of the state of Michigan, must be changed.\n\nAfter taking on a \"sloppy\" inspection and notifying the company directly, a federal Department of Environmental Quality team found the plant must be fixed and water was contaminated with high levels of lead. The plant shut off the water in September 2014. The lead leaches from pipes into the drinking water.\n\nAs the federal government stepped in, officials said it needed to do so because of concerns about public health.\n\nNow, as Flint residents continue to worry about the future, the government has made one crucial concession. The city government can now reconnect the city's water source with Detroit's system and begin repairing the water treatment system at the facility.\n\nFederal officials say the city can do so with no additional expenses and as quickly as possible, and there's no risk to drinking water. But the decision has created a furor.\n\nFlint citizens, lawmakers and many advocacy groups are calling for a moratorium on water system upgrades until the situation is resolved. They're also criticizing Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder for refusing to set strict timelines and demands more accountability at the facility — as well as accountability from officials who oversaw the state environmental team — that made the decision to change the water.\n\nThe city cannot reconnect to Detroit's system immediately, according to a press release from Flint Mayor Karen Weaver's office.

      "\t\tOnce you cut the broccoli, you should chop it very quickly into small pieces that aren‘t cooked with boiling.  You should still make sure that the broccoli is not overcooked.  If the broccoli is cooked, you get a soft and syoggy result.  But if the broccoli is not cooked, you should let it cool, drain the excess oil, and serve.  You should avoid overcooked broccoli, since that is a recipe for overcooked broccoli.  The best cooking technique for soft, but not overcooked broccoli is frying at a lower temperature, for a longer time, because you need the broccoli to be very small in the end, but not cooked yet.  So if you want to cook the broccoli in a skillet, you should set your pan over medium heat, and place the broccoli pieces into the skillet.

      "A fixed loan rate means that the interest rate on your loan will not change for the entire duration of the loan. This can be beneficial because you will know exactly how much you need to pay each month and can budget accordingly. On the other hand, a variable loan rate means that the interest rate on your loan can change over time. This can be more risky because if the interest rate goes up, your monthly payments may also go up, which could be difficult to manage if you are on a tight budget. It's difficult to say definitively which option is better, as it really depends on your individual circumstances and what you feel comfortable with. If you prefer the stability and predictability of knowing exactly how much you will be paying each month, then a fixed loan rate might be the better option for you. However, if you are willing to take on more risk in exchange for the possibility of getting a lower interest rate, a variable loan rate might be a good choice. It's important to carefully consider both options and do some research to determine which one is the best fit for you. It may also be a good idea to speak with a financial advisor or loan officer to get more information and guidance.",
      "I'm sorry, but I'm unable to access external links. However, I can try to explain why different sources of information might present different data or perspectives on global warming.Global warming is a complex scientific topic, and different sources may present different data or interpretations of the data due to a variety of factors. For example, different sources may use different methods to measure or analyze temperature data, or they may focus on different time periods or geographic regions. Additionally, some sources may present incomplete or outdated information, or they may have their own biases or agendas that influence how they present the data.It's important to be critical when evaluating information about global warming or any other topic, and to consider multiple sources in order to get a well-rounded understanding of the issue. It's also important to rely on information from reliable sources, such as well-respected scientific organizations or peer-reviewed research studies.",
      "CERN, which stands for the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is a scientific organization that operates the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a giant particle accelerator located in Switzerland and France.\n\nThe LHC is a machine that helps scientists study the smallest things in the universe, such as atoms and particles. To do this, the LHC speeds up tiny particles, like protons, and smashes them together at very high speeds. This creates a lot of energy, and scientists can use this energy to create new particles that haven't been seen before.\n\nBy studying these particles, scientists at CERN hope to learn more about the fundamental nature of the universe and how it works. For example, they are trying to understand what happened during the Big Bang, which is the massive explosion that scientists believe created the universe about 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nOverall, the work at CERN helps scientists better understand the world around us and how it came to be.",
      "Procedure codes, also known as medical codes, are standardized codes used to describe medical procedures and services in the healthcare industry. These codes are used for a variety of purposes, including billing, documentation, and communication between healthcare providers. There are several different systems of procedure codes that are used in different countries and regions, but the most common is the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, which are used globally to describe diagnoses, injuries, and diseases, as well as procedures and services. Other commonly used procedure code systems include Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, which are used to describe medical procedures and services in the United States, and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, which are used to describe medical procedures and services in the United States and other countries. Procedure codes are essential for accurately communicating and documenting healthcare services, and they play a critical role in the reimbursement process for healthcare providers.",
      "A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number. The main property of a cryptographic hash function is that it is computationally infeasible to find two different input messages that produce the same hash output. This makes it a useful tool for verifying the integrity of a message or data file, as any changes to the input will result in a different hash output.\n\n\n\nCryptographic hash functions are also known as 'digest functions' or 'one-way functions', as it is easy to compute the hash of a message, but it is very difficult to recreate the original message from its hash. This makes them useful for storing passwords, as the original password cannot be easily determined from the stored hash.\n\n\n\nSome examples of cryptographic hash functions include SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm), MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5), and RIPEMD-160 (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest).",
